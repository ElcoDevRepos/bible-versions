In biblical context, "iniquities" refer to moral perversity or sinfulness. The imagery of being "entrapped" suggests a snare or trap, a common metaphor in Scripture for the consequences of sin (<a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15-16</a>). The idea is that sin is not just an external act but a condition that leads to one's downfall. Historically, traps were used for hunting, and this metaphor would resonate with an ancient audience familiar with the dangers of being caught unawares. Theologically, this reflects the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where one's actions inevitably lead to consequences. <p><b>the cords of his sin entangle him.</b><br>The "cords" symbolize the binding and restrictive nature of sin. In ancient times, cords or ropes were used to bind prisoners, indicating a loss of freedom. This imagery suggests that sin, while initially appearing to offer freedom or pleasure, ultimately leads to bondage. The concept of being "entangled" is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which warns believers to lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of liberation from sin through Christ, who offers freedom from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>). The entanglement of sin is a reminder of the need for divine intervention and redemption, pointing to the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

From the universal statement of God's omniscience and the Divine judgment, the teacher passes to the fate of the profligate. His end is inevitable ruin and misery. The deep moral lesson conveyed is that sin carries with it its own Nemesis. Adultery and impurity, like all sin of which they are forms, are retributive. The career of the adulterer is a career begun, continued, and ended in folly (comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31, 32</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>; and <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his manifold sins shall overtake and arrest him. The imagery is borrowed from the snare of the fowler. The emphatic form of the original, "His sins shall overtake him, the impious man," point conclusively to the adulterer. It is "his" sins that shall overtake him, not those of another, and they shall fall upon his own head; and further, his character is depicted in the condemning clause, "the impious man;" for such he is. <span class="accented">Shall take.</span> The verb <span class="accented">lakad</span> is literally "to take or catch animals in a snare or net," properly "to strike with a net." The wicked man becomes entangled and caught in his own sins; he is struck down and captured by them, just as the prey is struck by the snare of the fowler. The verb is, of course, used metaphorically, as in <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. <span class="accented">The wicked</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">eth-harasa</span>); in the original introduced as explanatory of the object, "him." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</span> The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate in rendering "his sins," instead of the original "his sin" (<span class="accented">khattatho</span>). It is not so much every sin of man which shall hold him, though this is true, as the particular sin treated of in the address, viz. adultery, which shall do this. The expression, "the cords of his sin" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khavley khattatho</span>), means the cords which his sin weaves around him. Nothing else will be requisite to bind and hold him fast for punishment (cf. "cords of vanity," in <a href="/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The iniquities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1493;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#183;w&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5771.htm">Strong's 5771: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iniquity, guilt, punishment for iniquity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a wicked man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">entrap him;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(yil&#183;k&#601;&#183;&#7695;u&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; third person masculine singular, Paragogic nun<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3920.htm">Strong's 3920: </a> </span><span class="str2">To catch, to capture, occupy, to choose, to cohere</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cords</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yit&#183;t&#257;&#183;m&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2256.htm">Strong's 2256: </a> </span><span class="str2">A rope, a measuring line, a district, inheritance, a noose, a company, a throe, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his own sin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1437;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2403.htm">Strong's 2403: </a> </span><span class="str2">An offence, its penalty, occasion, sacrifice, expiation, an offender</span><br /><br /><span class="word">entangle him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7687;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8551.htm">Strong's 8551: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sustain, to obtain, keep fast, to help, follow close</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 5:22 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare (Prov.
