The act of taking a garment signifies a tangible assurance or security for a debt. In biblical times, a person's outer garment was not only a piece of clothing but also a valuable possession, often used as a pledge (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>). The wisdom here is to protect oneself from potential loss when someone guarantees a loan for a stranger, highlighting the importance of prudence and responsibility in financial matters. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and the need to be wise with resources (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>).<p><b>get collateral if it is for a foreigner.</b><br>The mention of a "foreigner" underscores the increased risk associated with lending to someone outside one's community. In ancient Israel, foreigners were often not bound by the same social and legal obligations as Israelites, making the recovery of debts more challenging. This part of the proverb emphasizes the necessity of securing collateral to mitigate risk. The cultural context here is significant, as it reflects the societal norms and legal practices of the time, where community ties and mutual accountability were crucial. This advice aligns with the broader biblical theme of exercising discernment and caution in interactions with those who may not share the same values or commitments (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guarantor.htm">The Guarantor</a></b><br>This is the person who offers security or a pledge for another's debt.

In Old Testament culture the outer cloak was essential, often a person&#8217;s most valuable possession and even used as bedding at night (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning the garment, Scripture underscores the seriousness of the warning: the cosigner&#8217;s own necessities may become the payment.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16 and 22</a>:26-27, where the same imagery calls us to wisdom and prudence.<p>&#8226; The literal exhortation affirms that tangible consequences are appropriate when someone foolishly endangers his household through rash financial promises (cf. <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of him who posts security</b><p>To &#8220;post security&#8221; is to guarantee another person&#8217;s debt, what we would call co-signing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a> declares, &#8220;He who puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns against assuming obligations we cannot control, affirming personal responsibility (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse does not forbid generosity; rather, it condemns careless pledges that neglect stewardship and endanger one&#8217;s family (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a stranger</b><p>The borrower here is &#8220;a stranger,&#8221; someone outside the cosigner&#8217;s immediate circle.<p>&#8226; Helping the poor (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>) is righteous, yet wisdom distinguishes mercy from folly.<p>&#8226; When motives or reliability are unknown, the risk multiplies; caution is love in action, protecting all involved (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is to vet situations prayerfully, not to reject charity but to exercise discernment (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>get collateral</b><p>If a pledge must be given, Scripture instructs, &#8220;get collateral.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Collateral transfers risk back to the borrower and enforces accountability (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; This principle respects both parties: the lender is safeguarded, and the borrower is reminded of the debt&#8217;s weight (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusing collateral tempts irresponsibility; securing it models God&#8217;s orderly design for economic dealings (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if it is for a foreigner</b><p>A &#8220;foreigner&#8221; intensifies the warning: the lender has even less relational leverage.<p>&#8226; With no shared community bonds, recovering losses becomes harder (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom anticipates complications by requiring strong guarantees when trust is naturally thin (<a href="/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The counsel protects God&#8217;s people from naivety while still allowing them to act justly and kindly (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a> teaches practical, godly prudence: do not jeopardize your family by casually guaranteeing another person&#8217;s debt.
