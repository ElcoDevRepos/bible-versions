In biblical times, the concept of "neighbor" extended beyond those living nearby to include anyone with whom one had dealings. The command to love one's neighbor is central to biblical teaching, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>. The idea is to foster a community of trust and support, reflecting God's love and provision.<p><b>&#8220;Come back tomorrow and I will provide&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse warns against procrastination in doing good. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality and generosity were highly valued. Delaying assistance could be seen as a breach of social and moral duty. The urgency in providing help is echoed in <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>, where faith is demonstrated through immediate action. The phrase also highlights the importance of integrity and reliability in one's promises.<p><b>&#8212;when you already have the means.</b><br>This clause underscores the responsibility to act when one is able. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are accountable for the resources God has entrusted to them. The parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>) illustrates this principle, showing that true neighborliness involves using one's resources to meet the needs of others. The verse challenges believers to reflect God's generosity, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God supplies all needs according to His riches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a neighbor refers to anyone with whom we have a relationship or encounter in our daily lives. This could be a literal neighbor, a friend, or even a stranger in need.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. His teachings often focus on practical living and moral integrity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical backdrop of Proverbs, where community living and mutual support were essential for survival and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_generosity.htm">Immediate Generosity</a></b><br>The verse encourages us to act promptly in generosity. When we have the means to help, we should not delay, as procrastination can lead to missed opportunities to bless others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>By providing for others when we have the means, we demonstrate trust in God's continued provision for our own needs. This reflects a heart of faith and reliance on God's abundance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br><a href="/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a> reminds us of our responsibility to our community.

The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, "Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today." This "putting off" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thy neighbour;</span> <span class="accented">l'reayka</span>, "to thy friends," the word being evidently used distributively. <span class="accented">Reeh</span> is "a companion" or "friend" (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">amico tuo</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">sodali tuo</span>), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "neighbour." The Authorized Version correctly renders "come again," as <span class="accented">shav</span> is not merely "to return," but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">revertere</span>; and as the words, "tomorrow I will give thee," show. The LXX. adds, "For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth," probably from <a href="/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, "A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour." Seneca says in the same spirit, "Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit," "The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also <span class="accented">Bis dat qui cito dat.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1432;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your neighbor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1498;&#1464;&#1448; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7453.htm">Strong's 7453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion, fellow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tomorrow&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4279.htm">Strong's 4279: </a> </span><span class="str2">Deferred, the morrow, tomorrow, hereafter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will provide</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;et&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when you have the means.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3426.htm">Strong's 3426: </a> </span><span class="str2">Being, substance, existence, is</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-28.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:28 Don't say to your neighbor Go (Prov.
