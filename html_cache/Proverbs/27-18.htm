In ancient Israel, fig trees were a common and valuable source of food, symbolizing prosperity and sustenance. Tending a fig tree required patience and care, as it takes time for the tree to mature and bear fruit. This reflects the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, where Paul speaks about reaping what one sows. The fig tree is also a symbol of Israel in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/24.htm">Jeremiah 24</a>, where the health of the fig tree often parallels the spiritual state of the nation. This phrase encourages believers to be diligent in their responsibilities, promising that such diligence will lead to personal benefit and sustenance.<p><b>and he who looks after his master will be honored</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of loyalty and service. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, servants or stewards who faithfully served their masters were often rewarded with honor and sometimes even elevated to positions of greater responsibility, as seen in the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39-41</a>. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about faithful service in parables such as the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). The concept of honoring one's master can also be seen as a type of Christ, where believers are called to serve Christ faithfully, with the promise of eternal reward and honor in His kingdom (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>). This phrase encourages believers to serve with integrity and loyalty, trusting that God will honor their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fig_tree.htm">Fig Tree</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, fig trees were common and valued for their fruit.

Scripture repeatedly commends this kind of steady diligence. <a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a> reminds us, &#8220;He who works his land will have plenty of bread,&#8221; and <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a> shows that work was part of God&#8217;s good design from the beginning. By tending the tree, the worker shows commitment, foresight, and perseverance&#8212;traits the Lord consistently blesses (<a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will eat its fruit</b><p>God links faithful labor to appropriate reward. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a> teaches that &#8220;whatever a man sows, he will reap,&#8221; encouraging us not to grow weary in doing good because &#8220;at the proper time we will reap a harvest.&#8221; In the same way, the caretaker of the fig tree enjoys the sweetness of what he has cultivated. <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a> says, &#8220;All hard work brings a profit,&#8221; echoing the promise that effort invested under God&#8217;s wisdom brings tangible return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who looks after his master</b><p>The second image shifts from agriculture to service. Just as the tree-keeper cares for his crop, an employee or servant watches over the interests of the one in authority. <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-24</a> urges servants to obey &#8220;in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord,&#8221; knowing they ultimately serve Christ. Examples abound: David faithfully played his harp for Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>), and Elisha poured water on Elijah&#8217;s hands before inheriting a double portion (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>). Loyalty, attentiveness, and integrity mark a trustworthy caretaker.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be honored</b><p>Honor follows faithfulness. <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> asks, &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings.&#8221; Jesus echoes this principle: &#8220;Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he returns&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-43.htm">Luke 12:43-44</a>). God Himself promises, &#8220;Those who honor Me I will honor&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>). Whether recognition comes from earthly masters or directly from the Lord, diligent service does not go unnoticed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a> draws a straight line between faithful effort and fitting reward. Cultivate what God has entrusted&#8212;whether a fig tree, a vocation, or a relationship&#8212;and you will partake of its fruit. Serve those in authority with wholehearted devotion, and in God&#8217;s timing honor will follow.

The abundance of the produce of this tree makes it a good figure of the reward of faithful service. Septuagint, "He that planteth a fig tree shall eat the fruits thereof" (<a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm">2 Timothy 2:6</a>). So he that waiteth on his maser shall be honoured. He who pays attention, has loving regard to his master, shall meet with honour as his reward at his master's hands, and also from all who become acquainted with his merits. The gnome may well be applied to the case of those who do true and laudable service to their heavenly Master, and she shall one day hear from his lips the gracious word, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/27-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whoever tends</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5341.htm">Strong's 5341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To watch, guard, keep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fig tree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1488;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8384.htm">Strong's 8384: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of foreign derivation, the fig</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its fruit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(pir&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6529.htm">Strong's 6529: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fruit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and he who looks after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8104.htm">Strong's 8104: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hedge about, guard, to protect, attend to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his master</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_113.htm">Strong's 113: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sovereign, controller</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be honored.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7733;ub&#183;b&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3513.htm">Strong's 3513: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be heavy, weighty, or burdensome</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/27-18.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 27:18 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat (Prov.
