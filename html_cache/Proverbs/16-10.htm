The idea of a "divine verdict" suggests that the king's pronouncements were considered to be guided by divine wisdom. This reflects the belief that God granted authority and insight to the king, as seen in the reign of Solomon, who was renowned for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>). The king's role as a judge and leader was to reflect God's justice and righteousness, aligning with the biblical principle that all authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>his mouth must not betray justice.</b><br>The expectation that a king's mouth "must not betray justice" underscores the importance of integrity and righteousness in leadership. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, justice was a central duty of the king, who was responsible for maintaining order and fairness in society. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for individuals to "act justly and to love mercy." The king's role as a type of Christ is evident here, as Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate righteous judge (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>), who embodies perfect justice and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom and his role as a king who sought to rule with justice and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The context of the proverb is set in the ancient Near Eastern culture where kings were seen as God's appointed rulers, responsible for maintaining justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_verdict.htm">Divine Verdict</a></b><br>This refers to the belief that a king's decisions and judgments are guided by divine wisdom and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders, especially those in positions of authority, are called to seek divine wisdom in their decisions.

When a king speaks to resolve disputes, he is meant to echo the Lord&#8217;s own righteous judgments (compare <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;divine verdict&#8221; reminds us that final authority belongs to the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>), yet He chooses to communicate justice through governing leaders.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s kings were required to write out and daily read the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>), ensuring that their pronouncements aligned with God&#8217;s revealed standards.<p>&#8226; For modern readers, the principle extends to any sphere of authority&#8212;parents, employers, civil servants&#8212;calling each to seek God&#8217;s wisdom so their words carry heaven&#8217;s weight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;his mouth must not betray justice&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Because the king speaks for God, he is bound to absolute fairness. Betraying justice&#8212;twisting facts, favoring the powerful, or neglecting the powerless&#8212;would misrepresent the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently connects right speech with righteous character (<a href="/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>; 31:8&#8211;9). When leaders guard their mouths, nations flourish; when they don&#8217;t, people suffer (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, this calls leaders to:<p>&#8211; Listen carefully before ruling (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8211; Weigh evidence impartially (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Uphold truth even when costly (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers under authority are urged to pray that those over them will honor justice (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1&#8211;2</a>), recognizing that God still works through human rulers to restrain evil and promote good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10</a> teaches that God places His own verdict on a ruler&#8217;s lips, charging every leader to mirror His justice in word and deed.

This verse recalls the days of Solomon's youth, when it was his highest aspiration to judge his people righteously (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm" title="Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?">1Kings 3:9</a>).

David's noble words (<a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm" title="The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.">2Samuel 23:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Divine sentence is in the lips of the king.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">quesem</span>) is "divination," "soothsaying," oracular utterance. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The king's words have, in people's minds, the certainty and importance of a Divine oracle, putting an end to all controversy or division of opinion. It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man," cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (<a href="/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>). The Greeks could say - <p><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <p><span class="accented">"God's very living image is the king."</span> And thus his utterances were regarded as irrefragably true and decisive. <span class="cmt_word">His month transgresseth not in judgment.</span> The decisions which he gives are infallible, and, at any rate, irresistible. We may refer to Solomon's famous verdict concerning the two mothers (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc.), and such sentences as <a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>, "By me (wisdom) kings reign, and princes decree justice" (see below on ver. 12; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); and David's words (<a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>), "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God" (Wisd. 9:4, 10, 12). Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, "In the judgment his mouth should not err." The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/16-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A divine verdict</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1462;&#1444;&#1505;&#1462;&#1501; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(qe&#183;sem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7081.htm">Strong's 7081: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lot, divination, oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the lips</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;ip&#772;&#183;&#7791;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8193.htm">Strong's 8193: </a> </span><span class="str2">The lip, language, a margin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a king;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mouth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">should not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">betray</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4603.htm">Strong's 4603: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cover up, to act covertly, treacherously</span><br /><br /><span class="word">justice.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4941.htm">Strong's 4941: </a> </span><span class="str2">A verdict, a sentence, formal decree, divine law, penalty, justice, privilege, style</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/16-10.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 16:10 Inspired judgments are on the lips (Prov.
