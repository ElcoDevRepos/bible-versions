In ancient times, thorns were common in the Middle Eastern landscape and often symbolized pain or trouble (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). A drunkard, impaired by alcohol, lacks the awareness to avoid or properly handle a thorn, leading to injury. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the dangers of drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) and the lack of wisdom and discernment it brings. The imagery suggests a lack of control and the inevitability of harm when one is not in a sober state of mind.<p><b>is a proverb in the mouth of a fool</b><br>A proverb, by nature, is a concise statement of wisdom or truth. However, when spoken by a fool&#8212;someone who lacks understanding or reverence for God (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>)&#8212;it loses its intended value and impact. The fool may repeat wise sayings without grasping their meaning, much like a drunkard who cannot feel the thorn. This reflects the biblical principle that wisdom is not merely about knowing words but understanding and applying them (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). The fool's misuse of proverbs can lead to misunderstanding or misapplication, highlighting the importance of wisdom and discernment in speech (<a href="/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fool.htm">Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a fool is someone who rejects wisdom and instruction, often characterized by a lack of moral and spiritual insight.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/drunkard.htm">Drunkard</a></b><br>A person impaired by alcohol, symbolizing a lack of control and awareness, which parallels the fool's misuse of wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorn.htm">Thorn</a></b><br>A sharp object that can cause pain or injury, symbolizing the potential harm of misused wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverb.htm">Proverb</a></b><br>A short, wise saying that conveys truth or advice, intended to guide behavior and decision-making.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_misuse_of_wisdom.htm">The Misuse of Wisdom</a></b><br>Just as a thorn can cause harm when mishandled, wisdom in the mouth of a fool can lead to misunderstanding and damage.

So it is best to render, "A thornbush cometh into the hand of a drunkard;" he somehow gets possession of it, and in his stupid excitement is liable to become dangerous. Some understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> of the growth of the thorn; thus the Septuagint, "Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard;" Vulgate, "As if a thorn grew in the hand of a drunkard." But one does not see the bearing of such an expression; and the translation given above is more appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable,</span> etc. (as ver. 7). In that passage the wise saying in a fool's mouth was compared with something useless, here it is compared with something injurious. He employs it purposely to wound others; or by the ignorant use of some sharp-edged word he does much mischief. In this hemistich the LXX. has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;</span> with a different vocalization, and renders, "servitude (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in the hand of fools." This seems to mean that it comes natural to fools to be manacled and restrained by force. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/26-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Like] a thorn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1453;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2336.htm">Strong's 2336: </a> </span><span class="str2">Briar, bramble, hook, ring, fetter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[that] falls</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into the hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;ya&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a drunkard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ik&#183;k&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7910.htm">Strong's 7910: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intoxicated, as a, state, a habit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a proverb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4912.htm">Strong's 4912: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pithy maxim, a simile</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the mouth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a fool.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;s&#238;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/26-9.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 26:9 Like a thornbush that goes into (Prov.
