In ancient Israelite society, the family unit was foundational, and respect for parents was paramount. Assaulting a father would not only be a personal sin but also a societal offense, undermining the family structure. The Hebrew culture placed great emphasis on filial piety, and such an act would be seen as a direct rebellion against God's ordained order.<p><b>or evicts his mother</b><br>Evicting one's mother would be considered an egregious act of disrespect and neglect. In the historical context, widows and elderly women were particularly vulnerable, and the law provided specific protections for them (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>). The act of eviction would leave a mother destitute and unprotected, violating the biblical mandate to care for one's family (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of compassion and responsibility towards one's parents, reflecting God's care for the marginalized.<p><b>is a son who brings shame and disgrace</b><br>In the cultural context of the Bible, honor and shame were significant social values. A son who mistreated his parents would not only bring personal shame but also disgrace his entire family. Proverbs often contrasts the wise and the foolish, and this behavior is clearly aligned with folly. The shame brought upon the family would have communal implications, affecting social standing and relationships. This phrase serves as a warning and a call to uphold family honor, aligning with the broader biblical theme of living righteously and justly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>Represents the paternal figure in a family, often seen as a source of wisdom, guidance, and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother.htm">Mother</a></b><br>Represents the maternal figure, often associated with nurturing, care, and emotional support.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/son.htm">Son</a></b><br>In this context, the son is the one who acts shamefully by mistreating his parents, highlighting a breakdown in familial respect and duty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shame_and_disgrace.htm">Shame and Disgrace</a></b><br>The consequences of the son's actions, affecting not only the family but also the community's perception of the family unit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/family.htm">Family</a></b><br>The central unit in biblical teaching, representing the foundational structure of society and a reflection of God's relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_family_honor.htm">The Importance of Family Honor</a></b><br>The family is a God-ordained institution, and maintaining its honor is crucial for societal stability and personal blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disrespect.htm">Consequences of Disrespect</a></b><br>Disrespecting parents leads to shame and disgrace, not only for the individual but also for the family and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/biblical_mandate_to_honor_parents.htm">Biblical Mandate to Honor Parents</a></b><br>Honoring parents is a direct command from God, and obedience to this command reflects our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_reconciliation.htm">Restoration and Reconciliation</a></b><br>For those who have dishonored their parents, the Bible offers a path to repentance and reconciliation, emphasizing God's grace and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_parents_in_teaching_respect.htm">Role of Parents in Teaching Respect</a></b><br>Parents have a responsibility to teach their children respect and honor, modeling these values in their own lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_19_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 19:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_19_26_on_dishonoring_parents.htm">How does Proverbs 19:26 warn against dishonoring parents in today's society?
