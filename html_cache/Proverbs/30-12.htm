Biblically, this reflects the human tendency to justify oneself without acknowledging sin, reminiscent of the Pharisees in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>). The idea of being "pure in their own eyes" suggests a lack of true self-awareness and humility, contrasting with the biblical call to repentance and recognition of one's sinful nature (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). This self-deception is warned against throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>, which cautions against being wise in one's own eyes.<p><b>and yet unwashed of their filth.</b><br>Despite their self-perception, this generation remains spiritually unclean. The imagery of being "unwashed" connects to the Old Testament purification rituals, which were necessary for approaching God (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>). This phrase underscores the futility of self-righteousness without genuine repentance and cleansing, which in the New Testament is fulfilled through Christ's sacrifice (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The concept of filth here symbolizes sin and moral impurity, which can only be cleansed by divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>, where God promises to cleanse His people. This highlights the need for true spiritual renewal and the insufficiency of human efforts to attain righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known.
