In biblical context, "going astray" often refers to departing from God's path, leading to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>). The Hebrew word for "contrive" suggests intentional planning, indicating a deliberate choice to pursue wickedness. Historically, Israel faced numerous warnings against evil schemes, as seen in the prophets' rebukes (<a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>). The cultural backdrop of ancient Israel emphasized community and covenant faithfulness, making the act of contriving evil not just a personal sin but a communal threat. This phrase echoes the broader biblical theme that sin leads to separation from God, as seen in the fall of man (Genesis 3).<p><b>But those who plan goodness find loving devotion and faithfulness.</b><br>In contrast, this phrase underscores the blessings associated with pursuing righteousness. "Plan goodness" implies intentionality in doing what is right, aligning with the biblical call to love justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The terms "loving devotion" and "faithfulness" are often linked to God's covenantal love (hesed) and reliability, suggesting that those who pursue good align themselves with God's character and receive His favor. This reflects the promise found in <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3-4</a>, where trust in the Lord leads to His provision and care. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly embodied goodness and received the ultimate reward of resurrection and exaltation (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel valued loyalty and steadfast love, both in human relationships and in one's relationship with God, reinforcing the idea that goodness leads to divine and communal blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The outcome is certain: &#8220;The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, but the blameless in their walk are His delight&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-20.htm">Proverbs 11:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Going &#8220;astray&#8221; includes:<p>&#8211; Minds darkened to truth (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>).<p>&#8211; Hearts hardened to conviction (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p>&#8211; Paths that end in destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Even if such schemes appear successful for a season, God&#8217;s justice stands: &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.

The question is an emphatic mode of asserting the truth. They who meditate and practise evil (<a href="/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>) go astray from the right way - the way of life; their views are distorted, and they no longer see their proper course. Thus the remorseful voluptuary bemoans himself, "We have erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction; yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it" (Wisd. 5:6, etc.), Mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. God's blessing will rest upon them. The combination of "mercy and truth" is found in <a href="/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>; in Wisd. 3:9 and 4:15, and in <a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a> we have "grace and mercy" (see note on Proverbs 3:3, where the two words occur in connection; and comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>). The two graces in the text signify the love and mercy which God bestows on the righteous, and the truth and fidelity with which he keeps the promises which he has made. The Vulgate makes the two graces human, not Divine: "Mercy and truth procure blessings." The Septuagint renders, "The good devise mercy and truth." It adds a paraphrase not found in the Hebrew, "The devisers of evil know not mercy and faith; but alms and faith are with the devisers of good." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#8205;&#1469;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;l&#333;&#183;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those who contrive</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go astray?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8582.htm">Strong's 8582: </a> </span><span class="str2">To vacillate, reel, stray</span><br /><br /><span class="word">But those who plan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">goodness find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">loving devotion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1445;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;e&#183;se&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2617.htm">Strong's 2617: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kindness, piety, reproof, beauty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and truth.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1462;&#1437;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1462;&#1431;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(we&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;me&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_571.htm">Strong's 571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stability, certainty, truth, trustworthiness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:22 Don't they go astray who plot evil?
