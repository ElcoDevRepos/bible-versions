In the ancient Near East, summer was a time of abundance, and the ant's preparation during this season reflects wisdom in utilizing available resources. Biblically, this aligns with the principle of stewardship found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34-36</a>, where Joseph advises Pharaoh to store grain during the seven years of plenty. The ant's actions can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparedness, echoing Jesus' parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where readiness is crucial. The ant's industrious nature also mirrors the call to work diligently as unto the Lord, as stated in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>.<p><b>it gathers its food at harvest.</b><br>The gathering of food at harvest time underscores the importance of timing and seizing opportunities. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, harvest was a critical period, and failure to gather crops could lead to famine. This reflects the biblical theme of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, emphasizing the consequences of one's actions. The ant's behavior is a practical example of wisdom, contrasting with the sluggard's neglect, as described in <a href="/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9-11</a>. Spiritually, this can be related to the harvest of souls, as Jesus speaks of in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, urging believers to be active in God's work. The ant's diligence serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual vigilance and readiness for the final harvest at Christ's return, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ant.htm">The Ant</a></b><br>The ant is the primary subject in this verse, serving as a model of diligence and foresight.

Rather than reacting to need, it anticipates it. Compare Joseph&#8217;s counsel in <a href="/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34-36</a>, where grain is stored &#8220;during the seven years of abundance&#8221; to face coming famine.<p>&#8226;Summer is the season of ease, warmth, and plenty. Using times of abundance well honors the Creator who supplies them (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>).<p>&#8226;The verse highlights personal responsibility. While God promises care, He also calls His people to diligence (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226;Summer preparation points to spiritual readiness. Just as the ant stores food, believers are urged to &#8220;store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>), investing in eternal priorities while opportunity remains.<p>&#8226;Laziness squanders God-given moments. <a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a> warns, &#8220;He who gathers in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgrace.&#8221; Active stewardship aligns with wisdom literature&#8217;s wider call to industry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It gathers its food at harvest</b><p>&#8220;it gathers its food at harvest&#8221;<p>&#8226;Harvest time demands focused labor. The ant does not delay, mirroring Ruth&#8217;s gleaning diligence in <a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2-7</a>.<p>&#8226;Gathering implies persistence. The ant&#8217;s small size never excuses neglect; similarly, believers are urged, &#8220;Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226;Harvest scenes picture final accountability. Jesus speaks of a coming harvest where wheat and weeds are separated (<a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>). Storing now anticipates that future reckoning.<p>&#8226;The phrase stresses completion: work begun in summer is finished at harvest. <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> contrasts the diligent soul, &#8220;made rich,&#8221; with the sluggard&#8217;s empty craving. Faithful follow-through honors God and secures provision.<p>&#8226;The ant&#8217;s teamwork provides a communal example. <a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a> describes the wall rebuilt because &#8220;the people had a mind to work.&#8221; Collective effort reflects God&#8217;s design for His people to serve together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8</a> commends steady, forward-looking diligence. By preparing in seasons of plenty and gathering when the moment arrives, the ant models wise stewardship of God&#8217;s gifts. Scripture consistently praises such foresight, calling believers to combine trust in the Lord with energetic responsibility, knowing that present faithfulness yields future blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</span> It is this characteristic, combined with what has just been said, which gives point to the lesson the sluggard is to learn. The teacher, as it were, argues: If the ant, so insignificant a creature in the order of the animal kingdom, is so provident, how much more should you be - you, a man endued with superior intelligence, and with so many more resources at hand, and with greater advantages! If the ant, with none to urge, direct, or control her work, is so industrious, surely she provides an example at which you, the sluggard, should blush, since there is every external incentive to rouse you to action - your duty to the community, the urgent advice of your friends, and your dignity as a man. If she provides for the future, much more should you do so, and threw off your sloth. Objection has been taken to what is here stated of the provident habits of the ant in storing food, on the ground that it is carnivorous and passes the winter in a state of torpidity. That the ant does lay up stores for future use has, however, been the opinion of all ages. Thus Hesiod ('Days,' 14) speaks of the ant as harvesting the grain, calling it <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the provident." Virgil says ('Georg.,' 1, 186; cf. 'AEneid,' 4:4027) - <p><span class="foreign">"Veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum<br />Quum populant hiemis memores, tectoque repenunt."</span> So the ants, when they plunder a tall heap of corn, mindful of the winter, store it in their cave. The language of Horace ('Sat.,' 1:50, 32) might be a comment on our passage - <p><span class="accented">"Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris sicut<br />Ore trahit quodcunque potest, atque addit acervo,<br />Quem struit, haud ignara ac non incauta futuri,<br />Quae, simul universum contristat Aquarius annum<br />Non usquam prorepit, et illis utitur ante Quaesitis sapiens."</span><br /><br /><span class="accented">"For thus the little ant (to human lore<br />No mean example) forms her frugal store,<br />Gathered, with mighty toils, on every side,<br />Nor ignorant, nor careless to provide<br />For future want; yet when the stars appear<br />That darkly sadden the declining year,<br />No more she comes abroad, but wisely lives<br />On the fair store industrious summer gives."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Francis' Translation.</span>) The same provident character is noted in AEsop's fable, 'The Ant and the Grasshopper;' see also Aristotle ('Hist. Nat.,' 9:6). All objections on this subject appear to be based on insufficient data, and have been conclusively answered by recent observation. Apart from the remark of Buffon, that "the ants of tropical climates <span class="accented">lay up provisions</span>, and as they probably live the whole year, they submit themselves to regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe." The late Professor Darwin states of the agricultural ant of Texas, which in many features resembles the ant of Palestine, that it not only <span class="accented">stores its food</span>, but prepares the soil for the crops, keeps the ground free from weeds, and finally reaps the harvest (<span class="accented">Journal of Linnaean Society</span>, vol. 1, No. 21, p. 29). Canon Tristram also observes, "The language of the wise man is not only in accordance with the universal belief of his own time, but with the accurately ascertained facts of natural history. Contrary to its habits in colder climates, the ant is not there dormant through the winter; and among the tamerisks of the Dead Sea it may be seen, in January, actively engaged in collecting the aphides and saccharine exudations, in long flies passing and repassing up and down the trunk. Two of the most common species of the Holy Land (<span class="accented">Alta barbara</span>, the black ant, and <span class="accented">Alta structor</span>, the brown ant) are strictly seed feeders, and in summer lay up large stores of grain for winter use. These species are spread along the whole of the Mediterranean coasts, but are unknown in more northern climates. Hence writers who were ignorant of ants beyond those of their own countries have been presumptuous enough to deny the accuracy of Solomon's statement" ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 320). The Mishna, section 'Zeraim,' also contains a curious piece of legislation which bears testimony to the storing properties of the ant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">it prepares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its provisions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7717;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in summer;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(baq&#183;qa&#183;yi&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7019.htm">Strong's 7019: </a> </span><span class="str2">To awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it gathers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_103.htm">Strong's 103: </a> </span><span class="str2">To harvest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3978.htm">Strong's 3978: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eatable</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at harvest.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1437;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;aq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7105.htm">Strong's 7105: </a> </span><span class="str2">Severed, harvest, the crop, the time, the reaper, a limb</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-8.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:8 Provides her bread in the summer (Prov.
