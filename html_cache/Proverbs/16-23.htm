Wisdom in the heart suggests a deep, internalized understanding of God's principles. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which emphasizes guarding the heart as it is the wellspring of life. The wise man's heart is shaped by a reverence for God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<p><b>instructs his mouth</b><br>The concept of the heart instructing the mouth highlights the importance of internal wisdom guiding external speech. This reflects the biblical principle that words are a reflection of one's inner state, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." The wise man exercises self-control, a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), ensuring that his words are thoughtful and edifying.<p><b>and adds persuasiveness to his lips.</b><br>Persuasiveness here implies the ability to communicate effectively and influence others positively. This is not mere rhetoric but is rooted in truth and integrity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, where a gentle answer turns away wrath. The wise man's speech is seasoned with grace, as encouraged in <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>, making it both compelling and constructive. This reflects the character of Christ, who spoke with authority and grace, drawing people to His message of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_man.htm">Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents an individual who possesses wisdom, often characterized by a deep understanding and reverence for God.
