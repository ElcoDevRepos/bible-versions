In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings and leaders often relied on a council of wise men or elders to make informed decisions. The Bible frequently highlights the value of wisdom and counsel, as seen in the story of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, who rejected the advice of the elders and faced disastrous consequences (<a href="/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6-11</a>). The principle here is that human understanding is limited, and without the input of others, plans are more likely to falter. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that emphasizes humility and the acknowledgment of one's need for guidance, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourages believers to ask God for wisdom.<p><b>but with many advisers they succeed</b><br>The second part of the verse underscores the strength found in a multitude of counselors. In biblical times, a king's success often depended on the quality and quantity of his advisers. This principle is evident in the story of Joseph, who, as an adviser to Pharaoh, helped Egypt prepare for famine (<a href="/genesis/41-33.htm">Genesis 41:33-40</a>). The idea of seeking multiple perspectives is also reflected in the New Testament, where the early church made decisions collectively, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council. This phrase suggests that success is more likely when decisions are made with the input of many, reflecting the biblical value of community and collective wisdom. It also points to the ultimate wisdom found in Christ, who is described as the "Wonderful Counselor" (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), indicating that true success is rooted in divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

In the multitude of counsellors they are established (<a href="/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>). We read of "counsellors" as almost regular officials in the Hebrew court, as in modern kingdoms (see <a href="/1_chronicles/27-32.htm">1 Chronicles 27:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>; comp. <a href="/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>). There is, of course, the danger of secrets being divulged where counsellors are many; and there is Terence's maxim to fear, "Quot heroines, tot sententiae;" but, properly guarded and discreetly used, good counsel is above all price.
