In biblical times, the household was the center of economic and social life, and the woman played a crucial role in managing it. The Hebrew word for "watches over" implies a careful and attentive oversight, suggesting that she is both proactive and protective. This mirrors the role of a shepherd who guards and tends to the flock, ensuring their well-being. The concept of stewardship is central here, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given the responsibility to manage God's creation. The virtuous woman exemplifies this stewardship within her home, reflecting the order and care God desires for His people.<p><b>and does not eat the bread of idleness</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the woman's industrious nature. In the ancient Near Eastern context, bread was a staple of daily life, symbolizing sustenance and provision. To "eat the bread of idleness" would imply living off the labor of others without contributing oneself. The virtuous woman, however, is characterized by her active participation in the welfare of her family. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, which states, "If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat." Her diligence is a reflection of the wisdom literature's broader theme that hard work leads to prosperity and laziness to poverty, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>. This industriousness can also be seen as a type of Christ, who worked tirelessly for the spiritual nourishment and salvation of His people, as depicted in <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>, where Jesus speaks of doing the will of the Father as His sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing the virtues of a godly woman.

The verb calls up the picture of a sentinel, ready to act. Scripture consistently links spiritual maturity with watchfulness:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus urges, &#8220;What I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-37.htm">Mark 13:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes, &#8220;So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p>By keeping watch, she anticipates needs, spots dangers early, and steers her family in wisdom rather than reacting after damage is done.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>over the affairs</b><p>Her vigilance has direction. She is not a busybody but a manager who oversees the practical flow of life: schedules, resources, relationships, and spiritual tone. Biblical snapshots reinforce the value of purposeful oversight:<p>&#8226; &#8220;I want the younger widows to marry, bear children, and manage their households&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s servant could testify, &#8220;The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become rich&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-35.htm">Genesis 24:35</a>)&#8212;a reminder that wise stewardship welcomes God&#8217;s blessing.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of her household</b><p>Her first field of ministry is home. The verse does not confine her, but it clarifies priorities: her leadership begins with those under her roof.<p>&#8226; &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The wise woman builds her house&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul counsels women &#8220;to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, and busy at home&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4-5</a>).<p>The home becomes a platform for hospitality, discipleship, and gospel witness because she treats it as sacred ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and does not eat</b><p>The image turns from watching to personal discipline. She refuses indulgence that dulls effectiveness. Echoes resound throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; &#8220;If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul testifies, &#8220;I discipline my body and make it my slave&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>).<p>Her self-restraint frees time, energy, and resources for serving others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the bread of idleness</b><p>&#8220;Bread&#8221; suggests something taken in, even craved. Idleness, however, nourishes nothing and slowly erodes soul and household alike. Wisdom contrasts diligence and laziness:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Go to the ant, O sluggard&#8230; How long will you lie there?&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Because of laziness the roof caves in&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament urges believers to be &#8220;redeeming the time, because the days are evil&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>) and to &#8220;work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>Her refusal to snack on idleness keeps the house standing, needs met, and her spirit vibrant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a> paints a picture of an alert, intentional, disciplined woman whose first priority is the well-being of her home. She guards, guides, and gives herself to service rather than sloth. In doing so she reflects the character of the Lord who never sleeps, always provides, and calls His people to diligent love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - TSADE. <span class="cmt_word">She looketh well to the ways of her house;</span> the actions and habits of the household. She exercises careful surveillance over all that goes on in the family. <span class="cmt_word">Eateth not the bread of idleness;</span> but rather bread won by active labour and conscientious diligence. She is of the opinion of the apostle who said "that if any would not work, neither should he eat" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>). Septuagint, "The ways of her house are confined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), and she eats not idle bread." The first of these clauses may mean that the proceedings of her household, being confined to a narrow circle, are readily supervised. But the meaning is very doubtful; and Schleusner renders, "continuae conversationes in aedibus ejus." St. Gregory applies our verse to the conscience, thus: "She considers the ways of her house, because she accurately examines all the thoughts of her conscience. She eateth not her bread in idleness, because that which she learned out of Holy Scripture by her understanding, she places before the eyes of the Judge by exhibiting it in her works" ('Moral.,' 35:47). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She watches over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1453;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6822.htm">Strong's 6822: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lean forward, to peer into the distance, to observe, await</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the affairs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1979.htm">Strong's 1979: </a> </span><span class="str2">A walking, a procession, march, a caravan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of her household</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1445;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of idleness.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1437;&#1510;&#1456;&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7779;&#183;l&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6104.htm">Strong's 6104: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sluggishness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:27 She looks well to the ways (Prov.
