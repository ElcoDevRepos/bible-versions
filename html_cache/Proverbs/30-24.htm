The number four often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting a comprehensive lesson from creation. The focus on "earth" highlights the tangible, observable world, inviting readers to learn from God's creation. This aligns with the biblical theme that nature reveals God's wisdom and order (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>).<p><b>are small</b><br>The emphasis on smallness contrasts with the wisdom these creatures possess. In biblical terms, God often uses the small and seemingly insignificant to demonstrate His power and wisdom, as seen in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17). This reflects the biblical principle that God values humility and can use the humble to achieve His purposes (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>yet they are exceedingly wise</b><br>The wisdom of these creatures is described as "exceeding," suggesting a wisdom that surpasses human expectations. This wisdom is not based on size or strength but on God-given instincts and behaviors. The Bible frequently associates true wisdom with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), indicating that wisdom is a divine gift rather than a human achievement.
