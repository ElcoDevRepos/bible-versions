Wisdom in the biblical context is not merely intellectual knowledge but a deep understanding and application of God's principles in daily life. The joy brought to the father signifies the pride and satisfaction a parent feels when their child chooses a path of righteousness and discernment. This reflects the cultural importance of family honor in ancient Israel, where a child's actions could significantly impact the family's reputation. The father-son relationship here can also be seen as a metaphor for the relationship between God and His followers, where God, as the Father, delights in His children who seek and apply His wisdom. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, which also highlights the joy a wise child brings to their parents.<p><b>but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the previous statement by illustrating the consequences of foolishness and moral failure. In ancient Israel, associating with prostitutes was not only a moral failing but also a financial one, as it often led to the squandering of resources. The term "companion of prostitutes" suggests a lifestyle of indulgence and lack of self-control, which is condemned throughout Proverbs (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-10</a>). This behavior leads to the loss of wealth, both materially and spiritually, as it diverts one's resources and focus away from productive and godly pursuits. The prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a> serves as a New Testament parallel, where the son's reckless living leads to his downfall. This phrase warns against the dangers of succumbing to temptations that lead one away from the path of wisdom and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_son.htm">The Wise Son</a></b><br>Represents an individual who seeks and values wisdom, bringing joy and honor to his family, particularly his father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Symbolizes the family and community that benefits from the wise actions and decisions of the son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_companion_of_prostitutes.htm">The Companion of Prostitutes</a></b><br>Represents someone who engages in foolish and immoral behavior, leading to personal and financial ruin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitutes.htm">Prostitutes</a></b><br>In this context, they symbolize temptations and distractions that lead one away from wisdom and righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth.htm">Wealth</a></b><br>Not just material wealth, but also spiritual and relational wealth that can be squandered through foolish living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_wisdom.htm">Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of seeking wisdom as a means to bring joy and honor to one's family and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_foolishness.htm">Consequences of Foolishness</a></b><br>Highlight the dangers of engaging in immoral behavior and the potential for financial and spiritual ruin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/parental_joy.htm">Parental Joy</a></b><br>Discuss the impact of a child's wise choices on their parents and the broader community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_temptation.htm">Guarding Against Temptation</a></b><br>Encourage vigilance in avoiding temptations that lead away from a life of wisdom and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_wealth.htm">Stewardship of Wealth</a></b><br>Teach the importance of managing both material and spiritual wealth wisely, avoiding wasteful and sinful behaviors.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_29_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 29:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_29_3_Wisdom_vs_Foolishness.htm">How does Proverbs 29:3 encourage valuing wisdom over foolishness in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_29_3_Effects_of_such_company.htm">What are the consequences of associating with "prostitutes" as mentioned in Proverbs 29:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Proverbs_29_3_13_20_on_friends.htm">How does Proverbs 29:3 connect with Proverbs 13:20 on choosing companions wisely?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_bring_joy_to_our_parents.htm">In what ways can we "bring joy" to our parents today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_29_3_in_today_s_relationships.htm">How can we apply Proverbs 29:3 to modern relationships and friendships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_29_3_on_wisdom_family_impact.htm">How does Proverbs 29:3 define wisdom and its impact on family relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Cultural_influences_on_Proverbs_29_3.htm">What cultural context influenced the writing of Proverbs 29:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_29_3_and_today_s_morality.htm">How does Proverbs 29:3 relate to modern views on morality and lifestyle choices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_29.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_godly_parenting_in_the_bible.htm">What does the Bible say about godly parenting?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_rebellious_kids.htm">What does the Bible say about rebellious children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_proverbs_4_1_ignore_bad_guidance.htm">Does the call to heed a father's instruction in Proverbs 4:1 ignore the possibility of flawed or harmful parental guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_god's_chastening.htm">What does God chastening His children mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Proverbs 29:3 Mean</div><b>A man who loves wisdom</b><p>&#8220;Wisdom is supreme; acquire wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).
