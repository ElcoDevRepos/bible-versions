In ancient times, hunting was a vital means of sustenance, and failing to roast game would mean wasting valuable resources. The imagery suggests that a lazy person fails to complete tasks, leading to loss and unfulfilled potential. Biblically, laziness is often contrasted with diligence (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>). The failure to roast game can symbolize spiritual negligence, where one does not cultivate or utilize the blessings and opportunities God provides. This can be connected to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where the servant who did nothing with his talent was reprimanded.<p><b>but a diligent man prizes his possession</b><br>Diligence is portrayed as a virtue that leads to prosperity and fulfillment. The diligent man values and makes the most of what he has, reflecting a responsible and grateful attitude. This aligns with the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are called to manage their resources wisely (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>). The term "prizes his possession" suggests an appreciation and careful management of one's resources, talents, and opportunities. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who diligently fulfilled His mission on earth, valuing the "possession" of His people and the work given to Him by the Father (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>). The diligent man's attitude is a model for believers to emulate, encouraging them to be faithful in their responsibilities and to honor God with their efforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazy_man.htm">Lazy Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who lack motivation and discipline, failing to complete tasks or make the most of their resources.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/diligent_man.htm">Diligent Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who are industrious, responsible, and value their resources, ensuring they are used wisely.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/game.htm">Game</a></b><br>Refers to the resources or opportunities available to a person, which require effort to be fully utilized.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/possession.htm">Possession</a></b><br>Denotes the outcomes or benefits that result from diligent work and careful stewardship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_laziness.htm">The Consequences of Laziness</a></b><br>Laziness leads to missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.

It seems to be a proverbial saying, implying either that a lazy man will not take the trouble to hunt, or, if he does hunt, will not prepare the food which he has taken in the chase, or that he does not enjoy it when he has gotten it. Others render, "will not start his prey;" or "catch his prey," Septuagint; or "secure his prey," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will not keep in his net what he has caught, but carelessly lets it escape. The Vulgate renders, "The cheat will gain no profit." The word rendered "cheat," <span class="accented">fraudulentus</span> in the Latin, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Greek, is the same as that rightly translated "slothful" (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">But the substance of a diligent man is precious;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>the substance which an honest, industrious man acquires by his labour is stable and of real value.

The Authorized Version is probably erroneous, and the rendering should be, as Delitzsch and Nowack take it, "But a precious possession of a man is diligence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/12-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A lazy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;m&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7423.htm">Strong's 7423: </a> </span><span class="str2">Remissness, treachery</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">roast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2760.htm">Strong's 2760: </a> </span><span class="str2">To braid, catch, in a, net</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his game,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1461;&#1497;&#1491;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6718.htm">Strong's 6718: </a> </span><span class="str2">The chase, game, lunch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a diligent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2742.htm">Strong's 2742: </a> </span><span class="str2">Incised, incisive, a trench, gold, a threshing-sledge, determination, eager</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prizes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;q&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3368.htm">Strong's 3368: </a> </span><span class="str2">Precious, rare, splendid, weighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his possession.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;wn-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1952.htm">Strong's 1952: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wealth, sufficiency</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/12-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 12:27 The slothful man doesn't roast his game (Prov.
