A wise servant was one who demonstrated discernment, loyalty, and the ability to manage affairs prudently. This wisdom is not merely intellectual but also moral and spiritual, aligning with the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The delight of the king in such a servant reflects the biblical principle that those who serve well are honored (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>). This can be seen in the story of Joseph, who, through his wisdom and integrity, gained favor with Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>). The king's delight also prefigures the pleasure of God in His faithful servants, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<p><b>but his anger falls on the shameful</b><br>The shameful servant is one who acts foolishly, bringing disgrace upon himself and potentially causing harm to the king's reputation and kingdom. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, honor and shame were significant social values. A servant's shameful behavior could lead to severe consequences, including punishment or dismissal. This reflects the biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The anger of the king is not arbitrary but a response to the servant's failure to fulfill his duties. This mirrors God's righteous anger towards sin and unfaithfulness (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). The contrast between the wise and shameful servant also points to the ultimate judgment where Christ, the King of Kings, will separate the faithful from the unfaithful (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents authority and leadership.

Throughout Scripture, earthly rulers are portrayed as God&#8217;s delegated ministers of order (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>). When we read &#8220;king,&#8221; we can apply the principle to any leader&#8212;parents, employers, pastors, government officials&#8212;because authority structures all flow from God&#8217;s design (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). Taking the statement at face value, we are reminded that rulers do not govern in a moral vacuum; their reactions&#8212;whether delight or anger&#8212;are bound to the character of those under them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Delights in a wise servant</b><p>God describes wisdom as the skill of living in healthy respect of Him (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>). A servant who consistently acts with discernment, integrity, and diligence becomes a joy to his leader. Consider:<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s rise under Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-41</a>)<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s favor with multiple kings (<a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a>)<p>&#8226; The faithful steward Jesus commends: &#8220;Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has put in charge&#8230;? Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45-46</a>)<p>Such examples show why Proverbs elsewhere says, &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>). Wisdom and competence invite promotion, trust, and genuine delight from those in command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But his anger falls on the shameful</b><p>The flip side is sobering. &#8220;Shameful&#8221; points to behavior that disgraces both the servant and the master&#8212;laziness, deceit, rebellion (<a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-18.htm">Proverbs 13:18</a>). Scripture repeatedly warns that rulers wield real, God-sanctioned power to punish wrongdoing (<a href="/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). Notice how:<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s disobedience cost him his throne (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>)<p>&#8226; The unfaithful steward in Jesus&#8217; parable was &#8220;cut in pieces and assigned a place with the hypocrites&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>)<p>&#8226; Haman&#8217;s treachery provoked King Xerxes&#8217; wrath and led to his own execution (<a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7-10</a>)<p>A leader&#8217;s anger is not arbitrary&#8212;it &#8220;falls&#8221; in direct response to conduct that brings reproach. The verse underscores an unchanging moral order: wisdom brings favor; shame invites judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/14-35.htm">Proverbs 14:35</a> teaches a clear cause-and-effect reality. Those under authority who walk in godly wisdom become a pleasure to their leaders and enjoy blessing. Those who act disgracefully provoke rightful anger and experience painful consequences. Whether in the throne room, the office, or the home, the principle holds: seek wisdom, serve well, and you will bring joy both to earthly leaders and to the ultimate King who ordained them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's favour is toward a wise servant;</span> <span class="accented">servant that dealeth wisely</span> (Revised Version).
