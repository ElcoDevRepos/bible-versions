In ancient Israel, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet this proverb warns against the deception of outward appearances. The Hebrew culture placed significant value on community and reputation, which could lead individuals to project an image of wealth to gain social standing or influence. This aligns with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He warns against storing up treasures on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The idea of pretending to be rich can also be linked to spiritual poverty, where one may appear to have everything but lacks true spiritual fulfillment and connection with God.<p><b>another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.</b><br>This part of the proverb contrasts the first by illustrating that true wealth is not always visible. In biblical times, humility and modesty were virtues, and this phrase suggests that those who downplay their material wealth may possess greater spiritual or moral riches. This can be seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who, though He was rich, became poor for our sake (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). The concept of hidden wealth can also be connected to the treasures of wisdom and knowledge found in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). Historically, figures like King Solomon, who authored many proverbs, were known for their wisdom and understanding, which were considered more valuable than gold or silver. This phrase encourages readers to seek true wealth in wisdom, righteousness, and a relationship with God, rather than in material possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom and wealth.

God does not fault wealth itself (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>), but He opposes a heart that seeks identity or security in possessions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but has nothing</b><p>&#8226; Behind the wealthy fa&#231;ade lies emptiness&#8212;no savings, no peace, no eternal treasure. <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a> captures the irony: &#8220;You say, &#8216;I am rich...&#8217; Yet you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Temporal riches can evaporate overnight (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>). Without Christ, even the wealthiest life ends in spiritual bankruptcy (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; True prosperity starts with fearing the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>), not with stacking up things that cannot follow us beyond the grave (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another pretends to be poor</b><p>&#8226; Now the proverb flips the coin, showing someone who downplays or conceals abundance.

A life built on showcasing riches can leave a person destitute where it matters most, while a life marked by humble faith and stewardship can possess immeasurable wealth in God&#8217;s sight.

There are some who pretend to be rich while really they are poor (as <a href="/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a>), and there are some who make themselves, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pretend to be poor (as misers) while they have much wealth. The Vulgate elucidates this meaning by rendering, <span class="accented">quasi dives</span> and <span class="accented">quasi pauper</span>; and the Hebrew verbs confirm its correctness. The proverb in both members teaches one not to trust to appearances. Septuagint, "There are who enrich themselves, having nothing; and there are who humble themselves amid much wealth." It is obvious that such a version lends itself to a Christian interpretation. The first clause reminds one of the rich fool who laid up treasure for himself, and was not rich toward God (<a href="/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>). The second clause teaches that wealth expended in God's service makes a man rich in the treasury of heaven (<a href="/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21, 33</a>). One who thus uses the means entrusted to him could be spoken of like St. Paul, "as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things" (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One pretends to be rich,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1453;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6238.htm">Strong's 6238: </a> </span><span class="str2">To accumulate, chiefly, to grow, rich</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but has nothing;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another pretends to be poor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1437;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7326.htm">Strong's 7326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in want or poor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yet has great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wealth.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1952.htm">Strong's 1952: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wealth, sufficiency</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/13-7.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 13:7 There are some who pretend to be (Prov.
