The principle of sowing and reaping is evident here, where giving leads to greater blessings. This concept is echoed in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where Jesus teaches that giving will result in receiving a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The cultural context of ancient Israel valued community and mutual support, and this principle would have been understood as a divine promise of provision. The act of giving freely reflects God's own nature, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God gave His only Son. This phrase also connects to the idea of spiritual wealth, where the giver gains not just materially but also in spiritual richness and favor with God.<p><b>another withholds what is right, only to become poor.</b><br>This part of the verse warns against the consequences of selfishness and hoarding. In the historical context, withholding what is right could refer to not paying fair wages or not providing for the needy, actions condemned in passages like <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-5</a>. The cultural expectation was to care for the poor and the stranger, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>. The phrase suggests that such withholding leads to poverty, not just materially but also spiritually and relationally. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wealth is found in generosity and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-7</a>, where Paul encourages cheerful giving. The warning serves as a reminder that God's blessings are tied to our willingness to share with others, reflecting the selfless love of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
