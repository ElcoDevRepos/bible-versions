In the biblical context, "gain" refers to the fruits of her labor, which are both material and spiritual. The Hebrew word for "gain" can also imply profit or merchandise, suggesting that her efforts in managing her household and business ventures are successful and beneficial. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, "In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty." The virtuous woman is diligent and industrious, reflecting the biblical ideal of hard work leading to prosperity. Her ability to recognize the value of her work is a testament to her wisdom and understanding, qualities that are praised throughout the book of Proverbs.<p><b>and her lamp is not extinguished at night</b><br>This phrase symbolizes her tireless dedication and vigilance. In ancient times, a lamp burning at night was a sign of watchfulness and readiness. The imagery of a lamp is often used in Scripture to represent guidance, truth, and the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The virtuous woman's lamp not being extinguished signifies her continuous care for her household and her preparedness to meet any needs that arise. It also reflects her spiritual alertness and commitment to maintaining the light of God's wisdom in her life. This perpetual light can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), indicating that her life is a reflection of His light and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing wisdom, diligence, and virtue.

The text stresses at least three realities:<p>&#8226; Productive diligence. Previous verses describe her buying a field and planting a vineyard (31:16), spinning wool and flax (31:13), and selling garments (31:24). Hard work brings tangible profit, echoing <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, &#8220;There is profit in all hard work.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Discernment.

Profit is acknowledged as good because &#8220;the blessing of the LORD enriches&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>).

The picture is both practical and symbolic.<p>&#8226; Faithful care after hours. In a world without electricity, a burning lamp meant safety, warmth, and welcome. She stays available until tasks are finished, reminiscent of Ruth gleaning &#8220;until evening&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Readiness.

The verse calls every believer to diligent labor, honest self-assessment, gratitude for God&#8217;s blessing, and unwavering readiness that keeps the light of witness shining through even the darkest hours.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - TETH. <span class="cmt_word">She perceiveth that her merchandise is good</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Gustavit et vidit quia bona est negotiatio ejus</span>, where the paraphrase, "she tastes and sees," expresses the meaning of the verb <span class="accented">taam</span> here used. Her prudence and economy leave her a large surplus profit, which she contemplates with satisfaction. There is no suspicion of arrogance or conceit, The pleasure that is derived from duty done and successfully conducted business is legitimate and healthy, a providential reward of good works. Septuagint, "She tastes that it is good to work." This comfort and success spur her on to further and more continued exertion. <span class="cmt_word">Her candle</span> (<span class="accented">lamp</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>goeth not out by night</span>. She is not idle even when night falls, and outdoor occupations are cut short; she finds work for the hours of darkness, such as is mentioned in the next verse. One recalls Virgil's picture of the thrifty housewife ('AEneid,' 8:407) - <p><span class="foreign">"Inde ubi prima quies medio jam noctis abactae<br />Curriculo expulerat somnum, cum femina primum,<br />Cui tolerare colo vitam tenuique Minerva <br />Impositum, cinerem et sopitos suscitat ignis,<br />Noctem addens operi, famulesque ad lumina longo<br />Exercet penso."</span> Some take the lamp here in an allegorical sense, as signifying life, happiness, and prosperity, as <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a> and Proverbs 20:20; others, as denoting a bright example of diligence and piety (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). But the simple meaning seems to be the one intended. Wordsworth notes that the passage in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which speaks of the "merchandise" of the false Church, also affirms that "the light of a candle" shall shine in her no more, the two metaphors in our passage applied to the true Church being there applied to Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She sees</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1453;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2938.htm">Strong's 2938: </a> </span><span class="str2">To taste, to perceive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her gain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(sa&#7717;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5504.htm">Strong's 5504: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commerce, gain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] good,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and her lamp</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5216.htm">Strong's 5216: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamp, light</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">extinguished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7733;&#183;beh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3518.htm">Strong's 3518: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be quenched or extinguished, to go out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at night.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;al&#183;lay&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3915.htm">Strong's 3915: </a> </span><span class="str2">A twist, night, adversity</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-18.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable (Prov.
