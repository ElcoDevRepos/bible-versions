In the cultural context of ancient Israel, personal vendettas and retribution were common, yet the wisdom literature consistently advises against such actions. The principle here aligns with the broader biblical teaching found in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which instructs, "Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself." This reflects the heart of God's law, emphasizing mercy over vengeance. Jesus Christ further expounds on this in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>, where He teaches to turn the other cheek, promoting forgiveness and grace over retaliation.<p><b>I will repay the man according to his work.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the concept of personal justice, which is discouraged in favor of leaving judgment to God. <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> echoes this sentiment, stating, "Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God&#8217;s wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord." The historical context of this teaching is rooted in the understanding that God is the ultimate judge and arbiter of justice. By refraining from personal retribution, believers demonstrate trust in God's sovereign justice. This principle is also a type of Christ, who, despite suffering unjustly, did not retaliate but entrusted Himself to the One who judges justly (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). This reflects the call for Christians to follow Christ's example of forgiveness and reliance on God's righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker</a></b><br>The individual being addressed in this proverb, who is tempted to seek revenge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbor.htm">The Neighbor</a></b><br>The person who has wronged the speaker, prompting thoughts of retaliation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, offering wisdom and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which these proverbs were written, emphasizing community and justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_retaliation.htm">The Act of Retaliation</a></b><br>The event or action being discouraged in this verse, highlighting the human tendency towards revenge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/rejecting_retaliation.htm">Rejecting Retaliation</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to resist the natural urge to repay wrongs with wrongs.
