In biblical times, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and trust. Eating with someone implied a bond of friendship and mutual respect. However, a stingy person may offer food with ulterior motives, lacking genuine generosity. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of discerning the intentions behind actions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/23-7.htm">Proverbs 23:7</a>, which suggests that a person's true thoughts may not align with their outward actions. The cultural context emphasizes the importance of sincerity and integrity in relationships, warning against superficial or self-serving interactions.<p><b>and do not crave his delicacies;</b><br>This part of the verse advises against desiring the luxurious offerings of a person who is not truly generous. The term "delicacies" refers to rich, sumptuous foods that might be tempting but come with strings attached. In the ancient Near East, such foods were often associated with wealth and status. The warning here is to avoid being enticed by material wealth or superficial allure, which can lead to compromising one's values or becoming indebted to someone with selfish intentions. This echoes the biblical theme of contentment and the dangers of covetousness, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>, which cautions against the love of money and the pursuit of riches. The verse encourages believers to seek sustenance and satisfaction in God rather than in the fleeting pleasures offered by those with impure motives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stingy_man.htm">Stingy Man</a></b><br>This refers to a person who is miserly or selfish, unwilling to share their resources freely. The Hebrew word used here is "ra&#8216;" which can imply someone with an evil or begrudging eye, indicating a deeper issue of the heart.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_and_delicacies.htm">Bread and Delicacies</a></b><br>These represent the material offerings or hospitality extended by the stingy man.
