The "terror" of a king refers to the fear and respect that his authority commanded. This is reminiscent of the divine right of kings, where the monarch was seen as God's representative on earth. In biblical context, kings like David and Solomon were seen as shepherds of their people, but they also had the power to enforce laws and administer justice, which could instill fear. This phrase underscores the importance of respecting authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, where Paul emphasizes submission to governing authorities as they are instituted by God.<p><b>is like the roar of a lion;</b><br>The lion is often used in the Bible as a symbol of strength, power, and majesty. In the ancient Near East, lions were considered the kings of the animal kingdom, much like the king was the supreme ruler among men. The roar of a lion is a powerful and fearsome sound, symbolizing the king's ability to instill fear and command respect. This imagery is also used in <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, where the prophet speaks of the Lord's voice as a lion's roar, indicating the power and authority of God's word. The comparison suggests that just as a lion's roar can paralyze its prey with fear, so too can the king's wrath be overwhelming and inescapable.<p><b>whoever provokes him forfeits his own life.</b><br>Provoking a king was a serious offense, often leading to severe consequences, including death. In the historical context of monarchies, the king's word was law, and any challenge to his authority could be seen as rebellion or treason. This phrase highlights the potential danger of inciting the king's anger, as seen in the story of Esther, where approaching the king without being summoned could result in death (<a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>). It also reflects the broader biblical principle of sowing and reaping, where actions have consequences, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. This serves as a warning to exercise wisdom and caution in dealings with those in authority, recognizing the potential risks of defiance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents authority and power, often seen as God's appointed ruler on earth.
