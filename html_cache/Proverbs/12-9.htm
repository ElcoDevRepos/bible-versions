In ancient Israel, having a servant indicated a certain level of wealth and stability. The cultural context suggests that being "lightly esteemed" refers to not seeking or receiving high social recognition or honor. The Bible often highlights humility as a virtue, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up." The presence of a servant implies that one's basic needs are met, which is more valuable than mere reputation.<p><b>than to be self-important but lack food</b><br>This part contrasts the previous phrase by highlighting the folly of pride and self-importance when it leads to a lack of basic necessities. In biblical times, food scarcity was a significant concern, and lacking food would indicate poverty or mismanagement. The warning against pride is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The emphasis is on the practical over the superficial, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>, where He advises seeking God's kingdom over worrying about material needs. This phrase serves as a reminder that true wisdom values substance over appearance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

God honors humility, provides for the content, and brings low those who chase image at the expense of reality.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He that is despised.</span>--That is, lowly in his eyes and those of others, as David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-23.htm" title="And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?">1Samuel 18:23</a>); if "he hath a servant," that is, if he be in easy circumstances. It has been remarked that "the first necessity of an Oriental in only moderate circumstances is a slave."<p><span class= "bld">He that honoureth himself.</span>--Boasts of his pedigree, it may be, and is all the while starving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse may be translated, <span class="accented">Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and hath a slave, than he that boasts himself and lacketh bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who is thought little of by his fellows, and is lowly in his own eyes, if he have a slave to minister to his wants (which all Orientals of even moderate wealth possess), is better off than one who boasts of his rank and family, and is all the while on the verge of starvation. "Respectful mediocrity is better than boastful poverty." Ecclus. 10:27, "Better is he that laboreth and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread." But the words rendered, <span class="cmt_word">hath a slave,</span> are literally, <span class="accented">a servant to himself.</span> So the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">sufficiens sibi</span>, "sufficing himself," and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "serving himself." And the expression implies attending to his own concerns, supplying his own wants. Hence the gnome means, "It is wiser to look after one's own business and provide for one's own necessities, even if thereby he meets with contempt and detraction, than to be in real want, and all the time assuming the airs of a rich and prosperous man." This latter explanation seems most suitable, as it is not at all clear that, at the time the book was written, the Israelites of moderate fortune kept slaves, and the proverb would lose its force if they did not do so.
