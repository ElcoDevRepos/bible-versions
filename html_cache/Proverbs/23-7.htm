In biblical context, this can be compared to the Pharisees, who were often criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). The idea of "counting the cost" also echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a>, where He advises considering the cost of discipleship. This phrase warns against superficial generosity that masks ulterior motives, a theme consistent with the wisdom literature's emphasis on discerning true intentions.<p><b>&#8220;Eat and drink,&#8221; he says to you</b><br>This phrase reflects a common cultural practice of hospitality in ancient Near Eastern societies, where sharing a meal was a sign of friendship and alliance. However, the insincerity behind the invitation is highlighted here. In the broader biblical narrative, meals often symbolize fellowship and covenant (e.g., the Last Supper in <a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>). The duplicity in this invitation contrasts with the genuine fellowship that God desires with His people, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, offering true communion.<p><b>but his heart is not with you</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. This phrase underscores the disconnect between outward actions and inner intentions. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> speaks to the deceitfulness of the heart, emphasizing the need for discernment. The lack of genuine intent here serves as a warning against trusting appearances. In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of the heart's condition in <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>, where He teaches that what comes from the heart defiles a person.

In the Authorized Version the word "heart" occurs twice in this verse, but the Hebrew words are different. The first is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "breath," equivalent to "mind;" the second is <span class="accented">leb</span>, "heart." The Vulgate paraphrases the clause, <span class="accented">Quoniam in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris, aestimat quod ignorat</span>, "For like a soothsayer or diviner he conjectures that of which he is ignorant." <span class="cmt_word">Eat and drink, saith he to thee.</span> He professes to make you welcome, and with seeming cordiality invites you to partake of the food upon his table. <span class="cmt_word">But his heart is not with thee.</span> He is not glad to see you enjoy yourself, and his pressing invitation is empty verbiage with no heart in it. The Septuagint, pointing differently, translates, "For as if one should swallow a hair, so he eats and drinks." The Greek translators take the gnome to apply to one who invites an envious man to his table, and finds him eating his food as if it disgusted him. They go on, "Bring him not in to thee, nor eat thy morsel with him; for (ver. 8) he will vomit it up, and outrage thy fair words." In agreement with the gnome above, we find in the Talmud, "My son, eat not the bread of the covetous, nor sit thou at his table. The bread of the covetous is only pain and anguish; the bread of the generous man is a source of health and joy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/23-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;
