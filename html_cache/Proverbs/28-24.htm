In ancient Israel, family was the cornerstone of society, and respect for parents was paramount. Robbing one's parents not only signifies a breach of familial duty but also a disruption of social order. The act of robbing parents could involve financial theft or neglecting to provide for them in their old age, which was a cultural expectation. This behavior reflects a heart hardened against the natural affection and duty owed to one's parents.<p><b>saying, &#8220;It is not wrong,&#8221;</b><br>This self-justification indicates a seared conscience and a rejection of moral absolutes. In biblical terms, calling evil good and good evil is condemned (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The individual rationalizes their sin, perhaps by claiming entitlement or necessity, reflecting a deeper spiritual blindness. This attitude is reminiscent of the deceitfulness of sin described in <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>, where the heart becomes hardened through the deceit of sin.<p><b>is a companion to the man who destroys</b><br>The term "companion" suggests alignment or partnership with those who cause ruin. In biblical context, destruction is often associated with the wicked (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). This phrase implies that those who justify their wrongdoing are akin to those who actively seek to harm and destroy. The "man who destroys" can be seen as a type of Satan, who is described as a thief who comes to steal, kill, and destroy (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). This connection underscores the gravity of the sin and its alignment with evil forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son/daughter.htm">The Son/Daughter</a></b><br>The individual who is taking from their parents, justifying their actions as not being wrong.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_mother.htm">Father and Mother</a></b><br>The parents who are being wronged by their child, representing authority and provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_companion.htm">The Companion</a></b><br>The person who is likened to a destroyer, indicating the moral and spiritual decay associated with such actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>A metaphorical figure representing chaos, harm, and moral corruption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_honoring_parents.htm">The Importance of Honoring Parents</a></b><br>The Bible consistently teaches the value of respecting and honoring one's parents.
