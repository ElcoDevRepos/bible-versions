They are mentioned in the Bible as unclean animals (<a href="/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>) due to their chewing cud but not having split hooves. Despite their small size, they are noted for their wisdom in seeking refuge in the rocks, a behavior that provides them protection from predators.<p><b>are creatures of little power</b><br>This phrase highlights the physical vulnerability of rock badgers. They lack the strength and defenses of larger animals, making them seemingly insignificant in the animal kingdom. This can be seen as a metaphor for human weakness and the need for reliance on God&#8217;s strength. The Bible often emphasizes that God uses the weak to confound the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), illustrating that true power comes from God rather than physical might.<p><b>yet they make their homes in the rocks;</b><br>The rock badgers' choice to dwell in the rocks is a strategic one, providing them with safety and security. In biblical symbolism, rocks often represent strength, stability, and refuge. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to describe God as a rock and fortress (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2, 31</a>:3). The rock badgers' wisdom in choosing such a dwelling place serves as a lesson in seeking refuge in God, who is the ultimate source of protection and security. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the cornerstone and the rock of salvation (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rock_badgers.htm">Rock Badgers (Hyraxes)</a></b><br>Small, herbivorous mammals found in Africa and the Middle East.

The word <span class="accented">shaphan</span> designates the <span class="accented">Hyrax Syriacus</span>, called by some the rock badger (see Hatrt, 'Animals of the Bible,' pp. 64, etc.). The coney, says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 2:90), "abounds in the gorge of the Kedron, and along the foot of the mountains west of the Dead Sea. It is of the size of the rabbit, but belongs to a very different order of animals, being placed by naturalists between the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. Its soft fur is brownish-grey over the back, with long black hairs rising through this lighter coat, and is almost white on the stomach; the tail is very short. The Jews, who were not scientific, deceived by the motion of its jaws in eating, which is exactly like that of ruminant animals, fancied it chewed the cud, though it did not divide the hoof, and so they put its flesh amidst that which was forbidden. It lives in companies, and chooses a ready-made cleft in the rocks for its home, so that, though the conies are but a 'feeble folk,' their refuge in the rocks gives them a security beyond that of stronger creatures. They are, moreover, 'exceeding wise,' so that it is very hard to capture one. Indeed, they are said, on high authority, to have sentries regularly placed on the look out while the rest are feeding; a squeak from the watchman sufficing to send the flock scudding to their holes like rabbits. The coney is found in many parts of Palestine, from Lebanon to the Dead Sea." <span class="cmt_word">In the rocks.</span> This fact is noticed in Psalm'civ. 18.
