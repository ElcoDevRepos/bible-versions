Throughout the Bible, the concept of righteousness is closely tied to living in accordance with God's laws and commands. In the Old Testament, figures like Noah and Daniel exemplify this righteousness and are delivered from perilous situations (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, <a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). The deliverance of the righteous is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>, which states, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all." This deliverance is not always immediate or in the form expected, but it is assured by God's faithfulness.<p><b>in his place the wicked man goes in.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the principle of divine justice, where the wicked ultimately face the consequences of their actions. The idea of the wicked taking the place of the righteous in trouble is seen in the story of Haman and Mordecai in the Book of Esther (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>), where Haman is hanged on the gallows he prepared for Mordecai. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as stated in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The wicked often fall into the very traps they set for others, illustrating the moral order established by God. This concept is also echoed in <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>, where the wicked fall into the pit they have made. The ultimate fulfillment of this justice is seen in the final judgment, where the wicked face eternal separation from God, while the righteous are rewarded with eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_man.htm">The Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents those who live according to God's commandments and seek to align their lives with His will. In the Hebrew text, the word for "righteous" is (tzaddik), which implies someone who is just, lawful, and morally upright.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who reject God's ways and live in opposition to His laws.
