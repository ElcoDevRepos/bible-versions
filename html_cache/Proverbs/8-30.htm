The imagery of a craftsman implies skill, precision, and intentionality, reflecting the order and design in the universe. This aligns with the biblical account of creation in Genesis, where God speaks the world into existence with purpose and structure. The concept of Wisdom as a craftsman can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a> as the Word through whom all things were made. This connection emphasizes the pre-existence of Christ and His integral role in creation, affirming the unity and harmony within the Godhead.<p><b>and His delight day by day</b><br>The phrase highlights a continuous, intimate relationship between Wisdom and God, characterized by delight and joy. This daily delight suggests a dynamic and ongoing interaction, not a one-time event. It reflects the biblical theme of God's pleasure in His creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God repeatedly declares His creation "good." The delight also points to the relational aspect of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in perfect love and joy. This relational delight is mirrored in the believer's relationship with God, where daily communion and fellowship bring joy and fulfillment.<p><b>rejoicing always in His presence</b><br>Rejoicing in God's presence underscores the joy and satisfaction found in communion with the Creator. This joy is not dependent on circumstances but is rooted in the eternal and unchanging nature of God. The concept of rejoicing in God's presence is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, which speaks of the fullness of joy in God's presence. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies Wisdom and brings believers into the presence of God through His redemptive work. The perpetual rejoicing signifies the ultimate fulfillment and purpose found in a relationship with God, both now and in eternity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, Wisdom is depicted as a divine attribute or being that was present with God during creation.

The verse assures us that creation is purposeful, birthed from intimate fellowship and unending celebration, and that the same joyful Creator now invites His people to share in His delight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">As one brought up with him--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, his foster child; as Mordecai "brought up" Esther (<a href="/esther/2-7.htm" title="And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.">Esther 2:7</a>). But the word may also bear the sense of "artificer." It probably occurs in this meaning in <a href="/jeremiah/52-15.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.">Jeremiah 52:15</a> (though translated "multitude," in accordance with <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm" title="Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.">2Kings 25:11</a>), and in a slightly different form, <a href="/songs/7-1.htm" title="How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.">Song of Solomon 7:1</a>.

The Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">amon</span>), "an artificer," "workman" (<a href="/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>). Thus in Wisd. 7:22 Wisdom is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the worker of all things." The Authorized Version takes the word in a passive state, as equivalent to <span class="accented">alumnus</span>, "foster child." and this interpretation is etymologically admissible, and may possibly, as Schultens suggests, be glanced at in St. John's expression (John 1:18), "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father." But as the point here is the creative energy of Wisdom, it is best to take the term as denoting "artificer." It will then accord with the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by the Fathers to the Word of God, by whom all things were made (<a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, Textus Receptus, and <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I was daily his delight;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was delights day by day</span>, which may mean either as in Authorized Version, or "I had delight continually," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it may signify <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either that God took pleasure in the wisdom which displayed his workmanship, saw that it was very good (<a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>, etc.), looked with delight on the beloved Son in whom he was well pleased (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.); or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may mean that Wisdom herself rejoiced in her power and her work, rejoiced in giving effect to the Creator's idea, and so "founding the earth" (<a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">delectabar per singulos dies.</span> The Septuagint adopts the former of these views, "I was that wherein he took delight." But the second interpretation seems most suitable, as the paragraph is stating rather what Wisdom is in herself than what she was in the eyes of Jehovah. What follows is a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing always before him;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">ludens coram eo omni tempore</span>, as though the work of creation was a sport and pastime of a happy holiday. The expression is meant to denote the ease with which the operations were performed, and the pleasure which their execution yielded. David uses the same word, speaking of his dancing before the ark, when he says. "Therefore will I play before the Lord" (<a href="/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>; comp. <a href="/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eh&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
