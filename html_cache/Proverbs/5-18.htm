In biblical times, a fountain was a vital source of water, essential for survival and prosperity, symbolizing abundance and blessing. The blessing of a fountain implies a divine favor upon one's family life and lineage. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to water as a symbol of life and blessing, such as in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where a righteous person is likened to a tree planted by streams of water. The idea of blessing here also connects to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promises to bless Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of marital fidelity and joy within the covenant of marriage. The reference to "the wife of your youth" suggests a lifelong commitment, encouraging the husband to find joy and satisfaction in the spouse of his early years. This reflects the biblical ideal of marriage as a permanent and exclusive union, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man is to leave his parents and be united to his wife. The call to "rejoice" in one's spouse aligns with the broader biblical theme of joy as a fruit of a godly life (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). Culturally, this underscores the value placed on marriage in ancient Israelite society, where family was central to social and religious life. The joy found in a faithful marriage can also be seen as a type of the relationship between Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>, where the love and commitment between husband and wife reflect Christ's love for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

(Comp. <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm" title="Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house: your children like olive plants round about your table.">Psalm 128:3</a>, where the wife is a "fruitful vine," and the children numerous and flourishing like olive-branches.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth</span>. The employment of the ordinary term "wife" in the second hemistich shows in what sense the figure which is used has to be understood. The terms "fountain" and "wife" denote the same person. The wife is here called "thy fountain" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">m'kor'ka</span>), just as she has been previously "thine own cistern" (<span class="accented">b'or</span>) and "thine own well" (<span class="accented">b'er</span>) in ver. 15. The Hebrew <span class="accented">makor</span>, "fountain," is derived from the root <span class="accented">kur</span>, "to dig." The figure seems to determine that the blessing here spoken of consists in the with being a fruitful mother of children; and hence the phrase means, "Let thy with be blessed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered happy in being the mother of thy children. This is quite consistent with the Hebrew mode of thought. Every Israelitish wife regarded herself, and was regarded by ethers as "blessed," if she bore children, and unhappy if the reverse were the case. <span class="accented">Blessed</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">baruk</span> (Vulgate, <span class="accented">benedicta</span>), is the kal participle passive of <span class="accented">barak</span>, "to bless." Instead of this, the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "Let thy fountain be thine own" - a variation which in no sense conveys the meaning of the original. <span class="accented">And rejoice with</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rejoice in</span>, the wife being regarded as the sphere within which the husband is to find his pleasure and joy. Umbreit explains, "Let thy wife be extolled." The same construction of the imperative <span class="accented">s'makh</span>, from <span class="accented">samakh</span>," to be glad, or joyful," with <span class="accented">min</span>, occurs in <a href="/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>, etc. The Authorized rendering is, however, favoured by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">laetare cum</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> Compare the exhortation in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>, "Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest." <span class="accented">The wife of thy youth</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ishshah n'ureyka</span>) may mean either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wife to whom thou hast given the fair bloom of thy youth (Umbreit); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wife chosen in thy youth (Delitzsch); or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> thy youthful wife. The former seems the more probable meaning.
