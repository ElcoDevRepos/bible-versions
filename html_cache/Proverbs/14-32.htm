In biblical context, sin is often portrayed as a snare or trap (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), leading to downfall. The imagery of being "thrown down" suggests a sudden and forceful fall, reminiscent of the fate of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, where they are described as perishing like smoke. Historically, the consequences of sin are evident in the narratives of figures like Saul (1 Samuel 31) and Judas Iscariot (<a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a>), whose sins led to their demise. Theologically, this reflects the principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>), where sin ultimately leads to destruction.<p><b>but the righteous man has a refuge even in death</b><br>This phrase contrasts the fate of the righteous with that of the wicked, emphasizing the security found in righteousness. The concept of refuge is a recurring theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>), where God is depicted as a stronghold and protector. The assurance of refuge "even in death" points to the hope of eternal life, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). This assurance is rooted in the covenantal promises of God, as seen in the life of Job, who expressed hope in a Redeemer (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>). Theologically, this foreshadows the resurrection and eternal security found in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>), who is the ultimate refuge for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>This term refers to individuals who live in opposition to God's laws and principles. In the context of Proverbs, the wicked are often characterized by their immoral behavior and lack of reverence for God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>These are individuals who live in accordance with God's will, striving to follow His commandments and maintain a relationship with Him. The righteous are often depicted as wise and blessed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>In this verse, death is not just a physical end but a transition point where the consequences of one's life choices are fully realized. For the wicked, it is a downfall, while for the righteous, it is a refuge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_wickedness.htm">The Consequences of Wickedness</a></b><br>Wickedness leads to self-destruction.

In his very act of sin, <span class="accented">flagrante delicto</span>, the wicked is defeated, driven from hope and life; as the Revised Version renders, "The wicked is thrust down in his evil doing;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there is some element of weakness in an evil deed which occasions its discovery and punishment, sooner or later. Thus "murder will out," we say. But the contrast is better emphasized by taking <span class="accented">ra</span> in its other sense of "calamity," "misfortune," thus: "In his calamity the wicked is cast down" (<a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). When misfortune comes upon him, he has no defence, no hope; he collapses utterly; all his friends forsake him; there is none to comfort or uphold him (comp. <a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous hath hope in his death</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:13). Primarily, the clause means that even in the greatest danger the good man loses not his trust in God. It is like Job's word (if our reading is correct, <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;" and the psalmist, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me" (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). Thus the Christian martyrs went joyfully to the stake, and gentle women and little children smiled on the sword which sent them home. It is natural to see in this clause a belief in a future life, and a state of rewards and punishments; and some commentators, holding that this doctrine was net known in pre-exilian days, have taken occasion from its plain enunciation in this paragraph to affix a very late date to our book. There are two answers to be made to this assertion. First, it is capable of proof that the belief in the immortality of the soul, with its consequences in another state, was held, however vaguely, by the Jews long before Solomon's time (see note, <a href="/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>); secondly, the present passage is by some read differently, whence is obtained another rendering, which removes from it all trace of the doctrine in question. Thus Ewald and others would read the clause in this way: "The righteous hath hope, or taketh refuge, from his own deeds." There can be no reasonable doubt that the usual reading and translation are correct; but the above considerations show that no argument as to the date of the Proverbs can be safely founded on this verse. The LXX. has a different reading for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>, "in his death," and translates, "But he who trusteth in his own holiness is just" - which looks like a travesty of Scripture, but probably refers to the consciousness of having a heart right with God and obedient to the requirements of the Divine Law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The wicked [man]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is thrown down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yid&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#7717;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1760.htm">Strong's 1760: </a> </span><span class="str2">To push, thrust</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by his own sin,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1469;&#1453;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the righteous [man]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1469;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has a refuge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;seh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2620.htm">Strong's 2620: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flee for, protection, to confide in</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he dies.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-32.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:32 The wicked is brought down in his (Prov.
