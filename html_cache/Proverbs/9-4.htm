In the biblical context, "simple" refers to those who are naive or inexperienced, lacking in understanding or discernment. This invitation is significant as it reflects the open and accessible nature of divine wisdom, which is available to all who seek it. The call to "turn in here" suggests a change of direction or repentance, a common theme throughout Scripture where turning towards God leads to life and understanding. This echoes the call of Jesus in the New Testament, who invites all who are weary and burdened to come to Him for rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p><b>She says to him who lacks judgment.</b><br>The phrase "lacks judgment" further describes the intended audience of Wisdom's call. It highlights a deficiency in discernment or the ability to make sound decisions. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, wisdom was highly valued and seen as essential for living a righteous and prosperous life. The lack of judgment is not a permanent state but one that can be remedied by heeding Wisdom's call. This aligns with the biblical principle that fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The invitation to those lacking judgment is a reminder of God's grace and willingness to impart wisdom to those who seek it earnestly. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), offering Himself as the ultimate source of truth and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman calling out to the simple and those lacking judgment.
