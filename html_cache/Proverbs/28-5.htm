In biblical terms, "evil men" refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws and principles. The Hebrew word for "evil" often implies wickedness and moral corruption. The lack of understanding of justice among evil men can be seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>, where it is said that they "walk about in darkness." Justice, in the biblical sense, is rooted in God's character and law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, where God is described as a "God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He." The inability of evil men to grasp justice is a result of their separation from God, who is the ultimate source of justice.<p><b>but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully</b><br>In contrast to evil men, those who "seek the LORD" are portrayed as having a full understanding of justice. Seeking the LORD implies a diligent pursuit of a relationship with God, characterized by prayer, study of Scripture, and obedience to His commandments. This pursuit is encouraged throughout the Bible, as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, "You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart." The promise of comprehension is tied to the idea that true wisdom and understanding come from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, "For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding." This phrase also reflects the biblical theme that spiritual insight and moral clarity are granted to those who earnestly seek God, aligning their lives with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/evil_men.htm">Evil Men</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who live in opposition to God's laws and principles.
