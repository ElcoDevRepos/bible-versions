Pits were often used as traps for animals or as prisons for people (<a href="/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The imagery suggests that engaging with a prostitute leads to spiritual and moral peril, akin to falling into a trap from which escape is difficult. The use of "deep pit" emphasizes the depth of the potential fall and the difficulty of extrication once ensnared. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on sexual immorality, which is consistently portrayed as leading to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-5</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>).<p><b>and an adulteress is a narrow well</b><br>A "narrow well" in ancient times would have been a source of life-giving water, but if narrow, it could be dangerous and difficult to access. This metaphor suggests that an adulteress, like a narrow well, may promise refreshment or satisfaction but ultimately leads to danger and difficulty. Wells were essential for survival in the arid regions of the Near East, and a narrow or treacherous well could symbolize false promises or hidden dangers. The comparison to an adulteress highlights the deceptive allure of adultery, which promises fulfillment but results in spiritual and relational harm (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32-33</a>, <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). This imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of faithfulness, contrasting the fidelity expected in marriage with the destructive nature of infidelity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitute.htm">Prostitute</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a prostitute represents not only literal sexual immorality but also spiritual unfaithfulness.

A narrow pit is one with a narrow month, from which, if one falls into it, it is difficult to extricate one's self. The verse indicates the seductive nature of the vice of unchastity: how easy it is to be led into it! how difficult to rise from it! Thus St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 11, in 1 Corinthians'), "When by unclean desire the soul is made captive, even as a cloud and mist darken the eyes of the body, so that desire intercepts the foresight of the mind, and suffers no one to see any distance before him, either precipice, or hell, or fear; but thenceforth, having that deceit as a tyrant over him, he comes to be easily vanquished by sin; and there is raised up before his eyes as it were a partition wall, and no windows in it, which suffers not the ray of righteousness to shine in upon the mind, the absurd conceits of lust enclosing it as with a rampart on all sides. And then, and from that time forward, the unchaste woman is everywhere meeting him - before his eyes, before his mind, before his thoughts, in station and presence. And as the blind, although they stand at high noon beneath the very central point of the heaven, receive not the light, their eyes being fast closed up; just so these also, though ten thousand doctrines of salvation sound in their ears from all quarters, having their soul preoccupied with this passion, stop their ears against all discourses of that kind. And they know it well who have made the trial. But God forbid that you should know it from actual experience!" The LXX. has changed the allusion: "For a strange house is a pierced wine jar (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and a strange well is narrow," where the idea seems to be that the private well, which is dug for the convenience of one family only, is not to be relied upon, and will yield not enough to supply others' wants. Hence would arise a warning against coveting a neighbour's wife. There is a Greek proverb about drawing wine into pierced jars (Xen., 'OEcon.,' 7:40). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/23-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a prostitute</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2181.htm">Strong's 2181: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commit adultery, to commit idolatry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a deep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;muq&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6013.htm">Strong's 6013: </a> </span><span class="str2">Deep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7745.htm">Strong's 7745: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chasm</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and an adulteress</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5237.htm">Strong's 5237: </a> </span><span class="str2">Foreign, alien</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a narrow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1437;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6862.htm">Strong's 6862: </a> </span><span class="str2">Narrow, a tight place, a pebble, an opponent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">well.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_875.htm">Strong's 875: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pit, a well</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/23-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 23:27 For a prostitute is a deep pit (Prov.
