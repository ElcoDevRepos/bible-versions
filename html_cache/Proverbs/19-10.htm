Proverbs frequently contrasts the wise and the foolish, emphasizing that wisdom leads to life and prosperity, while folly leads to ruin. The idea that luxury is unseemly for a fool suggests that wealth and comfort are inappropriate for someone who lacks the wisdom to use them properly. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true riches are found in wisdom and understanding (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>). The fool, lacking discernment, may misuse luxury, leading to moral and spiritual decay.<p><b>how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!</b><br>This phrase highlights the social and cultural norms of ancient Israel, where societal roles were clearly defined. A "slave" ruling over "princes" would be seen as a reversal of the natural order, causing disorder and instability. In the historical context, rulers were expected to be wise and just, qualities not typically associated with slaves in that era. This proverb underscores the importance of proper leadership and governance, echoing the biblical principle that those in authority should be equipped with wisdom and integrity (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15-16</a>). The imagery of a slave ruling over princes can also be seen as a metaphor for chaos and the consequences of folly, reinforcing the need for wisdom in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fool.htm">Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a fool is someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often rejecting God's ways and living in a manner contrary to His teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>This term refers to someone in a position of low status or authority, often expected to serve rather than lead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a></b><br>These are individuals of noble birth or high status, typically expected to lead and make decisions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_roles_and_wisdom.htm">Understanding Roles and Wisdom</a></b><br>God has established certain roles and structures in society.

Such a life is ruin to a fool. who knows not how to use it properly; it confirms him in his foolish, sinful ways. A man needs religion and reason to enable him to bear prosperity advantageously, and these the fool lacks. "Secundae res," remarks Sallust ('Catil.,' 11), "sapientium animos fatigant," "Even wise men are wearied and harassed by prosperity," much more must such good fortune try those who have no practical wisdom to guide and control their enjoyment. Vatablus explains the clause to mean that it is impossible for a fool, a sinner, to enjoy peace of conscience, which alone is true delight. But looking to the next clause, we see that the moralist is thinking primarily of the elevation of a slave to a high position, and his arrogance in consequence thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span> By the unwise favouritism of a potentate, a slave of lowly birth might be raised to eminence and set above the nobles and princes of the land. The writer of Ecclesiastes gives his experience in this matter: "I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>). The same anomaly is mentioned with censure (<a href="/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a> and Ecclus. 11:5). What is the behaviour of unworthy persons thus suddenly raised to high position has formed the subject of many a satire. It is the old story of the "beggar on horseback." A German proverb declares, "Kein Scheermesser scharfer schiest, als wenn der Bauer zu Herrn wird." Claud., 'In Eutrop.,' 181, etc. <p><span class="foreign">"Asperius nihil est humili, quum surgit in altum;<br />Cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet; desaevit in omnes,<br />Ut se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ulla<br />Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis."</span> As an example of a different disposition, Cornelius a Lapide refers to the history of Agathocles. Tyrant of Syracuse, who rose from the humble occupation of a potter to a position of vast power, and, to remind himself of his lowly origin, used to dine off mean earthenware. Ausonius thus alludes to this humility ('Epigr.,' 8.) - <p><span class="foreign">"Fama est fictilibus coenasse Agathoclea regem,<br />Atque abacum Samio saepe onerasse luto;<br />Fercula gemmatis cum poneret horrida vasis,<br />Et misceret opes pauperiemque simul.</span> <p><span class="foreign">Quaerenti causam, respondit: Rex ego qui sum<br />Sicaniae, figulo sum genitore satus<br />Fortunam reverenter habe, quicunque repente<br />Dives ab exili progrediere loco."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Luxury</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8588.htm">Strong's 8588: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daintiness, luxury, exquisite delight</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is unseemly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5000.htm">Strong's 5000: </a> </span><span class="str2">Suitable, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a fool&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7733;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">how much worse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1437;&#1431;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a slave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1444;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to rule</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1452;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4910.htm">Strong's 4910: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rule, have dominion, reign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over princes!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/19-10.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 19:10 Delicate living is not appropriate (Prov.
