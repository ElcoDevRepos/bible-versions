In ancient times, silver was a highly valued commodity, often used as currency and a measure of wealth. The comparison highlights the superior value of wisdom over material wealth. Biblically, wisdom is seen as a divine attribute, originating from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The pursuit of wisdom is encouraged as it leads to a life aligned with God's will, offering spiritual riches that surpass earthly treasures. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>, where wisdom is described as more valuable than gold and precious stones.<p><b>and her gain is better than fine gold</b><br>Gold, especially fine gold, was considered the pinnacle of wealth and prosperity in biblical times. It was used in the construction of the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>) and symbolized purity and divine glory. The verse suggests that the benefits of wisdom exceed even the most refined and purest forms of wealth. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. Wisdom's gain includes understanding, discernment, and a closer relationship with God, which are eternal and incorruptible, unlike material wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Pursue wisdom first, and the God who owns all treasures will handle the rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The merchandise</span> (<span class="accented">sakh'rah</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">acquisitio</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The gain arising from trading in wisdom is better than that which arises from trading in silver. <span class="accented">Sakh'rah</span> is the gain or profit arising from merchandise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from trading. It denotes the act itself of gaining. The root <span class="accented">sakrah</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, signifies "to go about for the sake of traffic," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to trade. There may be an allusion here, as in <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>, to the new commerce (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">The gain thereof</span> (<span class="accented">t'vuathah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gain existing in, and going along with, Wisdom herself; gain, therefore, in a different sense from that indicated in <span class="accented">sakh'rah.</span> Gesenius takes it as "gain resulting from Wisdom," as in <a href="/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>. The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate <span class="accented">fructus.</span> In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a "tree of life." The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, "The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold." <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">karuts</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">aurum purum</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">aurum purissimum. Kharuts</span> is the poetic word for gold, so called, either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Curtius); or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being dug up, from the root <span class="accented">kharats</span>, "to cut into or dig up, to sharpen." It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (<span class="accented">keseph</span>). The word is translated "choice gold" in <a href="/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; "gold" simply in <a href="/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; "yellow gold" in <a href="/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>; and "fine gold" in <a href="/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as <span class="accented">effosum aurum</span>, "gold dug up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of "molten gold" (<span class="accented">aurum conflatum</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she is more</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">profitable</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1453;&#1495;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(sa&#7717;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5504.htm">Strong's 5504: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commerce, gain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than silver,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and her gain [is better]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8393.htm">Strong's 8393: </a> </span><span class="str2">Product, revenue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than fine gold.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2742.htm">Strong's 2742: </a> </span><span class="str2">Incised, incisive, a trench, gold, a threshing-sledge, determination, eager</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-14.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:14 For her good profit is better than (Prov.
