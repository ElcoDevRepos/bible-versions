In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, working the land was a common occupation, and it required consistent effort and dedication. The principle here is that hard work leads to provision and sustenance. This is echoed in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where God tells Adam that he will eat bread by the sweat of his brow. The idea of reaping what one sows is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, which encourages believers not to grow weary in doing good, for in due season they will reap a harvest if they do not give up. The land in biblical times was also seen as a gift from God, a source of blessing and sustenance, as reflected in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, where the Promised Land is described as a place of abundance.<p><b>but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the diligent worker with someone who pursues unrealistic or impractical goals. The term "fantasies" can refer to schemes or pursuits that are not grounded in reality or wisdom. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, this could include get-rich-quick schemes or neglecting one's responsibilities in favor of idle dreams. The warning here is that such pursuits lead to poverty, both materially and spiritually. This is consistent with the biblical theme that wisdom and prudence lead to prosperity, while folly leads to ruin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, which states that the plans of the diligent lead to profit, but haste leads to poverty. The New Testament also warns against the love of money and the pursuit of wealth without regard for God's principles, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>, which cautions that those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_diligent_worker.htm">The Diligent Worker</a></b><br>This person represents those who are committed to their responsibilities and work hard to cultivate what they have been given.

It represents the resources and opportunities God provides to each person.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/poverty.htm">Poverty</a></b><br>A state of lacking material wealth, often resulting from poor choices or neglect of responsibilities. In the biblical context, it can also imply spiritual poverty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plenty_of_food.htm">Plenty of Food</a></b><br>This signifies the reward and provision that come from diligent work and responsible stewardship of one's resources.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_diligence.htm">The Value of Diligence</a></b><br>Diligence in our work is a biblical principle that leads to provision and blessing.

We must manage these wisely and work diligently to cultivate them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_implications.htm">Spiritual Implications</a></b><br>While the verse speaks to physical provision, it also has spiritual implications. Just as we must work diligently in our earthly tasks, we must also be diligent in our spiritual growth and relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_and_trust_in_god.htm">Contentment and Trust in God</a></b><br>Trusting in God's provision and being content with what we have is crucial.

Scripture consistently honors this kind of steady diligence:<p>&#8226; &#8220;He who tills his land will have plenty of bread&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>).<p>&#8226; From the beginning, God placed Adam &#8220;in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), underscoring that labor is part of His good design.<p>The message is straightforward: do the work set before you. Hard work is not a curse but a gift, an arena where faith meets obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will have plenty of food</b><p>Faithful labor meets practical reward: &#8220;will have plenty of food.&#8221; God ordinarily provides through ordinary means&#8212;plowing, planting, harvesting. Other passages echo this promise:<p>&#8226; &#8220;When you eat the labor of your hands, you will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The soul of the diligent is richly supplied&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in New Testament life, &#8220;If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), affirming that provision follows effort.<p>Abundance here is not merely surplus wealth; it is the sufficiency that comes from walking within God&#8217;s design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but whoever chases fantasies</b><p>The contrast shifts sharply: &#8220;but whoever chases fantasies.&#8221; Instead of steady effort, this person pursues pipe dreams&#8212;schemes that sound exciting but lack substance. Scripture warns against such restless ambition:<p>&#8226; &#8220;He who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a trap&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;A stingy man is eager to get rich and is unaware that poverty awaits him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>).<p>Whether it&#8217;s gambling, shortcuts, or get-rich-quick plans, the common thread is ignoring God&#8217;s pattern of faithful work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will have his fill of poverty</b><p>The outcome is inevitable: &#8220;will have his fill of poverty.&#8221; The phrase pictures being satisfied&#8212;ironically&#8212;with lack. Disregard God&#8217;s wisdom, and want becomes the only portion. Other verses reinforce the cause-and-effect:<p>&#8226; &#8220;For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-21.htm">Proverbs 23:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>Poverty here is more than empty pockets; it can include broken relationships, lost integrity, and spiritual barrenness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/28-19.htm">Proverbs 28:19</a> draws a stark line: diligent, faithful work leads to God-given provision; reckless dreaming apart from effort ends in want. The verse calls believers to honor the Lord by laboring responsibly, trusting that He rewards obedience with enough, while warning that shortcuts away from His path produce only emptiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread.</span>--The curse of <a href="/context/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake;
