In biblical times, honoring one's parents was a fundamental commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and cursing them was a serious offense (<a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>). The act of cursing one's father signifies a rebellion against God-ordained authority. This generational behavior can be seen as a fulfillment of warnings about the last days, where disobedience to parents is listed among other sins (<a href="/2_timothy/3.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-2</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on family honor, making this behavior particularly egregious.<p><b>and do not bless their mothers.</b><br>Failing to bless one's mother indicates a lack of gratitude and appreciation for her role and sacrifices. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, mothers were revered for their nurturing and pivotal role in the family. The absence of blessing reflects a broader societal decay in moral and familial values. This behavior contrasts with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the importance of a mother's teaching (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). The failure to bless can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual ingratitude, where people fail to acknowledge and thank God for His providence, similar to how they neglect their earthly mothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur is a figure about whom little is known, but he is recognized for his wisdom and insights into human behavior and divine truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_generation.htm">The Generation</a></b><br>This refers to a group or type of people characterized by their disrespect and ingratitude towards their parents, which is a broader reflection of societal attitudes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers_and_mothers.htm">Fathers and Mothers</a></b><br>Symbolic of parental authority and the family unit, which are foundational to societal structure and moral teaching in biblical contexts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_parental_authority.htm">Respect for Parental Authority</a></b><br>The verse highlights the importance of respecting and honoring parents as a reflection of one's character and obedience to God's commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_reflection.htm">Generational Reflection</a></b><br>Each generation is called to self-examination to ensure they are not characterized by the negative traits described in this proverb.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_and_spiritual_decline.htm">Cultural and Spiritual Decline</a></b><br>Disrespect towards parents can be seen as a symptom of broader cultural and spiritual decline, urging believers to uphold biblical values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_family.htm">Role of the Family</a></b><br>The family is a God-ordained institution, and maintaining respect within it is crucial for societal stability and spiritual health.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance_and_restoration.htm">Call to Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>For those who recognize these traits in themselves, there is a call to repentance and a return to biblical principles of honoring parents.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_30_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 30:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_30_11_on_generational_disrespect.htm">How does Proverbs 30:11 describe the behavior of certain generations toward parents?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_effects_of_dishonoring_parents.htm">What are the consequences of dishonoring parents according to biblical teachings?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Fostering_parental_respect_today.htm">How can we cultivate respect for parents in today's society?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_honoring_parents.htm">Which other scriptures emphasize honoring parents, and how do they relate?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Proverbs_30_11_in_family_ties.htm">How can families implement Proverbs 30:11 to strengthen their relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_30_11_on_generational_respect.htm">How does Proverbs 30:11 reflect generational differences in respect and values?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Proverbs_30_11.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Proverbs 30:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_30_11_vs_modern_family_views.htm">How does Proverbs 30:11 challenge modern views on family dynamics?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_30.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_is_blessed_in_the_lord's_name.htm">What advice do the ungodly offer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_sin_directly_cause_illness.htm">Psalm 31:10 links sin to physical weakness--does any scientific or historical evidence suggest moral wrongdoing can directly cause illness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_inherit_david's_throne.htm">Would Jesus inherit David's throne?

Scripture often speaks of a &#8220;generation&#8221; to describe collective character rather than chronology (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>). By using this phrase:<p>&#8226; Agur acknowledges recurring seasons when society drifts from God&#8217;s order.<p>&#8226; The wording implies that believers should be discerning, able to spot cultural patterns that oppose God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; It warns that moral decline is not confined to ancient Israel; any culture can slide into the same rebellion when it forgets the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who curse their fathers</b><p>&#8220;To curse&#8221; is more than harsh words; it is to treat one&#8217;s father with contempt, rejecting his God&#8208;given authority. This violates the fifth commandment, &#8220;Honor your father and your mother&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a> &#8211; &#8220;Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness.&#8221; Immediate judgment is pictured as unavoidable.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16</a> &#8211; God placed a formal curse on those who despise parents, showing how seriously He views domestic authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a> foretells a day when hearts of fathers and children will be reconciled, highlighting that broken family relationships grieve God&#8217;s purpose.<p>Rejecting a father&#8217;s instruction usually snowballs into resisting any authority, whether civil, ecclesiastical, or divine. The result is social instability&#8212;exactly what we see whenever a culture mocks paternal leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And do not bless their mothers</b><p>Failing to &#8220;bless&#8221; a mother is more than neglect; it is withholding the gratitude, respect, and care she is due. The verse balances the stern warning about cursing a father with a softer, yet equally serious, omission toward the mother:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22&#8211;25</a> calls children to &#8220;listen to your father&#8221; and &#8220;do not despise your mother when she is old,&#8221; promising joy to parents who are honored.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2&#8211;3</a> reiterates the commandment with a promise: &#8220;Honor your father and mother,&#8221; so &#8220;it may go well with you and you may live long on the earth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus modeled this even from the cross, entrusting His mother to John (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26&#8211;27</a>), showing that honoring one&#8217;s mother is lifelong.<p>To &#8220;bless&#8221; parents includes speaking well of them, providing for them, and esteeming their role. When a generation refuses to bless its mothers, it displays ingratitude toward the very source of its nurture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11</a> exposes a recognizable class of people who despise parental authority and withhold the honor God commands. Such attitudes are symptomatic of a larger cultural rebellion against God Himself. By honoring father and mother&#8212;in word, attitude, and action&#8212;believers reflect obedience to Scripture, preserve social stability, and receive God&#8217;s promised blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">There is a generation </span>. . .--The words <span class= "ital">"</span>there is" are not in the Hebrew, so it is left in doubt what is the predicate of these four evil "generations," whether Agur means by them to describe the men of his own time, or to say that such are unbearable. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/30-21.htm" title="For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:">Proverbs 30:21</a>.) The same characters are to be found in the description of men of the "last days" (<a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2Timothy 3:1</a> <span class= "ital">sqq</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-31</span> contain six groups of four sentences each, each quaternion having a certain connection in language and concinnity of idea. First (vers. 11-14) come four generations that are evil - four being taken as the symbol of universality. The sins herein specified had become so general that they affected the whole generation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a generation that eurseth their father.</span> The words, "there is," are not found in the Hebrew, and the four subjects are without a predicate. Delitzsch calls the group "a mutilated priamel," which is explained to be a kind of gnomic poetry containing a series of antecedents or subjects followed by an epigrammatic conclusion applicable to all the antecedents. In the present ease the conclusion is wanting, so that we are left in doubt whether the author meant merely to de. scribe classes of men in his own time or to affirm that such are abominable. Septuagint, "A wicked generation curseth its father (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," which expression is repeated at each of the four verses. The first sin is that which offends against the commandment to honour and obey parents. This was judged worthy of death under the old Law (<a href="/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; see <a href="/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">And doth not bless their mother.</span> This is a <span class="accented">litotes</span>, "not to bless" being equivalent to "to curse." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There is a generation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1453;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1755.htm">Strong's 1755: </a> </span><span class="str2">A revolution of time, an age, generation, a dwelling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of those who curse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;qal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7043.htm">Strong's 7043: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be slight, swift or trifling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their fathers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1469;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1288.htm">Strong's 1288: </a> </span><span class="str2">To kneel, to bless God, man, to curse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their mothers.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1437;&#1502;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/30-11.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 30:11 There is a generation that curses their (Prov.
