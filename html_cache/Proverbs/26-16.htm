In biblical context, laziness is frequently condemned (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>, <a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-34</a>). The slacker's self-perception is skewed, as he believes himself to be wise despite his lack of diligence and productivity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of pride leading to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The slacker's self-assessment contrasts with the biblical call to humility and reliance on God's wisdom (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>than seven men who answer discreetly</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness or perfection (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Here, it suggests a group of individuals who possess true wisdom and discernment. These men are characterized by their ability to answer discreetly, implying thoughtfulness, prudence, and understanding. This contrasts sharply with the slacker's self-perceived wisdom. The discreet men embody the biblical ideal of wisdom, which is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is a key theme throughout the book of Proverbs. This phrase underscores the value of true wisdom and discernment over self-deception and pride.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sluggard.htm">The Sluggard</a></b><br>A recurring character in Proverbs, representing laziness and a lack of diligence.

The idle fool sets more value by his own judgment than by the sense of any number of wise men. Revised Version margin, "that can answer discreetly," is perhaps nearer the Hebrew, which implies the being able to return a wise and proper answer to anything asked of them.
