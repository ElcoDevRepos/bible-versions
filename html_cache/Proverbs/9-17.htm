In biblical times, water was a precious resource, especially in arid regions like Israel. The idea of "stolen water" suggests something taken illicitly, which can seem more desirable because it is forbidden. This reflects the human tendency to covet what is not rightfully ours, echoing the temptation in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>, where Eve saw the forbidden fruit as desirable. The sweetness of stolen water is a metaphor for the initial pleasure of sin, which ultimately leads to negative consequences, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a>, where bread gained by deceit is sweet but turns to gravel.<p><b>and bread eaten in secret is tasty!</b><br>The act of eating bread in secret implies engaging in actions that one knows are wrong, yet finds pleasurable. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sharing meals was a communal activity, and eating in secret suggests a breach of trust and community norms. This secrecy highlights the shame and guilt associated with sin, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. The temporary satisfaction of secret sin is contrasted with the lasting fulfillment found in righteousness, as Jesus offers Himself as the Bread of Life in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, providing true and eternal sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Wisdom offered flesh and wine to her guests; Folly offers bread and water. Wisdom invites openly to a well furnished table; Folly calls to a secret meal of barest victuals. What the former offers is rich and satisfying and comforting; what Vice gives is poor and mean and insipid. Yet this latter has the charm of being forbidden; it is attractive because it is unlawful. This is a trait of corrupt human nature, which is recognized universally. Thus Ovid, 'Amor.,' 3:4, 17 - <p><span class="foreign">"Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata;<br />Sic interdictis imminet aeger aquis.'</span> Things easily attained, the possession of which is gotten without effort or danger or breach of restraint, soon pall and cease to charm. To some minds the astuteness and secrecy required for success have an irresistible attraction. Thus St. Augustine relates ('Conf.,' 2:4) how he and some companions committed a theft, not from want and poverty, nor even from the wish to enjoy what was stolen, but simply for the pleasure of thieving and the sin. They robbed a pear tree by night, carried off great loads, which they flung to the pigs, and their only satisfaction was that they were doing what they ought not ("dum tamen fieret a nobis, quod eo liberet quo non liceret"). Septuagint, "Taste ye to your pleasure secret bread, and sweet water of theft." Where water is a precious commodity, as in many pets of Palestine, doubtless thefts were often committed, and persons made free with their neighbor's tank when they could do so undetected, thus sparing their own resources and felicitating themselves on their cleverness. On the metaphorical use of "waters" in Holy Scripture, St. Gregory says, "Waters are sometimes wont to denote the Holy Spirit, sometimes sacred knowledge, sometimes calamity, sometimes drifting peoples, sometimes the minds of those following the faith." He refers to these texts respectively: <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>, etc.; Ecclus. 15:3; <a href="/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> ("the waters are peoples"); <a href="/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a>; and he adds, "By water likewise bad knowledge is wont to be designated, as when the woman in Solomon, who bears the type of heresy, charms with crafty persuasion, saying, 'Stolen waters are sweet'" ('Moral.,' 19:9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Stolen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1589.htm">Strong's 1589: </a> </span><span class="str2">To thieve, to deceive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;yim-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4325.htm">Strong's 4325: </a> </span><span class="str2">Water, juice, urine, semen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is sweet,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;t&#257;&#183;q&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4985.htm">Strong's 4985: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become or be sweet or pleasant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1430;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[eaten] in secret</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5643.htm">Strong's 5643: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covering, hiding place, secrecy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is tasty!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yin&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5276.htm">Strong's 5276: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be pleasant, delightful, or lovely</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/9-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 9:17 Stolen water is sweet (Prov.
