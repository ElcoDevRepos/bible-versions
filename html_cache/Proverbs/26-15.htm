In ancient Near Eastern culture, meals were often shared from a common dish, and eating was a communal activity. The image of a person who cannot even muster the energy to feed themselves from a shared dish highlights extreme laziness. This reflects a broader biblical theme where diligence is praised (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>) and laziness is condemned (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>). The slacker's behavior contrasts with the industriousness encouraged throughout Proverbs, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility and effort.<p><b>it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.</b><br>This hyperbolic statement underscores the absurdity of the slacker's laziness. The act of bringing food to one's mouth is one of the simplest tasks, yet the slacker finds it exhausting. This exaggeration serves to ridicule the slacker's lack of initiative and highlights the consequences of laziness, such as poverty and unfulfilled potential (<a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-34</a>). In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a warning against spiritual complacency, where one might have access to spiritual nourishment but lacks the motivation to partake in it. This connects to the New Testament call to be active in faith and good works (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The slacker's behavior is antithetical to the diligence and perseverance exemplified by Jesus Christ, who consistently fulfilled His mission despite challenges (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sluggard.htm">The Sluggard</a></b><br>A recurring character in Proverbs, representing laziness and a lack of diligence.
