In ancient Israelite society, the family was a central unit, and the father's reputation and legacy were closely tied to his children's actions. A foolish son, one who acts without wisdom or moral integrity, brings shame and distress to his father. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, which states that a wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief. The biblical narrative of Eli and his sons in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a> serves as a historical example, where the sons' wickedness led to their father's downfall. The cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient Near East further amplifies the father's ruin, as a son's folly could lead to social and economic consequences for the entire family.<p><b>and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping</b><br>This part of the proverb uses the metaphor of a constant dripping to describe the persistent and wearing nature of living with a contentious spouse. In the arid climate of the ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, and a leaking roof or constant dripping would be both wasteful and irritating. The imagery suggests a sense of ongoing annoyance and discomfort, which can erode the peace and stability of a household. Similar sentiments are found in <a href="/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 and 21</a>:19, which advise that it is better to live in a corner of a roof or in the wilderness than with a contentious and vexing woman. The cultural context of marriage in biblical times emphasized harmony and partnership, and a quarrelsome wife would disrupt this ideal. This proverb underscores the importance of a peaceful home environment, which is a recurring theme in wisdom literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foolish_son.htm">Foolish Son</a></b><br>Represents a child who acts unwisely, causing distress and trouble for his father.

The flat roofs of Eastern houses, formed of planks loosely joined and covered with a coating of clay or plaster, were always subject to leakage in heavy rains.

The Scotch say, "A leaky house and a scolding wife are two bad companions." The two clauses of the verse are coordinate, expressing two facts that render home life miserable and unendurable, viz. the misbehaviour of a son and the ill temper of a wife.
