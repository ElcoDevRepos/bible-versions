In biblical context, words are seen as powerful tools that can either build up or destroy (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). The imagery of being "trapped" suggests a situation where one's own speech has led to unintended consequences, reflecting the wisdom literature's emphasis on careful speech. Historically, in ancient Israel, oaths and promises were binding, and breaking them could lead to severe social and legal repercussions (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This phrase serves as a warning to be mindful of what one says, as words can create obligations that are difficult to escape.<p><b>ensnared by the words of your mouth</b><br>The term "ensnared" further emphasizes the idea of being caught or entangled by one's own speech. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of integrity and truthfulness (<a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2-12</a>). The mouth, as a source of speech, is often depicted in Scripture as a reflection of the heart's condition (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, verbal agreements were as binding as written contracts, and failing to fulfill them could damage one's reputation and relationships. This phrase underscores the importance of wisdom and discernment in communication, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the significance of every word spoken (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The Authorized Version rightly regards this as the conclusion. So the Vulgate. Others, however, carry on the hypothesis, and insert <span class="accented">im</span>, "if:" "If thou art snared," etc.; but without warrant (Zockler, Wordsworth, Plumptre). The LXX. throws the thought into the form of a proverb, as "a strong net to a man are his own words." A distinction is to be drawn between the verbs rendered "entangled" and "taken;" the former, <span class="accented">yakosh</span>, signifying to be taken unwarily, off one's guard; the latter, <span class="accented">lakad</span>, referring, as before observed (cf. <a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), to the being stricken with the net. They are found in the same collocation in <a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>, "Many among them shall be <span class="accented">snared</span> and <span class="accented">taken."</span> The repetition of the phrase, "with the words of thy mouth," is not unintentional or purely rhetorical. It is made, as Delitzsch observes, to bring with greater force to the mind that the entanglements in which the surety is involved are the result of his own indiscretion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if you have been trapped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1463;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;w&#183;qa&#353;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3369.htm">Strong's 3369: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay a bait or lure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;im&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_561.htm">Strong's 561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something said</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your lips,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ensnared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1437;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(nil&#183;ka&#7695;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3920.htm">Strong's 3920: </a> </span><span class="str2">To catch, to capture, occupy, to choose, to cohere</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;im&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_561.htm">Strong's 561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something said</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your mouth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-2.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:2 You are trapped by the words (Prov.
