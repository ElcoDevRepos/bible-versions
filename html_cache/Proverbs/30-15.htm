The imagery of the leech having "two daughters" named "Give and Give" emphasizes the relentless and unending demand for more. This reflects a broader biblical theme of warning against greed and covetousness, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, which states that those who love money will never be satisfied. The repetition of "Give" underscores the idea of perpetual dissatisfaction and the destructive nature of unchecked desires.<p><b>There are three things that are never satisfied,</b><br>The use of numerical sayings, such as "three things," is a common literary device in Hebrew wisdom literature, designed to capture attention and emphasize the completeness or intensity of the list. This structure is also found in other parts of Proverbs (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>) and serves to highlight the insatiable nature of certain elements in life. The number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, suggesting that these examples are comprehensive in illustrating the concept of insatiability.<p><b>four that never say, &#8216;Enough!&#8217;:</b><br>The progression from three to four items is a poetic technique that adds emphasis and weight to the list. The number four can symbolize universality or totality, indicating that the examples given are representative of a broader truth about human nature and the world. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of contentment and the dangers of excess, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>, where Paul speaks of learning to be content in all circumstances. The concept of never saying "Enough" warns against the futility of seeking fulfillment in worldly desires, pointing instead to the sufficiency found in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leech.htm">The Leech</a></b><br>A parasitic creature known for its insatiable appetite for blood.

So it forms an introduction to the quartette of "insatiable things" which follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - Having spoken of insatiate cupidity, the writer now introduces four things which are insatiable. The form of the apothegm is climacteric, mounting from two to three, and thence to four, like the famous passage in <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>, etc. (comp. <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>, though there is no special stress there laid on the last member of the climax; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.</span> The word "crying" is not in the Hebrew, which says, "The <span class="accented">alukah</span> hath two daughters: Give! Give!" The insatiable appetite of this creature is represented by two words, which are personified as daughters, whom the mother has produced and dearly loves. This word <span class="accented">alukah</span> is not found again in the Old Testament; but in later Hebrew and in Aramaic it means "leech" or "bloodsucker;" and so it is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, and by St. Jerome <span class="accented">sanguisuga</span>. The word is derived from a root which in Arabic means "to adhere." There are several kinds of leeches common in Palestine, and their bloodthirsty nature is well known; as Horace says, 'Ars Poet.,' 476 - <p><span class="foreign">"Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris, hirudo."</span> It seems simple and quite satisfactory to accept the word thus, and to see in the voracity of the leech an example of the greed further developed in the following clauses; but commentators have not been contented with this explanation, and have offered various suggestions which are either unnecessary or inadmissible. Thus the Talmud considers <span class="accented">alukah</span> to be an appellation of hell, and the two daughters to be the Power of the world, and Heresy. Some of the Fathers regard it as a symbol of the devil and his dominion; others, as a personification of cupidity with its two offshoots avarice and ambition. Some moderns deem it to mean a vampire or blood thirsty demon, a ghoul, in accordance with Eastern myth. But, as we have said, such interpretations are unnecessary and unsupported by sufficient authority. The allusion to the tastes of the leech is found elsewhere. Thus Theocritus, 'Idyll.,' 2:55 - <p><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> And Plautus, 'Epidic.,' 2:2, 5 - <p><span class="foreign">"Jam ego me convortam in hirudinem atque<br />Eorum exsugebo sanguinem,<br />Senati qui columen cluent."</span> Ewald and others find traces of mutilation in this proverb, and endeavour to supply what is lost in various ways; but the text as it stands is intelligible, and needs no addition. The rest of the verse is an application of the truth first stated. The type of cupidity there enunciated is instanced and exemplified in four special cases. <span class="cmt_word">There are three things that are never satisfied.</span> And then a corrective climax is addressed. Yea, <span class="cmt_word">four things say not, It is enough.</span> The four in the following verse are divided into two plus two.
