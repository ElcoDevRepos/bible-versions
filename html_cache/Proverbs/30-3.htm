In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The speaker, Agur, recognizes that true wisdom is not merely intellectual but spiritual, rooted in a relationship with God. This humility is echoed in Solomon's request for wisdom in <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7-9</a>, where he admits his own inadequacy. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed high value on wisdom literature, yet this statement underscores that human efforts alone cannot attain divine wisdom.<p><b>and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.</b><br>The "Holy One" refers to God, emphasizing His transcendence and holiness. This phrase highlights the speaker's recognition of the vast gap between human understanding and the divine nature. In <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>, Zophar questions whether humans can fathom the mysteries of God, reinforcing this theme. Theologically, this points to the necessity of divine revelation for true knowledge of God, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). The phrase also connects to the prophetic tradition, where knowledge of God is seen as a gift granted by God Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known. His words reflect humility and a deep awareness of human limitations in understanding divine wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_one.htm">The Holy One</a></b><br>This term refers to God, emphasizing His holiness and separateness from human understanding.

His words model genuine humility&#8212;an attitude Scripture repeatedly commends. &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>- By admitting a lack of wisdom, Agur places himself in the company of Job, who asked, &#8220;But where can wisdom be found?&#8221; (<a href="/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12</a>), and Solomon, who declared, &#8220;I am only a little child; I do not know how to carry out my duties&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>).<p>- This humility clears the way for God to teach. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> encourages, &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God.&#8221; Paul reinforces the point: &#8220;Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20&#8211;25</a>).<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Stay teachable&#8212;our best learning begins when we admit how much we still need.<p>&#8226; Let God&#8217;s Word define wisdom; trust its sufficiency because &#8220;Every word of God is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Seek wisdom through prayerful dependence, not mere intellect (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have no knowledge of the Holy One</b><p>- Agur continues, &#8220;and I have no knowledge of the Holy One&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>). The phrase &#8220;Holy One&#8221; points to God in His unique, set-apart perfection (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p>- Scripture teaches that knowing God is not achieved by human effort alone. &#8220;No one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>). Paul echoes, &#8220;The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>- Agur&#8217;s admission anticipates the need for revelation, which he supplies in the very next verse with questions that magnify God&#8217;s greatness (<a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>). True knowledge flows downward from heaven to earth.<p>- Cross-woven truths:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> couples wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One, showing they rise and fall together.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a> urges boasting only &#8220;that he understands and knows Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, Christ fulfills the longing: &#8220;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers now possess &#8220;the knowledge of the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a> invites us to the posture of humble learners. Agur&#8217;s double confession&#8212;lack of wisdom and lack of knowledge of the Holy One&#8212;pushes us to seek both in the one place they can be found: God&#8217;s flawless Word and the revelation of Himself through Christ.
