In the cultural context of ancient Israel, where oral communication was paramount, listening was a critical skill. The Hebrew culture valued the role of elders and wise counselors, who were expected to listen carefully before giving advice or making judgments. This principle is echoed in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, which advises believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak." The act of answering prematurely is seen as a failure to exercise discernment and patience, virtues highly esteemed in the biblical tradition.<p><b>this is folly and disgrace to him.</b><br>The terms "folly" and "disgrace" highlight the negative consequences of speaking without understanding. In the wisdom literature of the Bible, folly is often contrasted with wisdom and is associated with moral and spiritual failure. Proverbs frequently warns against foolish behavior, which leads to shame and dishonor. The disgrace mentioned here can be understood as a loss of reputation and respect within the community, a serious matter in a society where honor and social standing were crucial. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical narrative that values humility and the pursuit of wisdom, as seen in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who exemplified perfect understanding and discernment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
