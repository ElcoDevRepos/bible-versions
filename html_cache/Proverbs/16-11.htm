The LORD's involvement signifies that true justice is not merely a human construct but is rooted in God's character. This aligns with the biblical principle that God is just and desires His people to reflect His justice in their dealings (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13-16</a>). The use of honest scales is a metaphor for integrity in all aspects of life, pointing to the moral and ethical standards that God expects from His followers.<p><b>all the weights in the bag are His concern.</b><br>Weights were used in conjunction with scales to measure goods accurately. In the ancient Near East, dishonest merchants might use different weights to cheat customers, a practice condemned in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>). This phrase underscores God's omniscience and His concern for honesty in even the smallest details of life. It suggests that God is aware of and cares about the integrity of every transaction, no matter how minor it may seem. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is concerned with the heart and actions of individuals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The phrase also implies accountability, reminding believers that they are ultimately answerable to God for their actions. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies perfect justice and truth, and who will judge the world with righteousness (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

In ancient marketplaces, merchants used stones and beams to weigh grain, oil, metals, or fabric. God&#8217;s people were expected to keep those tools calibrated:<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a> urges, &#8220;You shall do no wrong in judgment&#8230; You shall have honest balances, honest weights.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> echoes, &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but an accurate weight is His delight.&#8221;<p>By pointing to visible, everyday equipment, Scripture spotlights integrity where commerce meets character. If the scale reads true, it shows a heart that loves truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are from the LORD</b><p>The verse continues, underscoring that &#8220;Honest scales and balances are from the LORD.&#8221; God is not merely a supporter of fairness; He is its source. Every reliable standard traces back to His nature.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> adds, &#8220;For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.&#8221;<p>A merchant who keeps his weights aligned with truth is really aligning them with God Himself. The believer&#8217;s business ethics become an act of worship, acknowledging that fairness originates in the character of the Creator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the weights in the bag</b><p>Merchants carried multiple stones in a pouch&#8212;small for coins, large for grain. Proverbs draws attention to &#8220;all the weights,&#8221; big and tiny, seen and unseen.<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a> asks, &#8220;Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a> teaches, &#8220;Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much.&#8221;<p>The Lord&#8217;s spotlight sweeps across every transaction, down to the smallest measure.

The great principles of truth end justice govern all the transactions of buying and selling; religion enters into the business of trading, and weights and measures are sacred things. Vulgate, "The weights and the balance are judgments of the Lord;" being true and fair, they are regarded as God's judgment. Septuagint, "The turn of the balance is justice before God." <span class="cmt_word">All the weights of the bag are his work.</span> Some have round a difficulty here, because the bag may contain false as well as true weights (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>), and it could not be said that the light weights were the Lord's work. This surely is captious criticism. The maxim merely states that the trader's weights take their origin and authority from God's enactment, from certain eternal principles which he has established. What man's chicanery and fraud make of them does not come into view. (For the law that regulates such matters, see <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>. The religious character of the standard weights and measures is shown by the term "shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, and elsewhere continually). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Honest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;p&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4941.htm">Strong's 4941: </a> </span><span class="str2">A verdict, a sentence, formal decree, divine law, penalty, justice, privilege, style</span><br /><br /><span class="word">scales</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1500;&#1462;&#1505; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(pe&#183;les)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6425.htm">Strong's 6425: </a> </span><span class="str2">A balance, scale</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and balances</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1488;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#333;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - mdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3976.htm">Strong's 3976: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pair of scales</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[are from] the LORD;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the weights</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_68.htm">Strong's 68: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stone</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the bag</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1505;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#238;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3599.htm">Strong's 3599: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cup, a bag for, money, weights</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are His concern.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1437;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4639.htm">Strong's 4639: </a> </span><span class="str2">An action, a transaction, activity, a product, property</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 16:11 Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's (Prov.
