In biblical times, poverty was a common issue, and the Law of Moses included provisions for the poor, such as gleaning laws (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). The act of opening one's arms signifies a welcoming and inclusive attitude, reflecting God's own heart for the marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). This mirrors the actions of Jesus, who consistently reached out to the poor and downtrodden (<a href="/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>). The imagery of open arms suggests not only giving but also embracing, indicating a personal and relational approach to charity.<p><b>and reaches out her hands to the needy.</b><br>The extension of hands symbolizes active engagement and effort in providing assistance. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, physical gestures were significant, and reaching out one's hands was a sign of offering help and support. This action is reminiscent of God's own provision and care, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>, where God opens His hand to satisfy the desires of every living thing. The phrase also connects to the New Testament teaching of faith being demonstrated through works (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>). The woman's actions are a type of Christ, who reached out to humanity in its need, offering salvation and healing (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>). This proactive stance against poverty and need is a call to believers to embody the love and compassion of Christ in tangible ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing wisdom, virtue, and godly character.
