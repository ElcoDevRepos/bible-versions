In biblical context, the tongue is often depicted as a tool that can either build up or tear down (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). The ungodly man, lacking reverence for God, uses his speech to harm others, reflecting a heart that is not aligned with divine wisdom. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures placed significant emphasis on the spoken word, understanding it as a force that could shape reality. This aligns with the biblical view that words have the power to bless or curse (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). The destructive nature of the ungodly man's words can be seen as a reflection of the deceit and malice that are contrary to the character of God, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>but through knowledge the righteous are rescued</b><br>In contrast, this phrase emphasizes the protective power of knowledge, particularly knowledge rooted in the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The righteous, those who live in accordance with God's will, find deliverance through understanding and discernment. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but is deeply connected to a relationship with God and adherence to His commandments. The concept of rescue or deliverance is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with God's intervention on behalf of His people (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>). This deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate source of salvation and wisdom for believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). The righteous are preserved not by their own strength but by their reliance on divine wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ungodly_man.htm">The Ungodly Man</a></b><br>This refers to a person who lacks reverence for God and often acts in ways that are contrary to God's will.
