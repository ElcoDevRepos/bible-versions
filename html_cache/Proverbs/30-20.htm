Adultery is condemned throughout Scripture as a violation of the marriage covenant, which is sacred and reflective of God's covenant with His people (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>). The adulteress here symbolizes not only literal infidelity but also spiritual unfaithfulness, as seen in Israel's idolatry (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>). The warning against such behavior is consistent with the wisdom literature's emphasis on moral integrity and the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p><b>She eats and wipes her mouth</b><br>This imagery suggests a casual and dismissive attitude towards sin. Eating and wiping the mouth imply that the adulteress treats her actions as ordinary and without consequence. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, meals were significant social and religious events, often involving rituals of purification. The act of wiping her mouth symbolizes an attempt to erase evidence of wrongdoing, akin to how people might try to cover up sin without true repentance. This reflects a hardened heart, indifferent to the moral and spiritual implications of her actions.<p><b>and says, &#8216;I have done nothing wrong.&#8217;</b><br>This statement highlights the self-deception and moral blindness of the adulteress. It echoes the human tendency to justify sin and avoid accountability, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The denial of wrongdoing is a rejection of God's law, which clearly defines adultery as sin (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). This attitude contrasts with the call to repentance and acknowledgment of sin found in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. The adulteress's claim of innocence is a stark reminder of the need for humility and the recognition of one's need for God's grace and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adulteress.htm">Adulteress</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing a person who engages in sexual immorality and deceit.

Septuagint, "Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has committed the act, having washed herself, says she has done nothing amiss." She forgets him who seeth in secret, and is quite content to escape detection at man's eyes, and to assume the character of a virtuous wife, which popular report assigns to her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;
