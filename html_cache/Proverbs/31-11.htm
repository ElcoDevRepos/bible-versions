In biblical times, trust within a marriage was crucial for the stability of the household. The heart, often seen as the seat of emotions and will, signifies a profound level of trust that goes beyond mere reliance. This trust is reflective of the covenant relationship seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where husband and wife become one flesh. The trust here can be compared to the trust God desires from His people, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>, "Trust in the LORD with all your heart." The virtuous woman is a type of the Church, the Bride of Christ, who is trusted by her Bridegroom, Jesus.<p><b>and he lacks nothing of value</b><br>This phrase suggests that the wife contributes significantly to the well-being and prosperity of the household. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a wife's role was integral to the economic and social success of the family. Her industriousness and wisdom ensure that the household is well-provided for, echoing the blessings of a faithful life as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>. The phrase also connects to the idea of spiritual riches, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where true value is found in heavenly treasures.
