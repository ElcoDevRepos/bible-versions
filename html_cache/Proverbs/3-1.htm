In the context of Proverbs, this is often seen as Solomon addressing his son, but it also represents God speaking to His children. This familial language is common in wisdom literature, emphasizing the importance of passing down wisdom through generations. It echoes the relationship between God and Israel, where God refers to Israel as His "firstborn son" (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>).<p><b>do not forget my teaching</b><br>The admonition to "not forget" implies the importance of active remembrance and meditation on God's Word. In ancient Israel, oral tradition was crucial, and teachings were often memorized and recited. This phrase underscores the necessity of internalizing divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to keep God's commandments on their hearts and teach them diligently to their children. Forgetting God's teaching can lead to spiritual decline, as illustrated in the history of Israel's repeated cycles of forgetting and returning to God.<p><b>but let your heart keep my commandments;</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. To "keep" commandments in the heart suggests a deep, internal commitment rather than mere external compliance. This aligns with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. The emphasis on the heart also points to the New Covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people. This foreshadows the work of Christ, who fulfills the law and enables believers to keep God's commandments through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

To all intents and purposes this is a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter, for inasmuch as that described the benefits, spiritual and moral, which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom, in promoting godliness and providing safety from evil companions, so this in like manner depicts the gain flowing from Wisdom, the happiness of the man who finds Wisdom, and the favour which he meets with both with God and man. The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God's afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom. The transition in thought from the former to the latter part of the discourse is easy and natural. Obedience and trust are represented as bringing favour, guidance, and health - in a word, prosperity. But God is not only to be honoured in times of prosperity, but also in adversity his loving hand is to be recognized; and in this submission to his will is true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) serves to externally connect this discourse with the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">Forget not my law.</span> This admonition bears a strong resemblance to that in <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, though the terms employed are somewhat different, <span class="accented">torah</span> and <span class="accented">mits'oth</span> here occupying the place respectively of <span class="accented">musar</span> and <span class="accented">torah</span> in that passage. <span class="accented">My law</span> (<span class="accented">torathi</span>), is literally, <span class="accented">my teaching</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, from the root <span class="accented">yarah</span>, "to teach." The <span class="accented">torah</span> is the whole body of salutary doctrine, and designates "Law" from the standpoint of teaching. Forgetting here is not So much oblivion arising from defective memory, as a wilful disregard and neglect of the admonitions of the teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart</span> (<span class="accented">libekha</span>); Vulgate<span class="accented">, cor</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and so the sum total of the affections. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">yitstsor</span>, from <span class="accented">notsar</span>, "to keep, or observe that which is commanded." The word is of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, and appears about twenty-five times. <span class="cmt_word">My commandments</span> (<span class="accented">mits'othay</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">praecepta mea</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my precepts. The Hebrew verb from which it is derived means "to command, or prescribe." The law and commandments here alluded to are those which immediately follow, from ver. 3 onwards. The three main ideas combined in this verse are remembrance, affection, and obedience. Remembering the law or teaching will depend, to a large extent, on the interest felt in that law; and the admonition to "forget not" is an admonition to give "earnest heed," so that the law or teaching may be firmly fixed in the mind. In using the words, "let thy heart keep," the teacher goes to the root of the matter. There may be an historical remembrance of, or an intellectual assent to, the commandments, but these are insufficient, for the keeping of the commandments must be based on the recognition of the fact that the affections of the heart are to be employed in the service of God, the keeping of the commandments is to be a labour of love. Again, the expression, "keep my commandments," implies, of course, external conformity to their requirements: we are "to observe to do them" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-1.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>); but it implies, further, spiritual obedience, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an obedience with which love is combined (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), and which arises from the inward principles of the heart being in harmony with the spirit of the commandments (see Wardlaw). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">forget</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#353;&#183;k&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7911.htm">Strong's 7911: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mislay, to be oblivious of, from want of memory, attention</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my teaching,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8451.htm">Strong's 8451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Direction, instruction, law</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but let your heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lib&#183;be&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3820.htm">Strong's 3820: </a> </span><span class="str2">The heart, the feelings, the will, the intellect, centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">keep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5341.htm">Strong's 5341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To watch, guard, keep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my commandments;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1466;&#1514;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#7791;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4687.htm">Strong's 4687: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commandment</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:1 My son don't forget my teaching (Prov.
