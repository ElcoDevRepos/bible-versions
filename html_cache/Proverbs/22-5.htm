Thorns and snares are often used in Scripture to symbolize obstacles and dangers (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>). In ancient agricultural societies, thorns represented the curse of the ground and the difficulties of life outside of God's blessing. Snares, on the other hand, were traps used by hunters, symbolizing hidden dangers that can entangle and capture the unwary. The "perverse" refers to those who deviate from the path of righteousness, choosing instead a life of moral corruption and rebellion against divine law. This imagery warns that such a path is fraught with spiritual and moral peril, leading to destruction and separation from God.<p><b>he who guards his soul stays far from them.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the importance of vigilance and self-discipline in maintaining one's spiritual well-being. To "guard" one's soul implies a proactive effort to protect oneself from spiritual harm, akin to a watchman safeguarding a city (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The soul, in biblical terms, represents the essence of a person's being, encompassing their mind, will, and emotions. Staying "far from them" suggests a deliberate choice to avoid the pitfalls associated with a perverse lifestyle. This aligns with the biblical principle of fleeing from sin and pursuing righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>). The verse underscores the necessity of discernment and the pursuit of holiness, echoing the call to be set apart for God's purposes. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the two paths: one leading to life and the other to destruction (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_perverse.htm">The Perverse</a></b><br>This term refers to individuals who deviate from what is considered morally right or good. In the Hebrew text, the word used is (iqqeshim), which implies those who are morally twisted or crooked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the righteous are implied as those who guard their souls and avoid the path of the perverse. They are contrasted with the perverse throughout Proverbs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorns_and_snares.htm">Thorns and Snares</a></b><br>These are metaphorical obstacles and dangers that represent the consequences of a perverse lifestyle.

In <a href="/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a> the hedge of thorns represented the difficulties in the sluggard's path; but here, viewed in connection with the following hemistich, the thorns and snares refer to the hindrances proceeding from the froward, which injuriously affect others; "thorns" being a figure of the pains and troubles, "snares" of the unexpected dangers and impediments which evil men cause as they go on their crooked way.
