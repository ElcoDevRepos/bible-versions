In biblical context, wisdom is highly valued, but true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). A person who considers themselves wise without seeking divine guidance is often blinded by arrogance. This self-perception is dangerous because it closes off the individual from learning and growth. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on humility and the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom. This phrase warns against the folly of self-reliance and the rejection of godly counsel, which is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>, "Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight."<p><b>There is more hope for a fool than for him.</b><br>In the wisdom literature of the Bible, a "fool" is often someone who lacks understanding or moral insight, yet there is still potential for change and redemption. The comparison here is stark; even a fool, who is typically seen as lacking wisdom, has more potential for improvement than someone who is self-satisfied in their own wisdom. This highlights the severity of pride and self-deception. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of repentance and the openness to correction, which is a recurring theme in scripture (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>). The New Testament also reflects this idea in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." The hope for a fool lies in their ability to recognize their need for wisdom, whereas the self-wise are often closed to such realization.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_in_his_own_eyes.htm">The Wise in His Own Eyes</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who is self-assured in their wisdom, often to the point of arrogance. This person is contrasted with the fool, suggesting a deeper level of folly due to their self-deception.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a fool is someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often making poor decisions. However, this verse suggests that even a fool has more hope than someone who is wise in their own eyes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom.

Because a fool may still recognize his need and seek help, he retains a shred of hope; the self-wise man forfeits even that. True hope lies in humble, reverent submission to God&#8217;s wisdom, the only path that keeps hearts teachable and redeemable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit.--</span>Comp. the warnings of <a href="/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another.

Nothing so shuts the door against improvement as self-conceit. "Woe unto them," says Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), "that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight." Such persons, professing themselves wise, become fools (<a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>).

A fool who is conscious of unwisdom may be set right; but one who fancies himself perfect, and needing no improvement, is beyond cure; his case is hopeless. So the sinner who feels and acknowledges his iniquity may be converted; but the self-righteous Pharisee, who considers himself to have no need of repentance, will never be reformed (see Matthew <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>; <a href="/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>). St. Chrysostom (Hom. in Phil.,' 7), "Haughtiness is a great evil; it is better to be a fool than haughty; for in the one case the folly is only a perversion of intellect, but in the other ease it is still worse; for it is folly joined with madness. The fool is an evil to himself; but the haughty man is a plague to others too. One cannot be haughty-minded without being a fool... The soul which is puffed up has a worse disease than dropsy, while that which is under restraint is treed from all evil" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/26-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do you see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1453;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who is wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his own eyes?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - cdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">There is more hope</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tiq&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8615.htm">Strong's 8615: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cord, expectancy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7733;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than for him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;men&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/26-12.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 26:12 Do you see a man wise (Prov.
