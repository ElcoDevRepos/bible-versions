The imagery of an arrow piercing the liver suggests a sudden and fatal blow, symbolizing the consequences of succumbing to temptation. This phrase highlights the deadly nature of sin, echoing the biblical theme that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The arrow represents the inevitable judgment and consequences that follow sinful actions, reminiscent of the swift and certain justice seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>like a bird darting into a snare</b><br>This simile illustrates the naivety and impulsiveness of one who falls into temptation. Birds, often used in biblical literature to symbolize innocence or vulnerability, are unaware of the danger until it is too late. This imagery is consistent with other biblical warnings about the deceptive nature of sin (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). The snare represents the traps set by sin and temptation, which are often hidden and alluring, leading to spiritual entrapment and destruction.<p><b>not knowing it will cost him his life</b><br>This phrase underscores the ignorance and blindness of those who pursue sinful paths. It serves as a warning about the ultimate cost of sin, which is spiritual death and separation from God. This echoes the teachings of Jesus, who warned about the broad path leading to destruction (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). The lack of awareness or understanding of the consequences is a common theme in wisdom literature, emphasizing the need for discernment and the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, representing those who lack wisdom and discernment, easily led astray by temptation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seductress.htm">The Seductress</a></b><br>A metaphor for temptation and sin, personified as a woman who leads the young man astray.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrow.htm">The Arrow</a></b><br>Symbolizes the sudden and deadly consequences of sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_snare.htm">The Snare</a></b><br>Represents the trap of sin, which seems harmless but leads to destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_liver.htm">The Liver</a></b><br>In ancient Hebrew thought, the liver was considered the seat of life, making its piercing a metaphor for mortal danger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often appears harmless or even attractive, but its consequences are severe and life-threatening.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wisdom_and_discernment.htm">The Importance of Wisdom and Discernment</a></b><br>Like the young man, we must seek wisdom to recognize and avoid the snares of temptation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_suddenness_of_consequences.htm">The Suddenness of Consequences</a></b><br>Sin can lead to sudden and unexpected consequences, much like an arrow piercing the liver.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>We must guard our hearts against temptation, understanding that what seems minor can lead to spiritual death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_protection.htm">Seeking God's Protection</a></b><br>Rely on God's wisdom and protection to avoid the snares of sin, as He is our refuge and strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_7_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 7:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_7_23_Ignoring_wisdom_s_peril.htm">How does Proverbs 7:23 warn against the dangers of ignoring wisdom's call?
