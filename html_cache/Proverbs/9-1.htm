In biblical literature, wisdom is often depicted as a divine attribute, reflecting God's order and design in creation. The imagery of building a house implies stability, permanence, and a place of refuge. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a house was not just a physical structure but a symbol of one's life and legacy. This aligns with the biblical theme that wisdom is foundational to a well-ordered life (<a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3-4</a>). The house can also be seen as a metaphor for the community or the people of God, where wisdom establishes a dwelling place for righteousness and truth.<p><b>she has carved out her seven pillars.</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often signifies completeness or perfection, as seen in the seven days of creation (Genesis 1) and the sevenfold Spirit of God (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). The "seven pillars" suggest a structure that is both complete and divinely ordained. In ancient architecture, pillars were essential for supporting large structures, indicating strength and stability. This can be interpreted as the comprehensive nature of wisdom, supporting all aspects of life. Theologically, the seven pillars may represent the fullness of God's wisdom, which is available to those who seek it. Some scholars see a connection to the sevenfold characteristics of wisdom found in <a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, which include purity, peace-loving, and mercy. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), who establishes His church as a house built on the foundation of His teachings (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman, Wisdom is depicted as a master builder, emphasizing her role in creating a stable and structured environment.

It is not an unusual custom in the Old Testament to describe intimate communion with God, and the refreshment which the soul of man thereby receives, under the figure of a festival. Thus in <a href="/exodus/24-11.htm" title="And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.">Exodus 24:11</a>, when the elders of Israel were admitted to the vision of the Almighty, they "did eat and drink." The same idea occurs frequently in the prophets also (as <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed:">Isaiah 65:13</a>; <a href="/context/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7-8</a>); and is brought out in the New Testament with great fulness in the parables of the great supper (Luke 14) and the marriage of the king's son (Matthew 22). Christ, the supreme Wisdom, has "builded His house" by taking man's flesh at His Incarnation, and thus rearing for Himself a "temple of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>); and also by building for Himself a "spiritual house" (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>), "the house of God, which is the church of the living God" (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>). (For references to the Fathers, see Bishop Wordsworth.) In the previous chapter Christ's work as Creator was described; now He is set forth as Regenerator of mankind. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - 15. <span class="accented">Fifteenth admonitory discourse</span>, containing in a parabolic form an invitation of Wisdom (vers. 1-12), and that of her rival Folly (vers. 13-18). The chapter sums up in brief the warnings of the preceding part. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Wisdom was represented as having a house at whose portals persons waited eagerly for admission (<a href="/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>); the idea is further carried on. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom hath builded her house.</span> (For the plural form of <span class="accented">khochmoth</span>, "wisdom," a plural of excellency, see on Proverbs 1:20.) As the "strange woman" in ch. 7. possessed a house to which she seduced her victim, so Wisdom is represented as having a house which she has made and adorned, and to which she invites her pupils. Spiritual writers see here two references - one to Christ's incarnation, when he built for himself a human body (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and another to his work in forming the Church, which is his mystical body (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). And the sublime language used in this section is not satisfied with the bare notion that we have here only an allegorical representation of Wisdom calling followers to her. Rather we are constrained to see a Divine intimation of the office and work of Christ, not only the Creator of the world, as in ch. 8, but its Regenerator. <span class="cmt_word">She hath hewn out her seven pillars</span>. Architecturally, according to Hitzig and others, the pillars of the inner court are meant, which supported the gallery of the first story. Four of these were m the corners, three in the middle of three sides, while the entrance to the court was through the fourth side of the square. The number seven generally denotes perfection; it is the covenant number, expressive of harmony and unity generally, the signature of holiness and blessing, completeness and rest. So in the Apocalypse the whole Church is represented by the number of seven Churches (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, etc.; see on Proverbs 26:16). Wisdom's house is said to be thus founded because of its perfection and adaptability to all states of men. But doubtless there is a reference to the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit, which rested upon the Christ (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.), and which are the support and strength of the Church, being symbolized by the seven-branched candlestick in the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wisdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1453;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2454.htm">Strong's 2454: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wisdom, every wise woman </span><br /><br /><span class="word">has built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her house;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she has carved out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2672.htm">Strong's 2672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut, carve, to hew, split, square, quarry, engrave</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pillars.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1462;&#1443;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5982.htm">Strong's 5982: </a> </span><span class="str2">A column, a stand, platform</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 9:1 Wisdom has built her house (Prov.
