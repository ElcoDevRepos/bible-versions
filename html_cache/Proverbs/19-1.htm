In biblical times, poverty was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor, yet this proverb challenges that notion by highlighting the moral superiority of the poor who maintain their integrity. Integrity, or moral uprightness, is a recurring theme in Proverbs (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9, 11</a>:3) and is highly valued in the biblical narrative. The Hebrew word for "integrity" implies completeness and soundness, suggesting a life lived in accordance with God's laws. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the blessedness of the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>) and the importance of storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>than a fool whose lips are perverse</b><br>The contrast here is with a "fool," a term frequently used in Proverbs to describe someone who rejects wisdom and moral instruction. The fool's "lips are perverse," indicating speech that is corrupt, deceitful, or morally twisted. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, speech was a powerful tool, and perverse speech was seen as a reflection of a corrupt heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The fool's perverse lips can lead to personal ruin and social discord, as words have the power to build up or destroy (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). This phrase warns against the dangers of valuing wealth or status over righteousness, echoing the biblical principle that true wisdom and favor come from God, not from human approval or material success.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_man.htm">The Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who may lack material wealth but possess moral integrity and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who lack wisdom and understanding, often characterized by moral and spiritual folly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which the Proverbs were written, emphasizing wisdom and moral living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_believers.htm">The Community of Believers</a></b><br>The audience for whom the Proverbs were intended, both in ancient times and today, seeking guidance in righteous living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_integrity.htm">Value of Integrity</a></b><br>Integrity is a priceless virtue that surpasses material wealth.

Scripture often measures &#8220;better&#8221; not by wealth, status, or comfort but by moral and spiritual quality (<a href="/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>).

That a rich man is here intended appears likely from the parallel passage in <a href="/proverbs/28-6.htm" title="Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.">Proverbs 28:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is the poor that walkth in his integrity.</span> The word for "poor" is, here and in vers. 7, 22, <span class="accented">rash</span>, which signifies "poor" in opposition to "rich." In the present reading of the second clause, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, there seems to be a failure in antithesis, unless we can understand the fool as a rich fool. This, the repetition of the maxim in <a href="/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a> ("Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich"), would lead one to admit. The Vulgate accordingly has, <span class="accented">Quam dives torquem labia sua, et insipiens</span>, "Than a rich man who is of perverse lips and a fool." With this the Syriac partly agrees. So that, if we take this reading, the moralist says that the poor man who lives a guileless, innocent life, content with his lot, and using no wrong means to improve his fortunes, is happier and better than the rich man who is hypocritical in his words and deceives others, and has won his wealth by such means, thus proving himself to be a fool, a morally bad man. But if we content ourselves with the Hebrew text, we must find the antithesis in the simple, pious, poor man, contrasted with the arrogant rich man, who sneers at his poor neighbour as an inferior creature. The writer would seem to insinuate that there is a natural connection between poverty and integrity of life on the one hand, and wealth and folly on the other. He would assent to the sweeping assertion, <span class="accented">Omnis dives ant iniquus aut iniqui heres</span>, "Every rich man is either a rascal or a rascal's heir." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Better</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a poor man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7326.htm">Strong's 7326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in want or poor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who walks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with integrity</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7791;um&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8537.htm">Strong's 8537: </a> </span><span class="str2">Completeness, integrity, also part of the high priest's breastplate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whose lips</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1437;&#1508;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8193.htm">Strong's 8193: </a> </span><span class="str2">The lip, language, a margin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are perverse.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;iq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6141.htm">Strong's 6141: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twisted, perverted</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/19-1.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 19:1 Better is the poor who walks (Prov.
