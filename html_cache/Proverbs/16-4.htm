This underscores the belief that nothing is random or without divine intention, echoing the wisdom literature's focus on God's control over the cosmos.<p><b>even the wicked for the day of disaster</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the difficult concept of divine justice and the existence of evil. It suggests that even those who oppose God have a role within His sovereign plan. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God uses even the actions of the wicked to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the story of Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>. The "day of disaster" can be understood as a time of judgment, reminiscent of the Day of the Lord described in prophetic books like Joel and Amos. This phrase also points to the ultimate justice of God, where evil will be addressed and rectified, aligning with <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, which describes the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and purposeful creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who live in opposition to God's will, often experiencing consequences for their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_disaster.htm">Day of Disaster</a></b><br>A time of judgment or calamity, often seen as a consequence of wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all creation, and everything serves His divine purpose, even if we do not fully understand it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_in_creation.htm">Purpose in Creation</a></b><br>Every aspect of creation, including those who oppose God, ultimately serves His greater plan and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>The wicked are not outside of God's plan; their actions and the resulting consequences are part of His righteous judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Believers can find comfort in knowing that God has a purpose for everything, encouraging trust in His wisdom and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_righteousness.htm">Call to Righteousness</a></b><br>Understanding the fate of the wicked should motivate believers to pursue righteousness and align with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_16_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 16:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_16_4_God_s_rule_over_all.htm">How does Proverbs 16:4 reveal God's sovereignty over all creation, including the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_for_His_purpose_in_Prov_16_4.htm">What does "for His purpose" in Proverbs 16:4 teach about divine intention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_8_28_to_Proverbs_16_4.htm">How can Romans 8:28 deepen our understanding of Proverbs 16:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_with_God_s_purpose_here.htm">In what ways can we align our lives with God's purpose as seen here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Prov_16_4_on_decisions.htm">How does recognizing God's control in Proverbs 16:4 affect daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_16_4_and_free_will_reconcile.htm">How does Proverbs 16:4 reconcile with the concept of free will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_Prov_16_4_say_God_creates_evil.htm">Does Proverbs 16:4 imply God creates evil for His purposes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_16_4_and_a_loving_God.htm">How does Proverbs 16:4 align with the idea of a loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_proverbs_16_4_imply_god_created_evil.htm">Proverbs 16:4 states God made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for a day of disaster&#8212;doesn&#8217;t this suggest a divine origin for evil, conflicting with the idea of a just and loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_punish_babylon_if_god_used_it.htm">Jeremiah 51:7 calls Babylon a &#8220;golden cup&#8221; in God&#8217;s hand; if God used Babylon, why should the nation be punished? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'fearfully_and_wonderfully_made'.htm">What does "Fearfully and Wonderfully Made" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_a_'cruel_messenger'_fit_a_kind_deity.htm">Proverbs 17:11 describes a &#8220;cruel messenger&#8221; sent against rebels.

Or the passage may be translated, "hath made all for its own end or purpose." The assertion that "He has made the wicked for the day of evil," does not mean that He created any one for punishment--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>predestined him for destruction. It only teaches that even the wicked are subservient to God's eternal purposes; that Pharaoh, for instance, by his rebellion could not change God's plans for the deliverance of His people, but only gave Him an occasion for showing forth His power, justice, goodness, and longsuffering. The "day of evil," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>punishment, at last overtook Pharaoh in accordance with the law and purpose of God that the wicked, if unrepentant, shall be punished, and thereby serve as a warning to others; but God by his longsuffering shewed that He was "not willing" that he should "perish," but rather that he "should come to repentance" (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>). This appears to be also the teaching of St. Paul in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm" title="For the scripture said to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.">Romans 9:17</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath made all things for himself</span>. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter semetipsum</span>; and Origen ('Praef. in Job'), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. That is, God hath made everything for his own purpose, to answer the design which he hath intended from all eternity (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>). But this translation is not in accordance with the present reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which means rather "for its own end," for its own proper use. Everything in God's design has its own end and object and reason for being where it is and such as it is; everything exhibits his goodness and wisdom, and tends to his glory. Septuagint, "All the works of the Lord are with righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span> This clause has been perverted to support the terrible doctrine of reprobation - that God, whose will must be always efficacious, has willed the damnation of some; whereas we are taught that God's will is that "all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth," and that "God sent his Son not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved" (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). Man, having freewill, can reject this gracious purpose of God, and render the means of salvation nugatory; but this does not make God the cause of man's destruction, but man himself. In saying that God "made the wicked," the writer does not mean that God made him as such, but made him as he made all other things, giving him powers and capacities which he might have used to good, but which, as a fact, he uses to evil. It will be useful here to quote the wise words of St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 6:33), "The Just and Merciful One, as he disposes the deeds of mortals, vouchsafes some things in mercy, and permits other things in anger; and the things which he permits he so bears with that he turns them to the account of his purpose. And hence it is brought to pass in a marvellous way that even that which is done without t,e will of God is not contrary to the will of God. For while evil deeds are converted to a good use, the very things that oppose his design render service to his design." <span class="accented">The day of evil</span> is the hour of punishment (<a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>), which by a moral law will inevitably fall upon the sinner. God makes man's wickedness subserve his purposes and manifest his glory, as we see in the case of Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>), and the crucifixion of our blessed Lord (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>). It is a phase of God's moral government that an evil day should be appointed for transgressors, and it is from foreknowledge of their deserts that their punishment is prepared. The perplexing question, why God allows men to come into the world whom he knows will meet with perdition, is not handled here. Septuagint, "But the impious is kept for an evil day."
