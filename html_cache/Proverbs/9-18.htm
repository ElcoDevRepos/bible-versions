In the context of Proverbs, wisdom and folly are often personified as women inviting people to their respective houses. The "dead" here refers to those who have succumbed to folly's temptations, leading to spiritual death. This aligns with the biblical theme that sin leads to death, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The imagery of the dead being present suggests a hidden danger, emphasizing the deceptive nature of sin. The Hebrew word for "dead" can also imply shades or spirits, indicating a realm of spiritual death and separation from God.<p><b>that her guests are in the depths of Sheol</b><br>Sheol in ancient Hebrew culture was understood as the abode of the dead, a shadowy place of silence and forgetfulness. It is not equivalent to the later Christian concept of hell but rather a place where all the dead reside, both righteous and wicked, as seen in <a href="/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13-19</a>. The "depths of Sheol" suggest a profound separation from the living and from God, symbolizing ultimate spiritual ruin. This phrase serves as a warning about the consequences of rejecting wisdom and embracing folly. The imagery of "guests" implies that those who follow folly are not merely passing through but have taken up residence, indicating a settled state of spiritual death. This can be contrasted with the invitation of wisdom, which leads to life and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simple.htm">The Simple</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the simple are those who lack wisdom and discernment.
