In the biblical context, seeking wise counsel is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states that "where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety." The cultural context of ancient Israel valued the wisdom of elders and leaders, who were often consulted for their experience and insight. This practice is evident in the story of Rehoboam in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where the king's failure to heed the advice of experienced counselors led to the division of the kingdom. Theologically, this principle underscores the value of humility and the recognition that human understanding is limited, aligning with the broader biblical teaching that wisdom ultimately comes from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>and wage war under sound guidance</b><br>In ancient times, warfare was a common reality, and the success of military endeavors often depended on strategic planning and wise leadership. This phrase suggests that even in matters of conflict, seeking sound guidance is crucial. The historical context of Israel's battles, such as those led by King David, illustrates the importance of divine guidance and strategic counsel. For instance, David frequently inquired of the Lord before going into battle (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2-4</a>). This principle can be seen as a type of Christ, who is depicted as the ultimate leader and counselor, guiding His people in spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>). The call for sound guidance also reflects the broader biblical narrative that true wisdom and victory come from reliance on God rather than human strength alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The Talmud says, "Even the most prudent of men needs friends' counsels;" and none but the most conceited would deem himself superior to advice, or would fail to allow that, as the Vulgate puts it, <span class="accented">cogitationes consillis roborantur.</span> This is true in all relations of life, in great and small matters alike, in peace, and, as our moralist adds, in war. <span class="cmt_word">With good advice make war;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Gubernaculis tractanda sunt bella</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">By wise guidance make thou war</span>.

It is a maritime metaphor, rightly retained by the Vulgate, and might be rendered "pilotings," "steerings." War is a necessary evil, but it must be undertaken prudently and with a due consideration of circumstances, means, etc. Our Lord illustrates the necessity of due circumspection in following him by the case of a threatened conflict between two contending kings (<a href="/luke/14-31.htm">Luke 14:31</a>, etc.).
