Solomon's proverbs are part of the wisdom literature in the Bible, which includes practical instructions for living a life that honors God. The term "additional" suggests that these proverbs were not included in the earlier collection, possibly due to their later discovery or compilation.<p><b>which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:</b><br>Hezekiah reigned as king of Judah from approximately 715 to 686 BC. He is known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore the worship of Yahweh (<a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18:1-6</a>). The "men of Hezekiah" likely refers to a group of scribes or scholars tasked with preserving and compiling these proverbs. This action reflects the importance placed on maintaining and disseminating wisdom literature during Hezekiah's reign. The historical context of Hezekiah's time was marked by a return to the worship of God and a rejection of idolatry, aligning with the themes of wisdom and righteousness found in Proverbs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and writings, including many of the Proverbs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>A king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God, Hezekiah initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.

The reader moves from mainly individual couplets (chapters 10&#8211;24) to many vivid contrasts and practical word pictures (chapters 25&#8211;29), reminding us that God&#8217;s wisdom is inexhaustible and still relevant (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>Applications:<p>&#8211; Expect new insights even if you have long studied Proverbs; God always has &#8220;additional&#8221; light for obedient hearts (<a href="/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a>).<p>&#8211; Trust the completeness and sufficiency of Scripture.

To his care we probably also owe the compilation of Books II. (Psalms 42-72) and III. (73-89) of the Psalter, in the former of which are included several psalms of David's which had not found a place in Book I., though this last-named book consists almost, if not entirely, of psalms ascribed to him. In the same manner the present book (Proverbs 25-29) contains proverbs of Solomon which apparently were not known to the compiler of the previous collection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 29.</span> - Part VI.

But there was still a large number of proverbial sayings attributed to Solomon, and preserved partly by oral tradition and partly in writing, which it was advisable to collect and secure before they were lost. The zeal of Hezekiah took this in hand. He was not, as far as we know, an author himself, but he evidently felt a warm interest in literature, and "the men of Hezekiah," not mentioned elsewhere, must have been his counsellors and scholars, to whom was entrusted the duty of gathering together into a volume the scattered sayings of the wise king. Among those contemporaries, doubtless, Isaiah was eminent, and it is not improbable that Shebna the scribe and Josh the chronicler were members of the learned fraternity (<a href="/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>). The verb rightly translated "copied out" (<span class="accented">athak</span>) means, properly, "to remove," "to transfer" from one place to another (<span class="accented">transtulerunt</span>, Vulgate); hence it signifies here to copy into a book words taken from other writings or people's mouths. The sayings thus collected, whether truly Solomon's or not, were extant under his name, and were regarded as worthy of his reputation for wisdom. The title is given in the Septuagint, thus: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.
