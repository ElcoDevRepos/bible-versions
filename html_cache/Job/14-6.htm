In the context of the Book of Job, Job is enduring immense trials and feels overwhelmed by God's scrutiny. This request echoes the human desire for relief from divine judgment or testing. Biblically, the idea of God "looking away" can be seen in other scriptures where individuals seek mercy or respite, such as in <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>, where David asks God to look away so he may have peace before he departs.<p><b>and let him rest</b><br>Job desires rest from his afflictions, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. Rest is often associated with peace and relief from labor or suffering. In the Old Testament, the Sabbath is a day of rest, symbolizing God's rest after creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus offers rest to those who are weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), indicating a deeper spiritual rest found in Him. Job's request for rest highlights the universal human need for physical and spiritual respite.<p><b>so he can enjoy his day</b><br>The notion of enjoying one's day suggests a temporary reprieve from life's hardships. In the ancient Near Eastern context, life was often harsh and labor-intensive, making moments of enjoyment particularly precious. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12-13</a> speaks to the idea that finding joy in one's labor is a gift from God. Job's desire to enjoy his day underscores the fleeting nature of life and the importance of finding joy amidst suffering.<p><b>as a hired hand</b><br>The comparison to a hired hand emphasizes the temporary and often difficult nature of human life. In biblical times, hired hands were laborers who worked for daily wages, often without the security or benefits of permanent employment. This imagery reflects the transient and toilsome aspects of life, as seen in Jesus' parable of the workers in the vineyard (<a href="/matthew/20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>), where hired workers are paid for their day's labor. Job's analogy highlights the brevity and toil of human existence, echoing the broader biblical theme of life as a temporary journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The request does not deny God&#8217;s omniscience; Job is asking for a pause in corrective scrutiny, much as David did in <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>, &#8220;Turn Your gaze from me, that I may again be cheered.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier, Job voiced the same longing (<a href="/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; 10:20). Scripture records this literally, showing us a righteous man wrestling honestly with suffering while still acknowledging God as Judge (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also echoes God&#8217;s measured dealings with mankind: &#8220;For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>). The Lord&#8217;s look can wound or heal; Job seeks a season of the latter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and let him rest</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rest&#8221; here is relief from relentless pain, a respite God alone can grant.<p>&#8226; Rest is a divine gift throughout Scripture: <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a> sets the precedent; <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a> promises, &#8220;My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus later extends the same offer, &#8220;Come to Me&#8230; and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Job&#8217;s cry anticipates that gospel comfort.<p>&#8226; Physical rest pictures spiritual refreshment. Even in trial, believers &#8220;do not lose heart&#8221; because &#8220;our inner self is being renewed day by day&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so he can enjoy his day</b><p>&#8226; Job asks not for luxury but for a single day&#8217;s simple pleasure&#8212;ordinary, God-given joys that suffering had eclipsed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a> commends such modest enjoyment as a gift from God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a> prays, &#8220;Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.&#8221; Job longs for that song again, even if briefly.<p>&#8226; The request underlines life&#8217;s brevity (<a href="/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1-2</a>). When God allows gladness within fleeting days, it magnifies His mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a hired hand</b><p>&#8226; A hired laborer works under fixed limits: a set task, a defined wage, and an end-of-day release (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Job previously compared himself to such a worker: &#8220;Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired worker?&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture stresses both hardship and hope. A laborer toils, yet expects completion and payment. Likewise, Job believes his suffering has an appointed boundary and that God, the just Master, will settle accounts (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking to &#8220;enjoy his day,&#8221; Job seeks the brief satisfaction a laborer feels when the sun sets and wages are secured&#8212;an assurance that toil is not endless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a> records a faithful man imploring God for temporary relief. He asks the Almighty to look away for a moment, grant restorative rest, permit a taste of daily joy, and treat him like a hired hand whose toil has a clear endpoint. The verse affirms God&#8217;s sovereignty over human limits, the legitimacy of seeking mercy within those limits, and the promise that our labor and suffering are measured by a just and compassionate Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Accomplish.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">have pleasure in; rejoice at the day when his wages are paid him. </span>Job had used the same image before (<a href="/job/7-2.htm" title="As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an hireling looks for the reward of his work:">Job 7:2</a>). Job now proceeds to enlarge on the mortality of man, comparing him, as is so often done in all literature, to the vegetable produce of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22</a>); with this difference, however--that a tree will sprout again when it is cut down, but even a strong man succumbs to death.

"Then he will be able to have a breathing-time, an interval of peace and rest, before his departure from the earth." What Job had previously desired for himself (<a href="/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>) he now asks for all humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day</span>.

God's vegetable creation is better off, in respect of length of days, than man. Let a tree be cut down, it is not therefore of necessity destroyed. There is yet hope for it. The bare dry stump will sometimes put forth tender branches, which will grow and flourish, and renew the old life. Or, if the stump be quite dead, suckers may spring up from the root and grow into new trees as vigorous as the one that they replace (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). Herodotus considered that all trees had this recuperative power, except the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, a species of fir (Herod., 6:37), and the traveller Shaw says that when a palm tree dies there is always a sucker ready to take its place. Pliny also observes of the laurel, "Viva-cissima est radix, ita ut, si truncus ina-ruerit, recisa arbor mox laetius frutificet" ('Hist. Nat.,' 1:15. &sect; 30). <span class="cmt_word">That it will sprout again</span>. That is, from the spool or stump. Some trees, as the Spanish chest. nut, if cut down flush with the ground, throw up shoots from the entire circle of the stomp, often as many as fifteen or twenty. <span class="cmt_word">And that the tender branch thereof will not cease</span>. The vigour of such shoots is very great. In a few years they grow to the height of the parent tree. If they are then removed they are quickly replaced by a fresh growth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/14-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">look away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8159.htm">Strong's 8159: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze at, about, to inspect, consider, compassionate, be nonplussed, bewildered</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
