In the context of Job, it reflects the belief that God rescues the faithful from suffering. The "jaws of distress" metaphorically represents extreme danger or hardship, akin to being trapped by a predator. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is depicted as a deliverer, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, where God brings the psalmist into a "broad place" after rescuing him. Historically, the idea of divine rescue is prevalent in the Ancient Near East, where gods were often seen as protectors of their people.<p><b>to a spacious and broad place</b><br>This phrase signifies freedom and relief after a period of confinement or oppression. In biblical terms, a "spacious place" often symbolizes safety and abundance, contrasting with the narrowness of distress. This imagery is used in <a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>, where God sets the psalmist's feet in a "broad place." Theologically, it can be seen as a type of the spiritual freedom found in Christ, who offers liberation from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p><b>to a table full of richness</b><br>The "table full of richness" symbolizes provision and blessing. In the ancient world, a table laden with food was a sign of prosperity and divine favor. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where God prepares a table before the psalmist in the presence of his enemies, indicating protection and abundance. Culturally, sharing a meal was a significant act of fellowship and covenant, pointing to the ultimate fellowship believers have with God through Christ, as seen in the eschatological banquet described in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through severe trials, including loss of wealth, health, and family.

The verb &#8220;drew&#8221; pictures a deliberate, personal action&#8212;God leaning in and taking hold.<p>- Scripture consistently portrays the Lord as the One who reaches first:<p>&#8226; &#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;He lifted me up from the pit of destruction&#8230; He set my feet upon a rock&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>).<p>- Elihu&#8217;s point: despite Job&#8217;s pain, God has not been passive; He has already been at work, pulling His servant toward deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the jaws of distress</b><p>- The &#8220;jaws&#8221; image suggests danger ready to snap shut. Job&#8217;s losses felt like a predator&#8217;s bite&#8212;swift, crushing, inescapable.<p>- God specializes in extraction from such moments:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In my distress I called upon the LORD&#8230; He heard my voice&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p>- Even when suffering seems relentless, God&#8217;s track record guarantees that distress does not have the final say.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to a spacious and broad place</b><p>- Rescued people are not left in cramped survival mode; God ushers them into breathing room.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;You have set my feet in the open&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>).<p>- The wide place represents restored freedom, renewed perspective, and fresh opportunity&#8212;evidence that God&#8217;s salvation is generous, not minimal.<p>- Jesus echoes the theme: &#8220;I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to a table full of richness</b><p>- The imagery shifts from space to sustenance.

Elihu may be speaking, not of what God would have done, but of what He has actually done: "Yea, also He hath removed thee from the mouth of an adversary, even case and abundance in the place of which there was no straitness, and that which came down upon thy table full of fatness; but thou art full of the judgment of the wicked, therefore justice and judgment take hold on thee." "God, in His mercy, saw that thou wast in danger, and He removed the cause of temptation, and thy chastisement would have been of short duration hadst thou been submissive and resigned; but thou hast been bold and daring, like the wicked, and hast reaped the judgment of the wicked."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad pine, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness</span>. Another quite different interpretation has been proposed by Ewald, and adopted by Dillmann and Canon Cook, who suppose Elihu to speak, not of what would have happened to Job under certain circumstances, but of what had actually happened to him, and render, "Thee moreover hath thy unbounded prosperity seduced from listening to the voice of affliction, and the case of thy table which was full of fatness." But the rendering of the Authorized Version, which is substantially that of Schultens and Rosenmuller, is still upheld by many scholars, and has been retained by our Revisers. If we adopt it, we must understand Elihu as assuring Job that he too would have been delivered and restored to his prosperity, if he had accepted his afflictions in a proper <span class="accented">spirits</span> and learnt the lesson they were intended to teach him (see vers. 9, 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/36-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
