In the context of Job, it reflects Job's argument against his friends, emphasizing that even the creatures of the earth understand the sovereignty and wisdom of God, which his friends fail to grasp. The Bible often uses animals to convey lessons or truths, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a>, where the ant is used as an example of diligence. The idea that creation itself can instruct humanity is echoed in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where Paul states that God's invisible qualities are evident in the world He has made.<p><b>ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.</b><br>Birds are often used in Scripture to symbolize freedom, provision, and divine care, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, where Jesus points out that the birds do not sow or reap, yet God feeds them. This phrase reinforces the idea that the natural world is a testament to God's order and wisdom. In ancient Near Eastern culture, birds were sometimes seen as messengers or omens, but here they are portrayed as witnesses to God's creation. The use of birds in this context highlights the accessibility of divine wisdom through observation of the natural world, a theme that resonates with the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as in the Psalms and Proverbs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
