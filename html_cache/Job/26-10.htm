The "horizon" signifies God's sovereign control over creation, marking the limits of the earth and the sky. In <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-10</a>, God separates the waters and establishes the dry land, demonstrating His authority over the natural order. The imagery of God inscribing or marking the horizon suggests intentionality and precision in creation, emphasizing His role as the divine architect. This also connects to <a href="/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, where wisdom is present when God "drew a circle on the face of the deep," highlighting the order and structure God brings to the universe.<p><b>at the boundary between light and darkness</b><br>This phrase underscores the separation of light and darkness, a theme that begins in <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3-4</a>, where God creates light and distinguishes it from darkness. This boundary is not just physical but also symbolic of moral and spiritual realities. Light often represents God's presence, truth, and righteousness, while darkness symbolizes chaos, evil, and ignorance. In <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it, pointing to Christ as the light of the world. The boundary between light and darkness also foreshadows the ultimate separation of good and evil at the end of time, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23-25</a>, where the New Jerusalem is illuminated by the glory of God, and there is no night. This separation is a testament to God's power and His ultimate plan for redemption and order in creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.
