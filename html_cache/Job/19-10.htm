In the context of the Book of Job, Job feels besieged by his suffering, as if God is dismantling his life from all angles. This imagery of being torn down is reminiscent of a city under siege, a common occurrence in the ancient Near East, where cities were often attacked and destroyed by invading armies. Theologically, this reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and the mysterious nature of His will, as Job struggles to understand why he, a righteous man, is experiencing such devastation. This phrase can be connected to other biblical instances where individuals feel overwhelmed by divine judgment or testing, such as in <a href="/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>, where the author feels trapped and besieged by God.<p><b>until I am gone</b><br>Job expresses a sense of total annihilation, feeling as though he is being reduced to nothing. This reflects the depth of his despair and the completeness of his suffering. Historically, the concept of being "gone" or "destroyed" would resonate with the ancient understanding of death and Sheol, the abode of the dead, where existence is shadowy and insubstantial. This phrase underscores the existential crisis Job faces, questioning the meaning of life and righteousness in the face of suffering. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of hope beyond death, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-55</a>, where death is ultimately defeated through Christ.<p><b>He uproots my hope like a tree</b><br>The imagery of uprooting a tree is powerful, symbolizing the complete removal of stability and life. In the ancient world, trees were often symbols of life, strength, and endurance. To uproot a tree is to destroy its ability to grow and thrive, much like Job feels his hope has been destroyed. This metaphor highlights the depth of Job's despair, as hope is a central theme in the human experience and spiritual life. Biblically, hope is often associated with trust in God's promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. Job's lament here contrasts with the hope found in Christ, who is described as the "root of Jesse" in <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, symbolizing the ultimate source of hope and restoration for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job is not accusing random fate; he knows the Almighty directs even painful seasons (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-23.htm">Psalm 102:23</a>, &#8220;He has weakened my strength in the way; He has shortened my days&#8221;).<p>&#8226;The verb &#8220;tears&#8221; pictures deliberate, powerful demolition, like a house dismantled board by board.<p>&#8226;This keeps us from softening the scene. Job&#8217;s suffering is real, and Scripture records it without airbrushing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on every side</b><p>Nothing is left untouched. Job feels surrounded, hemmed in, with no place of refuge (<a href="/lamentations/3-5.htm">Lamentations 3:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-3.htm">Psalm 109:3</a>).<p>&#8226;The enemy is not Satan in Job&#8217;s line of sight; instead, Job sees the sovereign hand of God allowing&#8212;not preventing&#8212;the losses.<p>&#8226;Believers today can recall Paul&#8217;s similar language: &#8220;We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). Pressed, yes; destroyed, no.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until I am gone</b><p>Job senses that the process will not stop short of total collapse (<a href="/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-6.htm">2 Samuel 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226;It feels final: &#8220;until I am gone.&#8221; But faith knows feelings are not the finish line.<p>&#8226;Even when human endurance seems exhausted, God still writes the final chapter (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He uproots my hope</b><p>Hope, once firmly planted, is now pictured as yanked out of the soil (<a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>; <a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>).<p>&#8226;Job&#8217;s earlier words about hope in a felled tree (<a href="/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7&#8211;9</a>) make this line even sharper. The hope that once sprouted is now lying exposed, roots drying in the sun.<p>&#8226;The honest admission: &#8220;My hope is gone.&#8221; The hidden reality: hope&#8217;s true root remains in God, not in circumstances (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a tree</b><p>The metaphor makes the grief vivid. A tree is living, growing, shading, fruitful&#8212;until a violent pull uproots it (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226;Job sees himself as that tree. Nothing green remains; everything lies flat.<p>&#8226;Yet Scripture elsewhere promises that the righteous are &#8220;like a tree planted by streams of water&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). The contrast heightens the tension: Which picture will ultimately prove true?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/19-10.htm">Job 19:10</a> captures a believer&#8217;s deepest valley&#8212;God seems to be the demolisher, surrounding, exhausting, and uprooting every visible hope. Job&#8217;s words are raw but not faithless; they record reality while leaving room for God to reveal the greater reality still to come. The verse reminds us that when every outward support is stripped away, the Lord Himself remains, ready to replant and rebuild in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone</span>; or, <span class="accented">broken me down.</span> Job compares himself to a city, the walls of which are attacked on every side and broken down.
