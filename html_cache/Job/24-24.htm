In the context of Job, it speaks to the temporary prosperity of the wicked, a recurring theme throughout the book. The brevity of their exaltation is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>, where the wicked flourish like a green tree but soon vanish. This highlights the biblical principle that earthly glory is fleeting and ultimately subject to God's sovereign judgment.<p><b>then they are gone</b><br>The sudden disappearance of the wicked underscores the inevitability of divine justice. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God will not allow injustice to prevail indefinitely. The imagery here can be connected to the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where sudden death renders earthly wealth meaningless. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability before God.<p><b>they are brought low and gathered up like all others</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the common fate of all humanity, regardless of status. The idea of being "brought low" suggests humility imposed by divine intervention, while "gathered up" can be seen as a metaphor for death. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a> echoes this sentiment, stating that all return to dust. It reflects the biblical truth that death is the great equalizer, bringing both the righteous and the wicked to the same end.<p><b>they are cut off like heads of grain</b><br>The agricultural metaphor of being "cut off like heads of grain" illustrates the sudden and decisive nature of God's judgment. This imagery is consistent with prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>, where the reaping of grain symbolizes divine retribution. It also foreshadows the final judgment, as seen in <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>, where the harvest represents the separation of the righteous from the wicked. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the ultimate accountability before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In this context, Job is speaking about the wicked who seem to prosper temporarily but ultimately face judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_uz.htm">The Land of Uz</a></b><br>The setting of the Book of Job, traditionally considered to be in the region of Edom or northern Arabia.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The overarching theme of divine justice and the eventual downfall of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_imagery.htm">Harvest Imagery</a></b><br>The metaphor of being "cut off like heads of grain" symbolizes the inevitable judgment and removal of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_exaltation.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Exaltation</a></b><br>Earthly success and exaltation are fleeting.

First, it comes on them when they have risen to eminence, have gained themselves a reputation, and "are exalted." Next, it is sudden and painless, preceded by no long, lingering illness, but just a sinking into non-existence; a tranquil passing away. Thirdly, it is at a ripe age, when they have reached the full term of human life, and are as ears of corn ripe for the harvest.

We may gather from this expression that the reaping in the land of Uz was conducted in Job's time much in the same way as it was in Egypt under the early Pharaohs, viz. by cutting the stalk with a sharp sickle almost immediately below the ear, and collecting the ears in baskets (see the author's 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162;
