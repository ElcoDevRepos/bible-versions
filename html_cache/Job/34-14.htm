In the context of the Book of Job, it underscores God's ultimate control over creation and life itself. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of will and decision-making. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>, which speaks of the plans of the Lord standing firm forever. It emphasizes that God&#8217;s actions are deliberate and purposeful, reflecting His divine wisdom and authority.<p><b>and withdraw His Spirit and breath,</b><br>The Spirit and breath of God are often synonymous with life itself, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. The withdrawal of His Spirit and breath implies the cessation of life, highlighting God's role as the sustainer of all living things. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, where the spirit returns to God who gave it. Theologically, this underscores the dependency of all creation on God for existence and sustenance.

The verse magnifies God&#8217;s sovereignty, underscores human dependence, and calls for thankful, humble trust in the Sustainer of all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">If he set his heart upon man.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">upon himself. </span>It is ambiguous: and so, likewise, the next clause is. We must either regard it as the consequence of the former one--"If He set His heart upon Himself, had regard to His own interest, then He would gather unto Himself His own spirit and His own breath"--or we must do as some do: supply the "if" at the beginning of it, and read it as in the Authorised Version. In this sense, the setting His heart upon man would mean in a bad sense--to do him injury. In doing him injury He would, in fact, injure His own. The effect of His setting His heart on man would be that all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to his dust; but then God would have injured His own, and not another's, in so doing. It is hardly possible that the writer of this last clause should have been ignorant of <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>.

Two renderings are proposed, both supported By about equal authority: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "If he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) set his heart upon <span class="accented">himself</span>, if he should gather to himself <span class="accented">his own</span> spirit, and breath," then all flesh would perish, etc. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "If he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God] set his heart upon [or, 'against'] <span class="accented">man</span>, if he were to gather to himself man's spirit and man's breath," then, etc. The difference is not great. God could, either by withdrawing from man the breath and spirit which he has given him, or simply by withholding from man the quickening and sustaining influences which he is perpetually putting forth, reduce all humankind to nothingness. Being so completely master of man, he would surely not condescend to treat him with injustice. Injustice implies something of opposition, struggle, rivalry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/34-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He were to set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(lib&#183;b&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
