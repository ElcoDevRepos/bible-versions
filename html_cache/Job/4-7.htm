It suggests urgency and importance, urging the listener to think deeply about the matter at hand. In the context of Job, Eliphaz is speaking, and his plea is rooted in the belief that suffering is a result of sin. This reflects the wisdom literature's emphasis on contemplation and understanding, as seen in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.<p><b>Who, being innocent, has ever perished?</b><br>Eliphaz implies that the innocent do not suffer destruction, a common belief in ancient Near Eastern thought. This reflects the retributive justice theology prevalent in the Old Testament, where righteousness leads to blessing and wickedness to punishment. However, the book of Job challenges this notion, as Job is described as blameless and upright (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). This question also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, the truly innocent one who perished for the sins of humanity, highlighting the complexity of divine justice.<p><b>Or where have the upright been destroyed?</b><br>This rhetorical question assumes that the upright are protected by God, aligning with the covenantal promises found in Deuteronomy, where obedience leads to protection and prosperity. However, Job's experience contradicts this assumption, as he suffers despite his righteousness. This tension is explored throughout the book, inviting readers to consider the mystery of God's ways. The ultimate fulfillment of the upright not being destroyed is seen in the resurrection of Jesus, who, though destroyed in death, was raised to life, affirming the hope of eternal justice and vindication for the righteous.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, who experiences severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up questioning Job's integrity and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/teman.htm">Teman</a></b><br>A region in Edom, known for its wise men, from which Eliphaz hails.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dialogue.htm">The Dialogue</a></b><br>This verse is part of the first speech by Eliphaz, who suggests that suffering is a result of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavenly_court.htm">The Heavenly Court</a></b><br>The backdrop of Job's trials, where God allows Satan to test Job's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Eliphaz's perspective reflects a common belief that suffering is always a result of sin.

Scripture does present this as a normal pattern, yet the broader biblical witness&#8212;and Job&#8217;s own experience&#8212;shows that righteous believers can face severe trials without forfeiting God&#8217;s favor. Earthly circumstances may temporarily contradict the pattern, but the Lord&#8217;s final verdict ensures that the innocent do not perish eternally and the upright are never ultimately destroyed. <a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7</a> therefore invites careful reflection on God&#8217;s justice, reminding us that present suffering never nullifies the sure promise of ultimate deliverance for those who walk with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) Re<span class= "bld">member, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?</span>--He challenges Job's experience, and quotes his own in proof of the universal connection between sin and suffering. In so doing, his object may be to insinuate that Job is sinful; or, as seems perhaps more probable, and certainly more gracious, to prove to him that if he is what he was supposed to be, that itself is a ground of hope, inasmuch as no innocent person is allowed to perish. He utters here a half-truth, which, however, is after all true, inasmuch as God will never <span class= "ital">fail, </span>though He may <span class= "ital">try, </span>those who trust in Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?</span> The heart of the matter is now approached. Job is called upon to "remember" the long-established moral axiom, that only evil-doing brings down upon men calamities, and that therefore, where calamities fall, them must be precedent wickedness. If he does not admit this, he-is challenged to bring forward examples, or even a single example, of suffering innocence. If he does admit it, he is left to apply the axiom to himself<span class="cmt_word">. Or where were the righteous cut off?</span> Was the example of "righteous Abel" (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>) unknown to Eliphaz? And had he really never seen that noblest of all sights, the good man struggling with adversity? One would imagine it impossible to attain old age, in the world wherein we live, without becoming convinced by our own observation that good and evil, prosperity and adversity, are not distributed in this life according to moral desert; but a preconceived notion of what ought to have been seems here, as elsewhere so often in the field of speculation, to have blinded men to the actual facts of the case, and driven them to invent explanations of the facts, which militated against their theories, of the most absurdly artificial character. To account for the sufferings of the righteous, the explanation of "secret sins" was introduced, and it was argued that, where affliction seemed to fall on the good man, his goodness was not real goodness - it was a counterfeit, a sham - the fabric of moral excellence, so fair to view, was honeycombed by secret vices, to which the seemingly good man was a prey. Of course, if the afflictions wore abnormal, extraordinary, then the secret sins must be of a most heinous and horrible kind to deserve such a terrible retribution. This is what Eliphaz hints to be the solution in Job's case. God has seen his secret sins - he has "set them in the light of his countenance" (<a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>) - and is punishing them openly. Job's duty is to humble himself before God, to confess, repent, and amend. Then, and then only, may he hope that God will remove his hand, and put an end to his sufferings <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Consider</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has perished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6.htm">Strong's 6: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wander away, lose oneself, to perish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he was innocent?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;q&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5355.htm">Strong's 5355: </a> </span><span class="str2">Clean, free from, exempt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Or where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1465;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_375.htm">Strong's 375: </a> </span><span class="str2">What place?, when?, how?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were the upright</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><br /><span class="word">destroyed?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7733;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3582.htm">Strong's 3582: </a> </span><span class="str2">To secrete, by act, word, to destroy</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/4-7.htm">OT Poetry: Job 4:7 Remember now whoever perished being innocent?
