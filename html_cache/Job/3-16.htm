The imagery of being "hidden like a stillborn child" reflects the cultural understanding of death and birth in the ancient Near East, where stillbirths were seen as tragic but also as a form of escape from the suffering of life. This sentiment is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3-5</a>, where a stillborn child is described as having more rest than someone who lives a long life without fulfillment. Job's lament highlights the depth of his despair and the intensity of his suffering, which is a central theme throughout the book.<p><b>like an infant who never sees daylight?</b><br>The reference to an infant who never sees daylight emphasizes the idea of never experiencing the trials and tribulations of life. In biblical times, light often symbolizes life, knowledge, and divine presence, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, where light is associated with life and the overcoming of darkness. Job's wish to have never seen daylight underscores his desire to have been spared the pain and anguish he is enduring. This longing for non-existence can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's promise of eternal life and rest in Christ, where believers are assured of a future without suffering (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). Job's struggle and his questioning of existence foreshadow the ultimate redemption and hope found in Jesus Christ, who offers light and life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job is wishing he had remained there, untouched by the hardships now crushing him.<p>&#8226; Similar cries surface elsewhere: <a href="/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17&#8211;18</a> and <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a> both speak of being hidden from trouble, revealing that even the most faithful believers can long for escape when pain overwhelms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a stillborn child</b><p>&#8226; A stillborn baby never breathes the air of a broken world; Job pictures that as preferable to a life dominated by loss.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3&#8211;5</a> uses the same comparison, calling a stillborn &#8220;more rest&#8221; than a man who lives long yet finds no satisfaction. Job&#8217;s lament follows that line of thought, measuring earthly suffering against the quiet of the grave.<p>&#8226; The Bible regards every unborn life as real life (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13&#8211;16</a>), so Job&#8217;s analogy underscores the value and personhood of the child even while he envies its untouched rest. Suffering does not negate life&#8217;s worth, but it can distort our perspective when grief is raw.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like an infant who never sees daylight</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Daylight&#8221; represents conscious experience and all that comes with it&#8212;joys and sorrows alike (<a href="/job/3-9.htm">Job 3:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>). Job, sitting in ashes (<a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), sees only the sorrows.<p>&#8226; He yearns for the unawareness of an infant who never opens its eyes, paralleling his earlier wish for darkness to blot out the day of his birth (<a href="/job/3-4.htm">Job 3:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture later testifies that God&#8217;s presence reaches even into the depths of Sheol (<a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>) and that He will one day &#8220;wipe away every tear&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). Job&#8217;s cry, though sincere, is not the final word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a> records a wounded man asking why he could not have remained hidden in the womb, spared from a life that now feels unbearable. By comparing himself to a stillborn child and an infant who never sees daylight, Job voices the universal question of why God permits suffering. The verse candidly reveals human frailty yet also points, through its very honesty, to the need for a Redeemer who holds life and death in His hands (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Untimely birth.</span>--Another condition which would have relieved him from the experience of suffering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light</span>. This is added as another way in which Job might have escaped his misery.
