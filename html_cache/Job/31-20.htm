In Job's time, providing for the needy was a moral obligation, and those who received help would often express gratitude and blessings. The heart blessing someone indicates genuine appreciation and acknowledgment of kindness. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which states that kindness to the poor is akin to lending to the Lord, emphasizing the spiritual significance of such acts.<p><b>for warming him</b><br>The act of providing warmth is a basic yet profound expression of care and compassion. In the harsh climates of the ancient Near East, warmth was essential for survival, especially during cold nights. This phrase underscores the practical aspects of charity, where meeting physical needs is a direct way to show love and concern for others. It echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where caring for the least of these is equated with serving Christ Himself.<p><b>with the fleece of my sheep</b><br>Sheep were a valuable asset in ancient times, providing wool, meat, and milk. The fleece, in particular, was used for making clothing and blankets, essential for warmth. Job's mention of using his own sheep's fleece highlights his personal involvement and sacrifice in helping others. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where one's resources are used to serve and bless others, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>, which encourages the rich to be generous and willing to share. The imagery of sheep also connects to Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who provides for and protects His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Scripture consistently treats the heart as the place where genuine gratitude and testimony arise (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-10.htm">Deuteronomy 15:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). Job is saying that the person&#8217;s very heart&#8212;and not merely polite words&#8212;would bear witness to his generosity. When &#8220;whoever sees his brother in need yet closes his heart against him&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), compassion has failed; Job asserts the opposite.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has not blessed me</b><p>In Old Testament culture, spoken blessing was a public acknowledgment of kindness. <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a> notes that &#8220;he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a> echoes the same principle of reciprocal blessing. Job implies that those he served offered heartfelt thanks, further confirming his integrity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for warming him</b><p>The specific need addressed is warmth&#8212;one of life&#8217;s most basic necessities. <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> highlights true righteousness as &#8220;sharing your bread with the hungry and bringing the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, covering him.&#8221; Jesus later affirms this standard: &#8220;I was naked and you clothed Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>). Job met this tangible need, demonstrating love in action rather than in words only (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the fleece of my sheep</b><p>Job did not give leftovers; he used the finest material available to him. Owning large flocks (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), he sheared his own sheep so the poor could have sturdy, warm garments. This mirrors <a href="/deuteronomy/24-13.htm">Deuteronomy 24:13</a>, where returning a cloak enables a poor man to &#8220;sleep in his own cloak and bless you.&#8221; Job willingly parted with valuable resources, embodying the call of <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> to withhold no good thing when it is in one&#8217;s power to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a> is part of his solemn oath declaring innocence. He testifies that the poor he clothed offered genuine, heartfelt blessing because he provided real warmth from his own flock&#8217;s wool.
