In ancient Hebrew thought, Sheol was a shadowy place where the dead resided, not necessarily a place of punishment but a state of existence apart from the living. Job's plea reflects his deep suffering and desire for relief, even if it means temporary death. This longing for concealment in Sheol highlights the intensity of his anguish and his hope for eventual vindication. The concept of Sheol is also seen in other Old Testament passages, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, where it is depicted as a place of waiting.<p><b>and conceal me until Your anger has passed!</b><br>Job wishes for concealment until God's anger subsides, indicating his belief that his suffering is a result of divine displeasure. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine retribution, where suffering was often seen as a consequence of divine wrath. Job's request for concealment suggests a hope for reconciliation and restoration once God's anger has abated. This theme of divine anger and subsequent restoration is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>, where God promises to gather His people after a period of anger.<p><b>If only You would appoint a time for me</b><br>Here, Job expresses a desire for God to set a specific time for his restoration. This reflects a belief in God's sovereignty and control over time and events. Job's request for an appointed time indicates his hope for a future resolution to his suffering. The idea of God appointing times and seasons is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<p><b>and then remember me!</b><br>Job's plea for God to remember him signifies a hope for divine intervention and restoration. In biblical terms, for God to "remember" someone often implies action on their behalf, as seen in <a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>, where God remembers Noah and acts to end the flood. Job's request for remembrance is a cry for God to act in mercy and restore him to a state of favor. This longing for divine remembrance is a common theme in the Psalms, where the psalmists often ask God to remember them in their affliction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering. In this verse, Job is expressing a deep longing for relief from his suffering and a hope for future restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the realm of the dead, a place of waiting. Job's mention of Sheol reflects his desire for a temporary escape from his suffering, not a final end.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_anger.htm">God's Anger</a></b><br>Job perceives his suffering as a result of God's anger or judgment.

He pictures Sheol, the realm of the dead, as a hiding place crafted by God Himself.<p>&#8226; Job acknowledges that &#8220;If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Jonah who prayed &#8220;From the belly of Sheol I cried for help, and You heard my voice&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-2.htm">Jonah 2:2</a>), Job believes God&#8217;s presence reaches even the grave.<p>&#8226; By asking God to hide him, Job shows faith that the Lord rules over death as surely as life (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>).<p>So, Job&#8217;s request springs from confidence in God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty and care, even when he can&#8217;t feel it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and conceal me until Your anger has passed!</b><p>Job interprets his suffering as the heat of divine anger and pleads for temporary concealment until that wrath subsides.<p>&#8226; Scripture confirms that God&#8217;s anger toward His children is real yet momentary: &#8220;For His anger is but for a moment, His favor for a lifetime&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah echoes this hope: &#8220;For in a very little while My indignation will be spent&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>) and &#8220;With everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Job trusts that God&#8217;s justice and compassion are perfectly balanced; the anger will end, mercy will dawn.<p>He is not trying to escape God, but to be tucked safely away by Him until the righteous storm is over.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If only You would appoint a time for me</b><p>Job next asks God to set a definite date for his release&#8212;a divine appointment.<p>&#8226; Earlier he noted, &#8220;Man&#8217;s days are determined; You have decreed the number of his months&#8221; (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;2</a> affirms &#8220;There is a time for everything&#8230; a time to be born and a time to die.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> agrees: &#8220;It is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment.&#8221;<p>Job&#8217;s plea is for God to mark the calendar, assuring him that his suffering and even his stay in Sheol are on a leash held by the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and then remember me!</b><p>Finally, Job longs for God&#8217;s active remembrance&#8212;the kind that brings deliverance.<p>&#8226; &#8220;God remembered Noah&#8230; and He sent a wind over the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The dying thief begged, &#8220;Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom&#8221; and received paradise that very day (<a href="/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42&#8211;43</a>).<p>&#8226; Job himself will later declare, &#8220;I know that my Redeemer lives&#8230; yet in my flesh I will see God&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25&#8211;27</a>).<p>Thus, Job&#8217;s hope is resurrection: God will call his name, lift him from the grave, and restore fellowship. Remembering, in Scripture, always leads to saving action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a> is a four&#8211;part plea showing remarkable faith amid agony. He asks God to:<p>1. Hide him in the grave, affirming God&#8217;s rule over death.<p>2. Shelter him until righteous anger runs its course, trusting mercy will follow.<p>3. Fix an appointed time, resting in God&#8217;s precise sovereignty over all events.<p>4. Remember him afterward, anticipating resurrection and restored relationship.<p>Rather than despair, these words unveil a believer&#8217;s deep confidence that the Lord&#8217;s wrath is temporary, His timing perfect, and His final remembrance life&#8211;giving.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave!</span> literally, in <span class="accented">Sheol</span> which here does not so much mean "the grave," as the place of departed spirits, described in <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>.
