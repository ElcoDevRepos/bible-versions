In the context of the Book of Job, Leviathan symbolizes chaos and the untamable forces of nature, which only God can control. The rhetorical question emphasizes human limitations in the face of such a formidable creature, underscoring the theme of God's sovereignty over creation. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to Leviathan, such as in <a href="/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where it is depicted as a powerful sea monster subdued by God.<p><b>ringed by his fearsome teeth</b><br>The description of Leviathan's teeth as "fearsome" conveys a sense of terror and invincibility. In ancient Near Eastern mythology, sea monsters like Leviathan were often associated with chaos and destruction. The detailed description of its teeth serves to illustrate the creature's deadly nature and the futility of human attempts to conquer it. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for the overwhelming challenges and trials that humans face, which are beyond their control but within God's dominion. The fearsome nature of Leviathan's teeth also draws a parallel to the power of sin and evil, which can only be overcome through divine intervention, pointing to the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>- A righteous man tested by God through severe trials, including the loss of his wealth, health, and family.

Who would dare to do so? His teeth are terrible round about. The crocodile has "two rows of sharply pointed teeth, thirty or more on each side" (Russell's 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 460). They are "so formed and disposed as to tear their prey rather than masticate it" ('Dict. Universelle des Sciences,' p. 447). The voracity of the full-grown crocodile is great; and he will not scruple to attack and devour men, if they come in his way. The natives of Upper Egypt have a wholesome terror of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/41-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can open</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;it&#183;t&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6605.htm">Strong's 6605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open wide, to loosen, begin, plough, carve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his jaws,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(dal&#183;&#7791;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1817.htm">Strong's 1817: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something swinging, the valve of a, door</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ringed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5439.htm">Strong's 5439: </a> </span><span class="str2">A circle, neighbour, environs, around</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by his fearsome</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_367.htm">Strong's 367: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fright, an idol</span><br /><br /><span class="word">teeth?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;in&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8127.htm">Strong's 8127: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tooth,   ivory, a cliff</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/41-14.htm">Job 41:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/41-14.htm">OT Poetry: Job 41:14 Who can open the doors of his (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/41-13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 41:13"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 41:13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/41-15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 41:15"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 41:15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
