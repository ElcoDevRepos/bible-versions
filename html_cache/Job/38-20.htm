The "border" here refers to the boundaries of light and darkness, a concept that underscores God's control over creation. In biblical context, boundaries are often set by God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a> where God separates light from darkness. This separation is not just physical but also symbolic of order and divine authority. The rhetorical question implies that only God can control such cosmic elements, emphasizing His sovereignty. The idea of borders also connects to the Promised Land's boundaries given to Israel, symbolizing divine provision and protection.<p><b>Do you know the paths to its home?</b><br>This phrase continues the theme of divine wisdom versus human understanding. The "paths" suggest a journey or a course that light takes, which humans cannot fully comprehend or control. In ancient Near Eastern culture, paths often symbolized life's journey or destiny, which is ultimately directed by God. The "home" of light can be seen as its origin or resting place, a concept that aligns with God's role as the Creator who knows the beginning and end of all things. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>, where wisdom is personified and present at creation, further illustrating that true understanding and knowledge belong to God alone. The imagery of paths and homes can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, guiding believers on the path to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty Creator who responds to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of the universe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/whirlwind.htm">Whirlwind</a></b><br>The medium through which God speaks to Job, symbolizing His power and majesty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The broader context of God's discourse, emphasizing His sovereignty and wisdom in the natural world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paths_and_territory.htm">Paths and Territory</a></b><br>Metaphorical references to the order and boundaries set by God in creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_wisdom.htm">God's Sovereignty and Wisdom</a></b><br>Recognize that God's understanding and control over creation far exceed human comprehension.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_limitations.htm">Human Limitations</a></b><br>Acknowledge our limited perspective and knowledge compared to God's infinite wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_order.htm">Trust in God's Order</a></b><br>Trust that God has established order and boundaries in the universe, even when we do not understand them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Approach God with humility, recognizing our place in His creation and His ultimate authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_wisdom.htm">Seeking God's Wisdom</a></b><br>Pursue a deeper understanding of God's wisdom through prayer and study of His Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_38_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 38:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_38_20_s_impact_on_God_s_control.htm">How does Job 38:20 challenge our understanding of God's sovereignty over creation?
