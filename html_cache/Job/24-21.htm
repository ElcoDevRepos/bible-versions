In ancient Near Eastern culture, being barren or childless was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor or personal failure, leaving women in such situations particularly vulnerable to mistreatment. The lack of children meant a lack of protection and support, making them easy targets for exploitation. This reflects a broader biblical theme of God's concern for the marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, where God is described as a "father to the fatherless" and a "defender of widows." The predatory behavior condemned here is a direct violation of the biblical mandate to care for the weak and defenseless.<p><b>and show no kindness to the widow</b><br>Widows in biblical times were often left without financial support or social standing, making them another group vulnerable to exploitation. The Mosaic Law included specific provisions to protect widows, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17-21</a>, which commands the Israelites not to pervert justice for the widow and to leave gleanings in the field for them. The lack of kindness shown to widows in this verse is a direct affront to these divine commands. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> defines pure religion as looking after orphans and widows in their distress. The failure to show kindness to widows is indicative of a broader moral and spiritual failure, contrasting with the character of Jesus Christ, who showed compassion to widows, as seen in <a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-15</a>, where He raises the widow's son at Nain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man of great faith who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
