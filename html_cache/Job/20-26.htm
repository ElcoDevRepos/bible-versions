In biblical context, "darkness" often symbolizes judgment or the absence of God's presence (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>, <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>). The treasures, which may have been gained through unjust means, are ultimately futile and will not provide security or salvation (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). This reflects the broader theme in Job of the temporary nature of earthly wealth and the ultimate justice of God.<p><b>A fire unfanned will consume him</b><br>The imagery of "a fire unfanned" indicates a supernatural or divine fire, one that does not require human effort to ignite or sustain. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment, which is inevitable and all-consuming (<a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>). The idea of fire as a tool of divine retribution is common in scripture, such as in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and the purifying fire described in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. This fire represents the inescapable nature of divine justice.<p><b>and devour what is left in his tent.</b><br>The "tent" symbolizes the dwelling place or the household of the wicked, encompassing all that he possesses and holds dear. The destruction of what remains in his tent signifies the totality of the judgment, leaving nothing untouched. This reflects the biblical principle that the consequences of sin affect not only the individual but also their household (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>). The imagery of devouring suggests complete consumption, leaving no remnant, similar to the fate of those who oppose God as seen in the fate of Korah's rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Here it is not a passing cloud but a fixed destiny, underscoring that when God judges the unrepentant, He does so completely and irrevocably.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is reserved</b><p>The phrase &#8220;is reserved&#8221; reminds us that God sovereignly stores up just recompense for the wicked (<a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4, 17</a>). Judgment is not random; it is appointed. While mercy is abundant for those who turn to the Lord, unrepentant sin accumulates a debt that will one day be paid in full.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for his treasures</b><p>The objects of the wicked man&#8217;s pride&#8212;his &#8220;treasures&#8221;&#8212;become the very target of divine judgment.

Unlike earthly flames that die without fuel, this fire is self-sustained, signaling judgment that cannot be evaded or extinguished by human effort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will consume him</b><p>The judgment is personal: it &#8220;will consume him.&#8221; Divine retribution is not merely against possessions but against the person who persists in evil (<a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-9</a>).
