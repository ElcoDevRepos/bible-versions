In the context of the Book of Job, it reflects the belief that God can save and redeem individuals regardless of their guilt. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's willingness to forgive and restore sinners, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites sinners to reason with Him and promises cleansing. The idea of deliverance for the guilty also foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers redemption to all, regardless of their past sins (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><b>rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that the righteousness or purity of one person can have a redemptive effect on another. In the cultural and historical context of the Old Testament, the concept of intercession is significant. Figures like Abraham and Moses interceded for others, and their righteousness played a role in God's dealings with people (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). The phrase also points to the importance of personal integrity and righteousness, which can influence God's actions. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a precursor to the intercessory role of Christ, whose righteousness and sacrifice provide a means of rescue and salvation for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

While Eliphaz misjudged Job, his statement still unveils a gospel pattern: the righteous intercede, God listens, and the undeserving find rescue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">He shall deliver the island of the innocent </span>is undoubtedly an error for <span class= "ital">He shall deliver him that is not innocent: </span>that is, either God shall deliver, or the humble person, if that is the subject of the former clause; the humble-minded man would have saved them. "He would have delivered him that is not innocent; yea, even so shall he be delivered by the cleanness of thy hands," as the ten righteous would have saved Sodom. It is remarkable that this, which is the last word of Eliphaz, has in it the significance of a prophecy, for it is exactly thus that the history of Job closes; and Eliphaz himself exemplified his own promise in being indebted to Job for the act of intercession by which he was pardoned, together with his friends; <a href="/context/job/42-8.htm" title="Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.">Job 42:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall deliver the island of the innocent</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">shall deliver even him that is not innocent</span> (see the Revised Version).

Eliphaz thus prophesies his own deliverance and that of his two friends from God's wrath at the intercession of Job, as actually came to pass afterwards (see <a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-9</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/22-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will deliver [even]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1469;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1496;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;mal&#183;l&#234;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4422.htm">Strong's 4422: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be smooth, to escape, to release, rescue, to bring forth young, emit sparks</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the guilty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_336.htm">Strong's 336: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;q&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5355.htm">Strong's 5355: </a> </span><span class="str2">Clean, free from, exempt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who will be rescued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nim&#183;la&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4422.htm">Strong's 4422: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be smooth, to escape, to release, rescue, to bring forth young, emit sparks</span><br /><br /><span class="word">through the purity</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1252.htm">Strong's 1252: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cleanness, pureness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your hands.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(kap&#183;pe&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3709.htm">Strong's 3709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hollow or flat of the hand, palm, sole (of the foot), a pan</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/22-30.htm">OT Poetry: Job 22:30 He will even deliver him who (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/22-29.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 22:29"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 22:29" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/23-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 23:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 23:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
