This sentiment reflects the cultural and social dynamics of ancient Near Eastern societies, where honor and shame played significant roles. Being abhorred by others would have been a severe social stigma, indicating a complete loss of respect and status. This mirrors the experience of Jesus Christ, who was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>and keep far from me;</b><br>Job's isolation is emphasized here, highlighting the physical and emotional distance others maintain from him. In the historical context, leprosy and other diseases often led to social ostracism, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>, where those afflicted were required to live outside the camp. This separation underscores Job's suffering and parallels the isolation Jesus experienced during His crucifixion, when even His disciples deserted Him (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>).<p><b>they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</b><br>Spitting in someone's face was a profound act of contempt and humiliation in ancient cultures, symbolizing utter disrespect. This act is reminiscent of the treatment Jesus received during His trial, where He was spat upon and mocked (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>). The connection to Christ's suffering serves as a typological foreshadowing of the ultimate righteous sufferer, who bore scorn and shame for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
