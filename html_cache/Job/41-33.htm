In the context of Job, Leviathan represents a powerful and untamable force of nature, symbolizing chaos and the limits of human control. The description of Leviathan in <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a> aligns with ancient Near Eastern mythology, where similar sea creatures are depicted as formidable adversaries. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty over all creation, as even the most fearsome creatures are under His dominion. The uniqueness of Leviathan can be seen as a reflection of God's unmatched power and wisdom, as highlighted in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where Leviathan is also mentioned.<p><b>a creature devoid of fear!</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the fearless nature of Leviathan, suggesting that it is unchallenged and unafraid of any other being. In the cultural context of the ancient world, fearlessness was often associated with divine or semi-divine beings, reinforcing the idea that Leviathan is beyond human control. This characteristic can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and sufferings that Job faces, which are overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of God's ultimate authority and the idea that true fearlessness comes from trust in Him, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.

The phrase underscores that, within the visible creation, this beast stands unrivaled (<a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture echoes the idea of unique sea creatures displaying God&#8217;s power: &#8220;There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a>). <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> records God creating &#8220;the great sea creatures,&#8221; reminding us that every formidable being still falls under His creative hand.<p>&#8226; The point: when we survey everything &#8220;on earth,&#8221; not one thing matches Leviathan&#8217;s might&#8212;yet Leviathan is merely part of God&#8217;s world, directing our gaze upward to the Creator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is his equal</b><p>&#8226; The Lord stresses that no rival exists for Leviathan among earthly beings. &#8220;Who then can stand against Me?&#8221; follows immediately (<a href="/job/41-10.htm">Job 41:10</a>), weaving together creature and Creator: if the monster has no equal, how much more the Maker.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8-10</a> praises God for crushing Rahab, a poetic sea monster, showing that the Almighty alone can master what humankind cannot.<p>&#8226; Like the fearless lion that &#8220;turns aside for nothing&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>), Leviathan dominates its realm. The lesson: human limits highlight God&#8217;s limitless strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a creature</b><p>&#8226; By calling Leviathan a &#8220;creature,&#8221; God reminds Job that even the most terrifying being remains created, not divine (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This guards us from mythologizing the beast. Whether we picture a crocodile, a massive marine reptile, or an extinct monster, it still belongs in the catalog of &#8220;all things great and small&#8221; fashioned by God (<a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The Creator&#8211;creature distinction is foundational: we worship the Lord, not His works (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>devoid of fear!</b><p>&#8226; Leviathan&#8217;s confidence is legendary: &#8220;When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw in despair&#8221; (<a href="/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>). Nothing makes the creature flinch.<p>&#8226; His impenetrable armor (<a href="/job/41-15.htm">Job 41:15-17</a>) and untamable spirit illustrate a life untouched by human threats. <a href="/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a> speaks similarly of the lion.<p>&#8226; Yet God asks, &#8220;Can you draw Leviathan with a hook?&#8221; (<a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>), showing that while the beast fears nothing below, it remains subject to the One above. Fearlessness in creation spotlights the absolute sovereignty of the Lord who instilled that boldness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/41-33.htm">Job 41:33</a> crowns the Lord&#8217;s vivid description of Leviathan: unmatched on earth, unequaled in power, utterly fearless&#8212;yet still a mere creature. The verse magnifies God by contrast: if humanity trembles before Leviathan, how much more should we revere the God who formed and governs it. Recognizing this, Job humbly responds, &#8220;I know that You can do all things&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>). The passage calls us to the same awe-filled trust, resting in the Almighty whose works, from the smallest sparrow to the fearsome Leviathan, testify to His unrivaled majesty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33, 34) <span class= "bld">Upon earth there is not his like.</span>--Some have proposed to take away the last two verses of Job 41 from their connection with the crocodile, and to transpose them, referring them to man, so as to come before <a href="/job/41-8.htm" title="Lay your hand on him, remember the battle, do no more.">Job 41:8</a>, understanding them thus: "There is one whose like is not upon earth, who is made without dread. He seeth every high thing, and is king over all the proud beasts. To Him then I say (<a href="/job/41-8.htm" title="Lay your hand on him, remember the battle, do no more.">Job 41:8</a>), Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more. Lo! his hope is deceived. Is he indeed cast down at the very eight of him? He is not so cruel to himself that he should rouse him up. Who then can stand before me? Who hath first given to me, that I should have to repay him? That which is under the whole heavens is mine." It cannot be denied that this makes very good sense, but it seems to be too great a liberty to take with the text as we find it to adopt this as the true order of the verses; for in that case, what is there that we might not deal with in a like manner? Those who advocate this transposition in the order of the verses would also place <a href="/context/job/40-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,">Job 40:1-5</a> so as to follow <a href="/job/40-6.htm" title="Then answered the LORD to Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 40:6</a>, in this manner: "Then Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou canst do everything, and that no purpose can be withholden from thee, or that no purpose of thine can be restrained." Then the next words come in as the implied answer of God: "Who is this that hideth my counsel for want of knowledge?" To which Job replies: "Therefore (I confess that) I have uttered without understanding things too wonderful for me, which I knew not." Again God replies, as in <a href="/job/38-3.htm" title="Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="/job/40-7.htm" title="Gird up your loins now like a man: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 40:7</a> : "Hear, I beseech thee and I will speak, I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me; to which Job answers: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor what I have said, and repent it in dust and ashes." Then the Lord answered Job and said, "Is he that contended with the Almighty reproved? Does he acknowledge his discomfiture? He that argueth with God, let him answer this question." Then Job answered the Lord and said, "Behold I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand before my mouth; once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will not do so again." There is a certain amount of sharpness and point obtained in thus making this confession the climax of the poem, and a kind of formal consistency is secured in regarding this resolution as Job's last utterance instead of making him speak again, as he does, according to the present order, in <a href="/job/42-2.htm" title="I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.">Job 42:2</a>. But this consistency is formal rather than real, inasmuch as there is no inconsistency in the <span class= "ital">tone </span>of <a href="/job/42-2.htm" title="I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.">Job 42:2</a> <span class= "ital">seqq., </span>and the promise of <a href="/job/40-5.htm" title="Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.">Job 40:5</a>. Whatever advantage may be derived from the re-arrangement will be a matter for individual taste rather to decide, which will vary with the individual; and at all events, the climax of <a href="/job/42-6.htm" title="Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.">Job 42:6</a> as it stands is a very noble one, and we may question whether we can heighten its grandeur. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear</span> (comp. vers. 24-29). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/41-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nothing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6083.htm">Strong's 6083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dust, clay, earth, mud</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is his equal&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
