In the context of Job's lament, it underscores the despair and hopelessness he feels. Biblically, this aligns with the understanding that after death, a person does not return to their earthly dwelling (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5-6</a>). Theologically, it points to the separation between the living and the dead, a theme also seen in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), where the rich man cannot return to warn his family. Culturally, ancient Near Eastern beliefs often included the idea of an afterlife, but Job's statement here reflects a more somber view of death's finality.<p><b>his place remembers him no more.</b><br>This phrase suggests the transient nature of human life and the inevitability of being forgotten. In the ancient world, one's "place" could refer to their home, community, or even their role in society. The idea that a place no longer remembers someone highlights the fleeting nature of human legacy and the limited impact one has after death. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compares human life to grass that flourishes and then is gone, leaving no trace. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the importance of eternal values over temporal achievements. In a typological sense, it contrasts with the eternal remembrance and legacy of Jesus Christ, whose life and sacrifice have everlasting significance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

We need not force these words too much, as though they forbad our ascribing to Job any belief in a future life or in the resurrection, because, under any circumstances, they are evidently and accurately true of man as we know him here. Even though he may live again in another way, it is not in this world that he lives again, and it is of this world and of man in this world that Job is speaking. And man, in the aspect of his mortality, is truly a pitiable object, demanding our compassion and sympathy. Happily, the appeal to man's Maker is not in vain, and He who has made him what he is has looked upon his misery. Consequently Job can say, therefore, "I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall return no more to his house</span>.
