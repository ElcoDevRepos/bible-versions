This reflects the depth of his suffering and despair. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, birth was typically a time of joy and celebration, yet Job wishes for the opposite. This sentiment echoes the curse motif found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>, where Jeremiah also curses the day of his birth. Job's lamentation is a profound expression of human suffering and the desire to escape it, which is a theme that resonates throughout the book.<p><b>and the night it was said,</b><br>The mention of "the night" highlights the specific moment of conception, which was often celebrated in ancient cultures as the beginning of life. In biblical terms, night can symbolize darkness and obscurity, contrasting with the light of day. Job's wish for this night to be forgotten underscores his desire for his existence to be nullified. This reflects the broader biblical theme of light versus darkness, where darkness often represents suffering, ignorance, or evil.<p><b>&#8216;A boy is conceived.&#8217;</b><br>The announcement of a male child was particularly significant in the patriarchal society of the Old Testament, where sons were often seen as a blessing and a continuation of the family line. Job's lament here is not just a personal wish for non-existence but also a rejection of the societal and familial expectations tied to his birth. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of the value of life and the importance of lineage, as seen in the genealogies and promises throughout Scripture, such as the promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>. In a typological sense, Job's suffering and desire for his birth to be undone can be seen as a precursor to the suffering servant motif, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who also experienced profound suffering and rejection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Earlier Scripture says, &#8220;In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>). His lament continues that integrity&#8212;anguish without blasphemy.<p>&#8226; By calling for the &#8220;day&#8221; to &#8220;perish,&#8221; Job wishes the calendar itself could be erased&#8212;an echo of Jeremiah&#8217;s later outcry, &#8220;Cursed be the day I was born!&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Such cries appear elsewhere&#8212;Elijah under the broom tree (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>) and Jonah outside Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/4-3.htm">Jonah 4:3</a>). Scripture never applauds these wishes, yet it faithfully records them, showing God&#8217;s Word is honest about the darkest human emotions.<p>&#8226; The lament underscores life&#8217;s sanctity even in despair: Job longs for non-existence, but he does not take his own life (<a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9-10</a>). The sanctity of life remains intact while suffering is candidly confessed.<p>&#8226; This verse prepares the way for the later revelation that only God can redeem bitter days, as seen when Joseph says, &#8220;You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the night it was said, &#8220;A boy is conceived.&#8221;</b><p>Job widens the curse from the &#8220;day&#8221; of his birth to the &#8220;night&#8221; of his conception (<a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>b).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, conception is celebrated as God&#8217;s handiwork&#8212;&#8220;You knit me together in my mother&#8217;s womb&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>) and &#8220;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). Job&#8217;s wish therefore sounds shocking; that is the point&#8212;his pain feels utterly incompatible with the joy that normally greets new life.<p>&#8226; By targeting the announcement, &#8220;A boy is conceived,&#8221; Job laments not only his suffering but also the hopes his parents once held. The night of joyful proclamation now seems pointless.<p>&#8226; Yet even in this darkness, invisible mercy glimmers: God remembers every &#8220;night&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>), and the very Book that records Job&#8217;s complaint eventually records his restoration (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights the gospel pattern: sorrow to joy, death to life. Just as Job&#8217;s night appeared cursed, so did the night of Gethsemane, yet resurrection followed (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>; 28:6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a> captures a righteous man&#8217;s raw cry: if only the calendar could erase both the day he was born and the night he was conceived. His words are not a theological denial of life&#8217;s value but an honest portrayal of suffering&#8217;s weight. Scripture answers such cries not with condemnation, but with the unfolding story of a Redeemer who turns cursed days into blessed ones and transforms nights of despair into mornings of joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;May the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1453;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of my birth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;iw&#183;w&#257;&#183;le&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">perish,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6.htm">Strong's 6: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wander away, lose oneself, to perish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the night</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hal&#183;lay&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
