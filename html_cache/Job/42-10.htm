This act of prayer demonstrates Job's forgiveness and obedience to God's command (<a href="/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>). It reflects the biblical principle of interceding for others, as seen in Abraham's prayer for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>) and Moses' intercession for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). Job's willingness to pray for those who wronged him aligns with Jesus' teaching to love and pray for one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>the LORD restored his prosperity</b><br>The restoration of Job's fortunes signifies God's approval and blessing. This restoration is not merely material but also spiritual, as Job's relationship with God is renewed. The concept of restoration is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the return of the Israelites from exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>) and the promise of spiritual renewal through Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). It underscores God's sovereignty and grace in restoring what was lost.<p><b>and doubled his former possessions</b><br>The doubling of Job's possessions is a tangible expression of God's abundant blessing. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor. This doubling echoes the principle of receiving more than what was lost, as seen in the law of restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4, 7</a>). It also prefigures the abundant life promised in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>), highlighting God's ability to bless beyond human expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and loss but remained faithful to God.

Instead of harboring resentment, he blesses them, living out what Jesus later teaches: &#8220;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p>&#8211; Job&#8217;s willingness to forgive displays genuine repentance and humility (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6-10</a>).<p>&#8211; His prayer signals restored fellowship with God; like Abraham praying for Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-17.htm">Genesis 20:17</a>), the intercession of a righteous man avails much (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p>&#8211; The order matters: the blessing follows obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD restored his prosperity</b><p>Immediately after Job&#8217;s act of grace, &#8220;the LORD restored his prosperity.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly portrays God as the Restorer of fortunes (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Restoration comes from the LORD, not from chance or Job&#8217;s own effort (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8211; God vindicates Job publicly, reversing the suffering Satan had inflicted (<a href="/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Restoration is holistic: spiritual peace (<a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>a), renewed relationships (<a href="/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>), and material blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and doubled his former possessions</b><p>God doesn&#8217;t merely replace what was lost; He multiplies it. &#8220;Instead of shame you will receive a double portion&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Doubling underscores divine generosity (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) and justice (<a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>).<p>&#8211; It fulfills the pattern of double recompense found throughout Scripture (<a href="/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The detail proves God&#8217;s sovereignty: the same Lord who allowed the losses now commands abundance, affirming <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a> shows that humble obedience and forgiving intercession open the door for God&#8217;s lavish restoration. After Job prays for his friends, the Lord not only heals his life but doubles his wealth, demonstrating that God rewards faithfulness far beyond what was forfeited.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">When he prayed for his friends.</span>--Job's personal discipline was not complete till he passed from the sphere of his own sorrows to the work of intercession for his friends, and it was through the very act of this self-oblivion and self-sacrifice that his own deliverance was brought about. When he prayed for his friends, we are told, the Lord turned his own captivity: that is, restored and re-instated him in prosperity even greater than before.<p>This is the true moral of all human history, which is to be accomplished in the world of the regeneration, if not here. All sorrow is fraught with the promise and the hope of future blessedness, and to know that is to rob sorrow of its pain. It is impossible to reap the full gain of it when the burden presses, but, as far as it can be done, sorrow is mitigated. Had Job been able to look forward with confidence to his actual deliverance, he would have been able to bear his affliction; it was because he could not that all was dark. And after all there are sorrows and afflictions for which there is no deliverance like Job's; there is a captivity which can never be turned in this life, and for this the only hope is the sure hope of the Gospel, and the promise which in its degree is afforded by the history of Job: for if Job's is a representative history, as we are bound to believe it must be, then the lesson of it must be that what is not explained or mended here will be explained and mended hereafter. It is God alone who can enlighten the darkness which surrounds His counsels; but at the same time we must remember that with Him is the well of life, and in His light we shall see light.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord turned the captivity of Job</span>. The literal use of this phrase is common, the metaphorical use of it uncommon, in Scripture. Still, it is so simple a metaphor, and captivity so common a thing among ancient peoples, that it may well have been in general use among the nations of Western Asia from very primitive times. It signifies, as Professor Lee remarks, "a restoration to former happy circumstances." When he prayed for his friends. Perhaps his complete forgiveness by God was contingent on his own complete forgiveness of his "friends" (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12, 14, 15</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-32.htm">Matthew 18:32-35</a>); at any rate, his restoration immediately followed his intercession.
