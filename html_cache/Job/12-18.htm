In the ancient Near East, kings were seen as the ultimate authority, often believed to be divinely appointed. However, this statement emphasizes that God has the power to override human authority. The imagery of "loosening bonds" suggests liberation and the breaking of constraints, which can be seen in biblical narratives such as the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-32</a>) and the release of Peter from prison (<a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6-11</a>). It underscores the theme that God can free individuals and nations from oppression, regardless of the power of earthly rulers.<p><b>and fastens a belt around their waists.</b><br>The act of fastening a belt signifies preparation and readiness, often associated with girding oneself for action or service. In biblical times, a belt was used to secure garments, allowing for freedom of movement and indicating a state of preparedness. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for God equipping and empowering individuals for specific tasks or roles. It may also imply a shift in authority or responsibility, as seen in the anointing of new leaders or the rise of unexpected figures in biblical history, such as David's anointing as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The belt can symbolize strength and support, reflecting how God provides what is necessary for His purposes to be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>Represents earthly rulers and authorities who wield power and influence over nations and people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate sovereign who has control over all creation, including the rise and fall of earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_earthly_powers.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Earthly Powers</a></b><br>God has the ultimate authority over all rulers and kingdoms.

This may either mean that God at his pleasure both looses kings from captivity, and also binds them with a cord and causes them to be carried away captive; or that he looses the authority which kings have over their subjects, and then lets them be carried away captive by their enemies.
