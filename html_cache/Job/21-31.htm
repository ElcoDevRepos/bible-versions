Here, Job questions the apparent lack of accountability for the wicked. In ancient Near Eastern culture, confronting someone directly about their wrongdoing was a bold and often dangerous act, especially if the person was powerful or wealthy. This phrase highlights the societal reluctance to challenge those in authority or with influence, reflecting a broader theme in the Bible about the difficulty of confronting sin and injustice. This can be connected to the prophetic tradition, where prophets like Nathan (2 Samuel 12) and Elijah (1 Kings 18) boldly confronted kings about their sins, serving as types of Christ who also confronted the religious leaders of His day (Matthew 23).<p><b>Who repays him for what he has done?</b><br>This phrase questions the justice system of the world, where the wicked often seem to escape punishment. In the biblical narrative, the concept of divine retribution is central, yet Job observes that the wicked frequently prosper without immediate consequences. This reflects the tension between the present reality and the ultimate justice of God, a theme echoed in Psalms and Proverbs (Psalm 73, <a href="/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19-20</a>). Theologically, this points to the eschatological hope of final judgment, where God will repay each person according to their deeds (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). This also prefigures the role of Christ as the ultimate judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), who will bring about perfect justice in the end times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who visit Job to offer counsel but often accuse him of wrongdoing as the cause of his suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In this context, Job refers to those who prosper despite their immoral actions, questioning why they are not held accountable.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and arbiter of justice, whose ways and reasons are often beyond human understanding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>The land of Uz, where Job resides, serving as the backdrop for the dialogues and discourses on suffering and divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_divine_justice.htm">The Mystery of Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is not always immediately apparent.

Job&#8217;s frustration is real, but ultimate justice is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Job asks two piercing questions to expose the gap between human justice and divine justice. On earth, few dare challenge the powerful wrong-doer, and no court invariably holds him accountable. Yet Scripture assures us the silence of people does not equal the silence of God. Though confrontation and repayment may be postponed, they are never canceled; the Lord Himself will address every deed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who shall declare his way to his face?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Who shall denounce?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Who will be bold enough to tell the rich and powerful man that he is wicked? that his "way," or course of life, is altogether wrong? <span class="cmt_word">And who shall repay him what he hath done?</span> Still less will any one be found who will take upon him to attack such a one, to prosecute him in courts or otherwise bring him to condign punishment.
