The scorn from "little boys" highlights the depth of Job's humiliation and the complete reversal of social norms. This phrase underscores the totality of Job's alienation and the loss of his former status and respect. In biblical context, children were expected to honor their elders, as seen in the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The scorn from children indicates a societal breakdown in respect and further emphasizes Job's isolation and suffering.<p><b>when I appear,</b><br>The phrase "when I appear" suggests that Job's presence alone is enough to provoke derision. This indicates that his suffering and the visible signs of his affliction have become a spectacle. In the cultural context of the time, physical appearance was often associated with one's spiritual and moral state. Job's appearance, marred by disease and suffering, would have been interpreted by others as a sign of divine disfavor or punishment. This reflects the broader theme in the Book of Job of misunderstanding and misjudgment by those around him.<p><b>they deride me.</b><br>Derision from children, who are typically seen as innocent and unassuming, highlights the extent of Job's degradation. This public mockery is a profound social disgrace, as ridicule from the least significant members of society signifies a complete loss of dignity. In the broader biblical narrative, derision and mockery are often associated with the suffering of the righteous. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also mocked and scorned during His passion (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>). Job's experience foreshadows the suffering servant motif, where the righteous endure scorn and derision as part of their trial and ultimate vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
