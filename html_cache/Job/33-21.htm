In the context of Job, it reflects the severe suffering and affliction that Job is experiencing. The wasting away of flesh can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and emotional anguish that accompanies physical suffering. Biblically, this imagery is reminiscent of other instances of suffering and disease, such as leprosy, which was a common affliction in biblical times and often led to social isolation. Theologically, this wasting away can be seen as a consequence of sin and the fallen state of humanity, echoing the curse of decay and death introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. It also foreshadows the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bears the iniquities of others and is "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>and his hidden bones protrude</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the severity of the physical condition, where even the bones, typically hidden beneath flesh, become visible. This can symbolize the exposure of one's innermost being and vulnerabilities during times of extreme distress. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such a condition would be seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment, as health and prosperity were often associated with divine favor. The protruding bones can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His crucifixion, was marred beyond human likeness (<a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>) and whose bones were not broken (<a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>), fulfilling prophecy.

The body that once looked strong now &#8220;wastes away&#8221; until it is painful to watch (<a href="/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>a).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links visible physical decline with deep spiritual need. David cries, &#8220;My strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>). The psalmist also confesses, &#8220;My flesh and my heart fail&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>), reminding us that God sometimes allows weakness to expose our dependence on Him.<p>&#8226; This wasting is not merely the normal course of aging; Elihu pictures severe affliction&#8212;like Job&#8217;s boils (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>) or the wasting sickness mentioned in <a href="/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3-5</a>&#8212;that strips away health, vanity, and self-reliance.<p>&#8226; Key takeaway: physical frailty can serve as God&#8217;s mercy signal, urging repentance and renewed trust (<a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11-12</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his hidden bones protrude</b><p>&#8226; Bones normally &#8220;hidden&#8221; beneath muscle and flesh now jut out, a graphic sign of extreme emaciation (<a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a> offers Job&#8217;s own testimony: &#8220;I am nothing but skin and bones&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This image conveys helplessness, echoing <a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet Elihu&#8217;s goal is not mere pity; he is highlighting how God sometimes brings a person to the edge of death &#8220;to turn his soul back from the Pit&#8221; (<a href="/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a>). The protruding bones are a wake-up call, much like Paul&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God can use even wasting sickness to strip away every earthly prop, so that the sufferer hears His redemptive voice (<a href="/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67, 71</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a> paints a stark portrait of a man brought to the brink of death: first his flesh visibly melts away, then even his concealed bones push through the skin. Elihu uses this vivid reality to show how God sometimes employs severe physical affliction to arrest a person&#8217;s attention, humble pride, and invite heartfelt repentance. The verse is therefore both literal&#8212;describing real, agonizing sickness&#8212;and instructive, reminding believers that when the body fails, God is often at work to rescue the soul and restore true life in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from the sight</span>; but the Authorized Version gives probably the correct meaning. And his bones that were not seen stick out. These are general features of a wasting illness (comp. <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, "I may tell all my bones"). Such illness gives the sufferer time to review thoroughly his life and cow duct, and see to it "if there be any way of wickedness in him," or any particular form of sin to which he is tempted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/33-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His flesh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1320.htm">Strong's 1320: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flesh, body, person, the pudenda of a, man</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wastes away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1443;&#1499;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#183;&#7733;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3615.htm">Strong's 3615: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be complete, at an end, finished, accomplished, or spent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from sight,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7210.htm">Strong's 7210: </a> </span><span class="str2">Looking, seeing, sight</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his hidden</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bones</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1437;&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7779;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6106.htm">Strong's 6106: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bone, the body, the substance, selfsame</span><br /><br /><span class="word">protrude.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1508;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;up&#183;p&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Conjunctive perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8205.htm">Strong's 8205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bareness, a smooth or bare height</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/33-21.htm">OT Poetry: Job 33:21 His flesh is so consumed away that (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/33-20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 33:20"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 33:20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/33-22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 33:22"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 33:22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
