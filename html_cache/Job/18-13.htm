In the context of Job, it reflects the intense physical and emotional torment Job is experiencing. The imagery of skin being devoured can be linked to the boils and sores that Job suffers from, as described earlier in the book (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>). This suffering is emblematic of the broader theme of human frailty and the consequences of living in a fallen world. The idea of something devouring the skin also echoes the curses of disobedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>, where skin diseases are mentioned as a form of divine judgment.<p><b>the firstborn of death devours his limbs.</b><br>The "firstborn of death" is a metaphorical expression that personifies death as having a firstborn, suggesting a powerful and primary agent of destruction. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the firstborn often held a place of prominence and strength, so this phrase emphasizes the severity and inevitability of death's power. The devouring of limbs indicates a complete and overwhelming destruction, not just a superficial affliction. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory of death over the body, which is later countered by the hope of resurrection and eternal life in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the belief in the sovereignty of God over life and death, and the hope for redemption through Christ, who conquers death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up arguing with him.

Compare the consuming curses on disobedience in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>, where the LORD warns of an &#8220;incurable plague on your knees and legs.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-8</a> echoes the same thought: &#8220;There is no soundness in my flesh&#8230; my wounds fester and ooze because of my foolishness.&#8221; The physical breakdown dramatizes moral and spiritual ruin.<p>- By focusing on the skin&#8212;the body&#8217;s outermost, most visible layer&#8212;Bildad underlines that sin&#8217;s consequences cannot be hidden. Everything deteriorates in plain sight (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22-23</a>; <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the firstborn of death devours his limbs</b><p>- &#8220;The firstborn of death&#8221; personifies death as a father whose eldest is the deadliest. In Scripture, the firstborn bears special weight (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), so the phrase signals the most potent, premier agent of destruction.<p>- This is no random illness; it is death&#8217;s champion sent to finish what the surface sores began, moving from skin to &#8220;limbs,&#8221; the very structure that lets a man stand, work, and fight (<a href="/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>; <a href="/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a> uses &#8220;firstborn&#8221; similarly to describe the pick of devastation among the poor&#8212;again, the best (or worst) exemplar. Bildad&#8217;s point is that the wicked face not a glancing blow but death&#8217;s fullest force (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>).<p>- The progression from patches to limbs hints at total collapse: once the outer defenses fall, the inner support is consumed. It anticipates the ultimate, final judgment when &#8220;death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a> pictures a literal, escalating judgment: visible sores begin the process, and death&#8217;s most lethal agent finishes it by consuming the entire body. Bildad&#8217;s warning is stark&#8212;sin invites a relentless destruction that starts on the surface and moves to the core, leaving nothing untouched. Those who refuse God&#8217;s ways will ultimately face death&#8217;s &#8220;firstborn,&#8221; but in Christ we meet the Firstborn from the dead who overcomes that very fate (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The strength of his skin.</span>--This verse should probably be rendered, "It shall devour the members of his body, even the firstborn of death shall devour his members;" and by the "firstborn of death" is probably to be understood some wasting disease such as Job's, the phrase being so used as a euphemism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall devour the strength of his skin</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the bars of his skin</span> by which some understand "the muscles," some "the members," of his body.
