In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is speaking about the fate of the wicked, suggesting that they are constantly beset by fears. This imagery of being surrounded by terrors is reminiscent of the curses described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-66.htm">Deuteronomy 28:66-67</a>, where a disobedient Israel would live in constant dread. The idea of being encircled by fear also connects to <a href="/psalms/88-17.htm">Psalm 88:17</a>, where the psalmist describes being overwhelmed by troubles. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and emotional turmoil that can afflict those who are separated from God&#8217;s protection.<p><b>and harass his every step</b><br>The notion of harassment at every step suggests a relentless pursuit by these terrors, leaving no room for peace or respite. This can be compared to the imagery in <a href="/psalms/140-4.htm">Psalm 140:4</a>, where the psalmist asks for protection from those who would trip up his steps. In a broader biblical context, this relentless pursuit can be seen as a consequence of sin, as described in <a href="/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>, where calamity pursues sinners. Theologically, this can be interpreted as the natural outcome of living outside of God&#8217;s will, where one&#8217;s path is fraught with difficulties and dangers. This relentless harassment can also be seen as a type of the spiritual warfare that believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

It presses in &#8220;on every side&#8221; like the curses promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>, where God warns that disobedience brings &#8220;anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s friends believe Job must be this wicked man. While they are wrong about Job, the principle remains accurate&#8212;persistent sin invites unrelenting dread (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>: &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues&#8221;).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse is a sober reminder that security is found only in right relationship with God (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4, 7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and harass his every step</b><p>The second half of the verse piles on the imagery: &#8220;and harass his every step.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Every step&#8221; signals that anxiety dogs the wicked man&#8217;s daily routine. Compare <a href="/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21</a>: &#8220;Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bildad&#8217;s word &#8220;harass&#8221; paints fear as an active pursuer, like the &#8220;lion&#8221; imagery in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> describing Satan prowling &#8220;looking for someone to devour.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse illustrates God&#8217;s moral order: sin invites inner and outer turmoil that shadows one&#8217;s path (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>). It also anticipates the final judgment, when terror will culminate in eternal separation for those apart from Christ (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<p>&#8226; By contrast, those who trust the Lord walk differently: &#8220;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). God&#8217;s presence turns harassment into hope for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a> teaches that a life set against God is surrounded and stalked by relentless fear&#8212;&#8220;Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.&#8221; Bildad misapplies the principle to Job, yet the principle stands: sin invites terror, while faith in the Lord brings safety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Shall drive him to his feet.</span>--Comp. <a href="/job/15-21.htm" title="A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.">Job 15:21</a>.
