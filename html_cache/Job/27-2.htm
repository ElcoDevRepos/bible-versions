In the ancient Near Eastern context, invoking the life of a deity was a common way to assert truthfulness. Job's use of "God" here reflects his unwavering belief in God's existence and sovereignty, despite his suffering. This echoes similar affirmations found in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>, where oaths are made in the name of God to emphasize truth.<p><b>who has deprived me of justice</b><br>Job feels wronged and perceives that God has denied him justice. This reflects the central theme of the Book of Job: the struggle to understand suffering and divine justice. In the cultural context of the time, justice was often seen as a direct reflection of one's righteousness or sinfulness. Job's assertion challenges this notion, as he maintains his innocence. This theme is explored throughout the book, particularly in Job's dialogues with his friends, who argue that suffering is a result of sin (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7-8</a>).<p><b>the Almighty, who has embittered my soul</b><br>The term "Almighty" (Shaddai) emphasizes God's power and might. Job acknowledges God's omnipotence, even as he laments his own bitterness. This bitterness is a natural human response to profound suffering and loss, as seen in Job's earlier laments (<a href="/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20-26</a>). Theologically, this phrase highlights the tension between God's sovereignty and human suffering, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, including in the Psalms of lament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13</a>). Job's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also suffered unjustly and expressed deep anguish (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>), yet ultimately trusted in God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

In one sentence, Job shows us how to hold fast to God&#8217;s reality and sovereignty while honestly laying our wounded heart before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment.</span>--Job's faith leads him to see that, though there may be no explanation for his sufferings, yet they are laid upon him by God for purposes of His own, which are veiled from him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As</span> <span class="cmt_word">God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment</span>, Job has not previously introduced any form of adjuration. His "yea has been yea, and his nay nay." Now, however, under the solemn circumstances of the occasion, when he is making his last appeal to his friends for a favourable judgment, he thinks it not inappropriate to preface what he is about to say by an appeal to God as his Witness. "As God liveth," or "As the Lord liveth," was the customary oath of pious Israelites and of God-fearing men generally in the ancient world (see <a href="/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-13.htm">2 Chronicles 18:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>). Job adds that the God to whom he appeals is he who has "taken away," or "withheld," his judgment, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has declined to enter with him into a controversy as to the justice of his doings (<a href="/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; 13:31; 23:3-7). <span class="cmt_word">And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">made my soul bitter.</span> Though he slays him, yet does Job trust in God (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).
