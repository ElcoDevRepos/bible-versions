The context is Job's immense suffering and the failure of his friends to provide the empathy and understanding he needs. This reflects the broader theme of human inadequacy in providing true comfort without divine wisdom. The friends' lack of help can be seen as a failure to understand God's purposes, a recurring theme in the book. This phrase also highlights the limitations of human wisdom compared to divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where reliance on God rather than human understanding is emphasized.<p><b>you see terror,</b><br>The "terror" here refers to the overwhelming nature of Job's suffering and the divine judgment his friends perceive. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, suffering was often seen as a direct result of divine displeasure or judgment. Job's friends interpret his suffering as evidence of hidden sin, reflecting a common belief of the time that suffering was always a consequence of personal wrongdoing. This misinterpretation is a central issue in the dialogues between Job and his friends. The terror they see could also symbolize the fear of God's wrath, a theme explored in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the Psalms and the Prophets.<p><b>and you are afraid.</b><br>The fear of Job's friends can be understood as a fear of the same fate befalling them, or a fear of confronting the reality of innocent suffering. This fear prevents them from offering genuine support and leads them to cling to their rigid theological views. Their fear is indicative of a lack of faith and understanding of God's sovereignty and justice, themes that are explored throughout the book of Job. This fear contrasts with the biblical call to trust in God even amidst suffering, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, which encourages believers not to fear because God is with them. The friends' fear also highlights the human tendency to avoid confronting difficult truths about suffering and divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Here Job penetrates to the motive which had produced the conduct of his friends. They had come with good intentions, meaning to comfort and console him; but when they came, and saw what a wreck he was, how utterly "broken up" and ruined, they began to be afraid of showing too much friendliness. They thought him an object of the Divine vengeance, and feared lest, if they showed him sympathy, they might involve themselves in his punishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/6-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1453;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1457;&#1497;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#277;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of no help;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
