Job's friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, demonstrate empathy by physically lowering themselves to Job's level, sharing in his grief. This act reflects the cultural practice of mourning alongside those who suffer, as seen in other biblical accounts such as in <a href="/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, where elders sit on the ground in silence.<p><b>for seven days and seven nights,</b><br>The period of seven days and nights is significant in biblical terms, often representing completeness or perfection. This mirrors the mourning period for the dead, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>, where Joseph mourns his father Jacob for seven days. The duration underscores the depth of Job's suffering and the commitment of his friends to be present with him during this time.<p><b>but no one spoke a word to him</b><br>Silence in the face of suffering can be a profound form of support, acknowledging the depth of pain that words cannot address. This silence is reminiscent of the wisdom found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>, which states there is "a time to be silent and a time to speak." The friends' initial silence contrasts with their later speeches, which become critical and accusatory.<p><b>because they saw how intense his suffering was.</b><br>The friends' silence is motivated by the visible intensity of Job's suffering. This acknowledges the reality of Job's condition, which is described in detail in <a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7-8</a>, where he is afflicted with painful sores. The friends' initial response is appropriate, recognizing the gravity of Job's situation.

Professor Lee supposes that this is not to be taken literally. "It means" he says, "that they sat with him a considerable length of time before they opened the question discussed in this book, not that they sat precisely seven days and seven nights, and said not so much as one word to him" ('The Book of the Patriarch Job; p. 194). But the period of" seven days" was appropriate to mournings (<a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a> 2Samuel 31:13 <a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>), and if they could stay with him one day and one night without speaking, why not seven? Food would be brought them, and they might sleep rolled up in their <span class="accented">begeds</span>. The long silence may be accounted for by the fact that "among the Jews," and among Orientals generally, "it is a point of decorum, and one dictated by a fine and true feeling, not to speak to a person in deep affliction until he gives an intimation of a desire to be comforted" (Cook). So long as Job kept silence they had to keep silence, at least so far as he was concerned. They might speak to any attendants who drew near, and they might speak one to another. Note the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And none spake a word unto him</span> None spake <span class="accented">to him</span>; but no etiquette imposed complete silence on them. <span class="cmt_word">For they saw that his grief was very great</span>. So great that he could not as yet bear to be spoken to. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they sat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
