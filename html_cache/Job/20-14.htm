In biblical terms, the stomach often symbolizes the seat of desire or appetite. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of internal corruption, as seen in <a href="/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17-20</a>, where Jesus speaks about what comes from the heart defiling a person.<p><b>his food sours</b><br>The souring of food symbolizes the transformation of something initially perceived as good into something harmful. This reflects the biblical principle that sin, though initially appealing, ultimately leads to destruction. <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a> states, "Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel," illustrating the deceptive nature of sin.<p><b>into the venom of cobras</b><br>Cobras are often associated with danger and death in the Bible. The venom represents the deadly consequences of sin. In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>, the venom of serpents is used metaphorically to describe the bitterness and deadly nature of Israel's enemies. This imagery underscores the idea that sin's consequences are not only harmful but potentially lethal.<p><b>within him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the internalization of sin's consequences. It suggests that the effects of sin are not just external but deeply affect the sinner's inner being. This can be related to <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, which describes how desire, when conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when fully grown, brings forth death. The internal aspect highlights the personal and spiritual impact of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This backdrop helps us hear verse 14 as part of a larger warning: whatever a wicked person &#8220;eats&#8221;&#8212;whatever gains he swallows&#8212;will not stay pleasant for long. Cross references echo the same conviction: <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-20</a> pictures the wicked &#8220;swept away by terrors,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a> says, &#8220;Ill-gotten treasures profit nothing.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Initial Bite: Taking In the Delicacy</b><p>&#8226; The wicked &#8220;swallow&#8221; wealth, pleasure, and power as though it were a feast (<a href="/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a> notes the same pattern: &#8220;Food gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth is filled with gravel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-25.htm">Hebrews 11:25</a> reminds us of the &#8220;fleeting pleasures of sin.&#8221;<p>Sin often starts with an attractive taste.

Still, a time comes when the self-complacency of the wicked man is shaken. He experiences a failure of health or spirits. Then, suddenly, it is as if the meat that he has swallowed had been turned to poison in his bowels, as if the gall of asps were within him. Compare what Bishop Butler says of the sudden waking up of a man's conscience ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 2. p. 52). The ancients seem to have known that the poison of serpents was a strong acid, and therefore supposed that it was secreted by the gallbladder (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 11:37). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">yet his food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1453;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7717;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will sour</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(neh&#183;p&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2015.htm">Strong's 2015: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn about, over, to change, overturn, return, pervert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his stomach</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4578.htm">Strong's 4578: </a> </span><span class="str2">The intestines, the abdomen, sympathy, a vest, the stomach, the uterus, the heart</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the venom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4846.htm">Strong's 4846: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bitterness, a bitter thing, bile, venom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of cobras</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6620.htm">Strong's 6620: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a venomous serpent) perhaps cobra</span><br /><br /><span class="word">within him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;qir&#183;b&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7130.htm">Strong's 7130: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nearest part, the center</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/20-14.htm">OT Poetry: Job 20:14 Yet his food in his bowels (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/20-13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 20:13"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 20:13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/20-15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 20:15"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 20:15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
