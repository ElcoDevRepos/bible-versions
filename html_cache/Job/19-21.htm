In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, friendship was highly valued, and friends were expected to provide support during times of distress. Job's plea highlights the failure of his friends to fulfill this role. This phrase echoes the human need for empathy and understanding, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity."<p><b>for the hand of God has struck me</b><br>Job attributes his suffering to the direct action of God, reflecting the belief in divine sovereignty over all aspects of life. This phrase underscores the theological tension in the Book of Job regarding the nature of suffering and divine justice. The "hand of God" is a metaphor for God's power and authority, often used in Scripture to describe both blessing and judgment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Job's understanding of his plight as being from God sets the stage for the later revelation of God's purposes and the ultimate restoration, which can be seen as a type of Christ's own suffering and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He is not demanding solutions, only the warmth of shared sorrow. Scripture consistently exalts pity:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a> declares, &#8220;As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a> shows the Good Samaritan moved by pity to practical help.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> reminds us that our High Priest &#8220;is able to sympathize with our weaknesses,&#8221; establishing divine precedent for human empathy.<p>Job&#8217;s cry teaches that when suffering people ask for pity, they are echoing a theme God Himself models.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my friends</b><p>Job addresses those who should be closest. Friendship carries covenant-like expectations:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, &#8220;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a> urges believers to &#8220;carry one another&#8217;s burdens.&#8221;<p>Yet Job&#8217;s friends sit in judgment, mirroring <a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12-14</a> where betrayal by a companion cuts deepest. Christ reverses that pattern with, &#8220;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). True friends move toward pain, not away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have pity</b><p>Job repeats the request, underscoring urgency. Scripture often uses repetition for emphasis, as in <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>. His double plea reminds us:<p>&#8226; Mercy is to be continual (<a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>: &#8220;be compassionate and humble,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God never wearies of showing pity&#8212;<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a> pictures Him as a mother who &#8220;cannot forget the baby at her breast.&#8221;<p>When suffering persists, compassion must persist as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the hand of God</b><p>Job recognizes that behind secondary causes stands sovereign providence. He is experiencing what he previously confessed: &#8220;The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). Other texts echo this balance:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, God &#8220;forms light and creates darkness&#8230; brings prosperity and creates calamity.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/39-10.htm">Psalm 39:10</a>, David pleads, &#8220;Remove Your scourge from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand&#8221;.<p>God&#8217;s hand can discipline yet also uphold (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Acknowledging His hand gives believers permission to lament without surrendering faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has struck me</b><p>Job names his suffering honestly. Scripture never minimizes pain:<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/3-1.htm">Lamentations 3:1</a>, &#8220;I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of His wrath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> reminds, &#8220;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a> shows how affliction drives reliance on God &#8220;who raises the dead.&#8221;<p>Job&#8217;s wording anticipates the greater Innocent Sufferer, Christ, who was &#8220;stricken by God&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>) for our redemption. The blow against Job is temporary; the blow against Christ secures eternal hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/19-21.htm">Job 19:21</a> captures a threefold truth: sufferers need compassionate friends, honest lament must acknowledge God&#8217;s sovereign hand, and affliction&#8212;though real&#8212;is not the final word.

(Comp. <a href="/job/16-20.htm" title="My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears to God.">Job 16:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends</span>. On the enumeration of his various woes, Job's appeal for pity follows. We must not regard it as addressed merely to the three so-called "friends" (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>) or "comforters" (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>), Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. It is an appeal to all those who are around him and about him, whose sympathies have been bither to estranged (vers. 13-19), but whose regard he does not despair of winning back. Will they not, when they perceive the extremity and variety of his sufferings, be moved to compassion by them, and commiserate him in his day of calamity? <span class="cmt_word">For the hand of God hath touched me</span>. To the "comforters" this is no argument. They deem him unworthy of pity on the very ground that he is "smitten of God, and afflicted" (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); since they hold that, being so smitten, he must have' deserved his calamity. But to unprejudiced persons, not wedded to a theory, such an aggravation of his woe would naturally seem to render him a greater object of pity and compassion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/19-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Have pity on me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1468;&#1467;&#1452;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;n&#183;nu&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural &#124;
