In the context of Job, Eliphaz is accusing Job of wickedness, implying that the wicked are often taken away unexpectedly. This reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution, where those who live in sin face sudden destruction. The idea of being "snatched away" can be connected to the fate of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>, where they are cast down to ruin. It also echoes the suddenness of judgment seen in the days of Noah (Genesis 6-7), where the wicked were destroyed by the flood.<p><b>and their foundations were swept away by a flood</b><br>This imagery of a flood sweeping away foundations is reminiscent of the great flood in Genesis, which served as a divine judgment against widespread corruption and violence. The flood narrative is a powerful symbol of God's ability to cleanse and renew the earth, removing the wicked to establish a new beginning. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, floods were often seen as acts of divine intervention. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the foundation that cannot be swept away (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). The flood also prefigures the final judgment, where the unrighteous will be removed, and a new creation will be established (<a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
