The longing for shade symbolizes a desire for relief and rest from suffering. This imagery reflects Job's deep yearning for respite from his afflictions. Biblically, shade is often associated with protection and comfort, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>, where God is described as a protective shade. This phrase highlights the intensity of Job's suffering and his desperate need for divine intervention.<p><b>like a hireling he waits for his wages.</b><br>A hireling, or hired worker, in biblical times was someone who worked for a daily wage, often under difficult conditions. The anticipation of wages represents the hope for reward or relief after toil. This reflects Job's expectation for an end to his suffering and a just recompense for his faithfulness. The concept of waiting for wages can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>, where believers are encouraged to be patient for the Lord's coming, much like a farmer waits for the harvest. This phrase underscores the theme of endurance and the hope for eventual justice and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Job sees himself in that weary figure.<p>&#8226; Slaves in the ancient Near East worked from sunrise to sunset, with midday shade as their only brief reprieve. See <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>, where the LORD is called &#8220;your shade at your right hand,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, which describes a &#8220;man&#8221; (ultimately messianic) who will be &#8220;like the shade of a great rock in a thirsty land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s plea is not for luxury, but for a moment&#8217;s relief from relentless hardship. His boils, sleepless nights, and unrelenting grief are as merciless as the noon sun (<a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Shade also signals God&#8217;s protective presence (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>). By invoking it, Job hints that he feels exposed&#8212;bereft of the divine shelter he once enjoyed (<a href="/job/29-2.htm">Job 29:2-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a hireling he waits for his wages</b><p>&#8220;Like a hireling he waits for his wages&#8221; shifts the image from a slave&#8217;s craving for shade to a day laborer&#8217;s anxious watch for evening pay.<p>&#8226; Daily workers counted the hours, knowing <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a> required employers to pay &#8220;before the sun sets.&#8221; Their very survival depended on that prompt reward.<p>&#8226; Job likewise counts the hours, but instead of silver coins he expects an end to suffering (<a href="/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6-7</a>). He is certain that &#8220;my days are swifter than a weaver&#8217;s shuttle,&#8221; yet they bring no payout of rest.<p>&#8226; Scripture later applies the hireling motif to God&#8217;s faithful people awaiting just recompense: <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> warns oppressors who &#8220;defraud the hireling of his wages,&#8221; while <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> promises the righteous that &#8220;their deeds will follow them.&#8221; Job foreshadows that longing for a righteous settlement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Job stacks two vivid labor images to convey his misery. He feels like a slave straining for a sliver of shade and like a hireling staring at the horizon for overdue wages. Both comparisons emphasize unbearable toil, the brevity of relief, and a deep sense that justice&#8212;whether in the form of cool shade or earned pay&#8212;has been withheld. Job&#8217;s lament invites every sufferer to echo his honesty while ultimately trusting the LORD who promises true rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>) and unfailing reward (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a servant</span> (or, <span class="accented">a slave</span>) panteth for the shadow; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> longs for the shades of evening to descend and bring the day to a close. The slavery of Job's time was probably not unlike that of captive races in Egypt, so graphically portrayed in the early chapters of Exodus. The captive, working from morning to night at exhausting labour, would long intensely for the night to arrive, when his toil would come to an end. The inference is not drawn, but clearly is - so Job may be excused if he longs for death, now that he has reached old age, and that the work of his life is manifestly ended<span class="cmt_word">.
