This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, where the voice of the Lord is described as powerful and majestic, breaking cedars and shaking the wilderness. Thunder serves as a metaphor for God's power and majesty, reminding the listener of His sovereignty over creation. In Job, Elihu is emphasizing that God's presence and power are evident in the natural world, and thunder is a manifestation of His divine authority. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that nature itself testifies to the glory of God, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>.<p><b>even the cattle regard the rising storm.</b><br>In the agrarian society of the ancient Near East, people were closely attuned to the behavior of animals, which often served as indicators of impending weather changes. Cattle, with their heightened senses, would react to the approach of a storm, seeking shelter or becoming restless. This observation underscores the idea that all of creation is aware of and responds to God's movements. The mention of cattle also highlights the interconnectedness of creation and humanity's reliance on God's provision and protection. This phrase can be seen as a reminder of God's care for all His creatures, as reflected in passages like <a href="/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>, which speaks of God's provision for animals. Additionally, it points to the broader biblical theme of God's control over nature, as seen in Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, demonstrating His authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and power.

&#8220;The thunder declares His presence&#8221; (<a href="/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a>a) points to thunder as an audible testimony that God is near and active.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents thunder as God&#8217;s voice:<p>&#8211; &#8220;The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; At Sinai &#8220;there were thunders and lightning&#8221; when the LORD descended (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Elihu has already urged Job, &#8220;Listen carefully to the thunder of His voice&#8221; (<a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8211; When the Father spoke over Jesus, some in the crowd &#8220;said that it had thundered&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8211; John later sees flashes of lightning and hears peals of thunder around God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Every rumble in the sky is a reminder that creation has a Maker whose power and presence are real and immediate (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling attention to thunder, Elihu nudges Job&#8212;and us&#8212;to move from speculation about God to awe-filled acknowledgement of Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even the cattle regard the rising storm</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Even the cattle regard the rising storm&#8221; (<a href="/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a>b) shows that instinctive creatures sense approaching weather and respond appropriately.<p>&#8226; Other passages make the same point:<p>&#8211; &#8220;Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;The ox knows its owner&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; God asks Job, &#8220;Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God?&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>).<p>&#8226; If animals heed the signals God placed in nature, how much more should people, made in His image, heed His warnings and invitations.<p>&#8226; The line also humbles human pride: the lowliest creature possesses an awareness that sometimes surpasses ours when it comes to recognizing God&#8217;s handiwork (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Elihu&#8217;s contrast implies that Job and his friends should be at least as responsive to God&#8217;s movements as cattle are to an oncoming storm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Thunder announces God&#8217;s nearness, and even grazing animals respond to the signs of His power. <a href="/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a> urges us to open our ears and hearts: recognize the Lord&#8217;s presence in creation, submit to His sovereignty, and respond with the humble obedience that even cattle instinctively display when storms roll in.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The noise thereof sheweth concerning it.</span>--This verse is extremely difficult, and the sense very uncertain. We may translate the first clause, "The noise thereof (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the crash of the thunder) declareth concerning Him:" it is His voice, and speaks of Him; but the last clause is almost unintelligible. The words as they stand mean, or may mean, <span class= "ital">cattle even concerning a goer up; </span>but what this means who shall say? Possibly, <span class= "ital">the thunder-crash telleth the cattle even concerning Him who goeth up: i.e.</span>, even the cattle show, by their terror, that the thunder speaketh to them of God, who goeth up on high. (See <a href="/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-4.htm" title="Sing to God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rides on the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.">Psalm 68:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-5.htm" title="God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.">Psalm 47:5</a>.) Some render the last clause, "The cattle also concerning Him as He riseth up;" or, "The cattle also concerning the rising storm." There can be no doubt but that the general meaning is that all nature participateth in the terror caused by the thunder, which is regarded as the audible voice of God; but what the exact expression of this general thought may be it is very hard to say.<p>There should he no break between this chapter and the next.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise thereof showeth concerning it;</span> or, <span class="accented">concerning him.</span> The loud crash proclaims the fierceness of God's anger.

The rendering of the Revised Version, "(it showeth) the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up," is very weak, and unworthy of such an orator as Elihu. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/36-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The thunder</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7452.htm">Strong's 7452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps shouting, roar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(yag&#183;g&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[His presence];</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even the cattle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1437;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4735.htm">Strong's 4735: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something bought, property, livestock, acquisition</span><br /><br /><span class="word">regard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the rising [storm].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/36-33.htm">OT Poetry: Job 36:33 Its noise tells about him and (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/36-32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 36:32"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 36:32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/37-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 37:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 37:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
