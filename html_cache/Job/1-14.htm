This reflects the immediacy and personal nature of the message. The role of a messenger is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing the delivery of divine or critical information, as seen with angels in other parts of Scripture (e.g., Gabriel in <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>).<p><b>&#8220;While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</b><br>Oxen were essential for agricultural work in the ancient world, symbolizing strength and productivity. Plowing indicates a time of preparation and expectation for a harvest, which is a recurring biblical theme (e.g., <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>). Donkeys, known for their endurance, were valuable assets for transportation and labor. The mention of these animals highlights Job's wealth and the normalcy of his life before calamity struck. This setting underscores the suddenness of the disaster, as it occurs during routine, peaceful activities. The proximity of the animals suggests a well-organized and prosperous estate, reflecting Job's status as a "greatest man among all the people of the East" (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, known for his faithfulness to God despite severe trials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/messenger.htm">Messenger</a></b><br>An unnamed servant who brings news to Job about the calamities befalling his possessions and family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/oxen.htm">Oxen</a></b><br>Animals used for plowing, representing Job's wealth and agricultural prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/donkeys.htm">Donkeys</a></b><br>Animals grazing nearby, also part of Job's wealth and livelihood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_uz.htm">Land of Uz</a></b><br>The region where Job lived, often associated with the area east of Israel, though its exact location is uncertain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_sudden_calamity.htm">The Reality of Sudden Calamity</a></b><br>Life can change unexpectedly, as seen in Job's experience.

Oxen symbolize strength and productive blessing (<a href="/proverbs/14-4.htm">Proverbs 14:4</a>); their active plowing indicates prosperity already in motion (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Hardworking animals mirror Job&#8217;s own diligence (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1, 3</a>). What is lost is not idle wealth but fruit borne of faithful labor, similar to Elisha&#8217;s twelve yoke of oxen in <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>.<p>&#8226; This contrast&#8212;peaceful productivity interrupted&#8212;heightens the shock of the coming disaster.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the donkeys were grazing nearby</b><p>&#8220;and the donkeys were grazing nearby&#8221;<p>&#8226; Donkeys signify both wealth and service (<a href="/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>).

The juxtaposition anticipates Job&#8217;s own humble response once all is taken from him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14</a> captures the first ripple of a divinely permitted storm: a lone messenger breaks normal, prosperous routine with devastating news. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereign timing, Job&#8217;s transparent stewardship, and the fragile line between ordinary blessing and sudden loss. By recording each detail&#8212;messenger, report, plowing oxen, grazing donkeys&#8212;Scripture invites us to see both the reality of earthly vulnerability and the certainty of God&#8217;s overarching purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the she-asses</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>feeding beside them</span> (literally, <span class="accented">at their hand</span>). Note that, notwithstanding the festival, labour was still going on; there was no general holiday; the oxen were at work in the field, not perhaps all of them, but the greater number, for the ploughing-time is short in the Oriental countries, and the "earing" is all done at the same time. The bulk of Job's labourers were probably engaged in the business, and they had brought the asses with them, probably to keep them under their eye, lest thieves should carry them off, when the catastrophe related in the next verse occurred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">a messenger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
