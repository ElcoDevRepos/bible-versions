In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, showing compassion and weeping for others was a sign of righteousness and moral integrity. Job's weeping aligns with the biblical principle of mourning with those who mourn, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>. This phrase also reflects the character of Jesus Christ, who wept for Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>) and showed deep compassion for the suffering. Job's empathy serves as a type of Christ's own compassion for humanity.<p><b>Has my soul not grieved for the needy?</b><br>This phrase underscores Job's deep emotional response to the plight of the poor and needy, which was a significant aspect of his life before his trials. In the historical context, caring for the needy was a duty expected of the righteous, as seen in the laws of the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). Job's grief for the needy mirrors the heart of God, who is described as a defender of the poor and needy throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>). This also prefigures the ministry of Jesus, who proclaimed good news to the poor (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). Job's lamentation for the needy highlights his integrity and righteousness, contrasting with the accusations of his friends who suggest his suffering is due to sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

In the previous chapter he said, &#8220;I delivered the poor who cried for help&#8221; (<a href="/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>).<p>&#8226; His tears were real, not performative. Like David who &#8220;wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting&#8221; for the sick (<a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13&#8211;14</a>), Job&#8217;s sorrow identified him with sufferers.<p>&#8226; Scripture affirms this shared burden: &#8220;Weep with those who weep&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>) and &#8220;If one part suffers, every part suffers with it&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s words expose the irony of his present loneliness. He had been quick to comfort others, yet now, in distress, he receives no comfort from his friends.<p>&#8226; By recounting his past mercy, Job highlights the moral disconnect in the friends&#8217; accusation that his calamity stems from hidden sin (see <a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has my soul not grieved for the needy?</b><p>&#8220;Has my soul not grieved for the needy?&#8221; (<a href="/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a>b)<p>&#8226; Job goes deeper than outward sorrow; his &#8220;soul&#8221; ached for the poor. Compassion flowed from the heart, mirroring God&#8217;s own care: &#8220;He raises the poor from the dust&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7</a>).<p>&#8226; True godliness always includes such inner grief: &#8220;Blessed is he who is kind to the needy&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>); &#8220;If there is a poor man among your brothers&#8230; you shall open wide your hand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah links heartfelt concern with genuine worship: &#8220;If you extend your soul to the hungry&#8230; then your light will rise&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this standard: &#8220;Religion that is pure&#8230; to visit orphans and widows in their distress&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s interior grief underscores that his righteousness was not superficial; it sprang from love, challenging the notion that he now suffers because of a callous spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a> records Job&#8217;s testimony of lifelong empathy. He had both wept outwardly and grieved inwardly for people in hardship. Scripture consistently commends such compassion, making Job&#8217;s present isolation an unjust reversal of how he once treated others. The verse therefore strengthens Job&#8217;s claim to integrity: his suffering is not divine retribution for indifference but a mysterious trial permitted by God, inviting readers to trust the Lord&#8217;s justice even when the righteous hurt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Did not I weep for him?</span>--Job declares that he has not withheld that sympathy with sorrow and suffering for which he himself has asked in vain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do I claim a sympathy which I do not deserve?
