The north wind is associated with God's power and majesty, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, where the north is linked to the throne of God. The imagery of "golden splendor" suggests purity, holiness, and the unapproachable light of God's presence, reminiscent of the descriptions of God's glory in <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>. The use of "golden" also connects to the wealth and majesty of God's kingdom, as gold was a symbol of wealth and divine kingship in ancient cultures.<p><b>awesome majesty surrounds Him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of God's presence. The term "majesty" is often used in the Bible to describe God's sovereign power and authority, as seen in <a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>. The idea of being "surrounded" by majesty suggests that God's presence is all-encompassing and inescapable, reinforcing His omnipotence and omnipresence. This can be connected to the theophanies in the Old Testament, such as God's appearance to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>), where His presence was accompanied by thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud, signifying His awesome power and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering his perspective on God's majesty and justice.

In Scripture, the north often hints at the place of God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By observing the storm&#8217;s approach, Elihu invites us to look beyond the weather to the personal God who directs it (<a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9&#8211;13</a>). Nature is not random; it is an intentional display of God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal movement of the storm reminds us that God can break into human experience from any direction, yet retains sovereign control over creation (<a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He comes in golden splendor</b><p>&#8226; As sunlight breaks through the storm clouds, every icy particle glitters like gold. The scene pictures God&#8217;s glory radiating through His creation (<a href="/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold in Scripture marks purity and supreme value (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>). The gleam in the sky declares that God&#8217;s character is flawless and precious.<p>&#8226; Just as the sun&#8217;s rays pierce a snow-laden sky, God&#8217;s moral brilliance pierces the darkness of human suffering&#8212;a central theme in Job (<a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Awesome majesty surrounds Him</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;awesome&#8221; stresses that God&#8217;s presence is meant to elicit reverent fear (<a href="/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>). Elihu refuses to shrink God down to manageable size.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Majesty&#8221; emphasizes royal authority (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The rolling thunder, flashing light, and swirling snow form a living throne room around the King.<p>&#8226; For Job&#8212;and for us&#8212;the scene underscores that God&#8217;s greatness dwarfs our limited understanding. We bow before His unveiled power (<a href="/job/42-1.htm">Job 42:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; At the same time, the surrounding majesty is not distant. In Christ, the majestic God draws near, clothing Himself in humanity so we can behold His glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a> paints a literal storm rolling in from the north, its icy brilliance turning the heavens into a golden-tinted cathedral. Elihu sees more than weather; he sees God Himself advancing in dazzling purity, wrapped in royal splendor. The verse calls us to lift our eyes from our questions and sufferings, recognize the Creator&#8217;s overpowering presence, and respond with worshipful awe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fair weather cometh out of the north</span>; literally, <span class="accented">out of the north cometh gold.</span> The bearing of this is very obscure, whether we suppose actual gold to he meant, or the golden splendours of the sun, or any other bright radiance.
