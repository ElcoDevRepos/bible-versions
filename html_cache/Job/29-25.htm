The imagery of choosing a course suggests guidance and direction, akin to a shepherd leading his flock. This aligns with the biblical theme of wise leadership, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the importance of guidance for success. Job's position as chief indicates a role of authority and respect, similar to the elders at the city gates in ancient Israelite culture, who were responsible for making judicial and communal decisions (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>). This role is also reminiscent of Moses, who led the Israelites and made judgments on their behalf (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>).<p><b>So I dwelt as a king among his troops,</b><br>Here, Job compares his past status to that of a king among his soldiers, highlighting his influence and the respect he commanded. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings were seen as both military leaders and protectors of their people, responsible for their welfare and safety. This imagery evokes the biblical figure of King David, who was both a warrior and a shepherd of his people (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). The phrase suggests a sense of belonging and unity, as a king would be intimately connected with his troops, sharing in their victories and struggles.<p><b>as a comforter of the mourners.</b><br>Job's role as a comforter underscores his compassion and empathy, qualities highly valued in biblical leadership. Comforting mourners is a significant act of kindness and support, reflecting the biblical mandate to care for the grieving and brokenhearted (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>). This role can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the ultimate comforter and healer of sorrows (<a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>, <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>). Job's ability to comfort others also highlights his righteousness and integrity, as he was able to provide solace and hope to those in distress, embodying the love and mercy that are central to the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity, known for his patience and endurance through immense suffering.

Such is Job's pathetic lamentation over the days that were gone. He appears before us as a conspicuous example of one who had worn the poet's crown of sorrow in the remembrance of happier things in time of sorrow. He is the type and representative of suffering humanity, of man waiting for redemption, but as yet unredeemed. It is in this way that he points us on to Christ, who, Himself the Redeemer, went through all the sorrows of sinful and unredeemed humanity. He is able to describe his former state and all its glory and bliss, while his friends are constrained to listen in silence. They have said their worst, they have aspersed and maligned his character, but they have not silenced him; he is able to make the most complete vindication of all his past life, to contrast its happiness with the present contempt and contumely of it, so much owing to them and their heartless, unsympathetic treatment of him, while they can make no reply.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I chose out their way, and sat chief</span>.
