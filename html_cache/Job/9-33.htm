This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine-human relationships, where mediators such as priests or prophets often played a role. The longing for a mediator foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), who reconciles humanity to God. Job's cry highlights the human need for someone to intercede on their behalf, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>to lay his hand upon us both</b><br>The imagery of laying a hand upon both parties suggests a role of reconciliation and peace-making. In ancient cultures, the act of laying hands was symbolic of authority, blessing, or the transfer of power. This phrase underscores the need for a mediator who can represent both God and man, bridging the divine-human divide. This anticipates the role of Christ, who, being both fully God and fully man, is uniquely qualified to reconcile the two. The concept of a mediator who can touch both parties is fulfilled in the person of Jesus, who brings peace and reconciliation through His sacrificial death and resurrection (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
