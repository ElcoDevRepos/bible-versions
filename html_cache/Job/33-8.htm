In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is a younger man who waits to speak after Job's three friends have failed to provide satisfactory answers. The phrase suggests that Elihu has been attentively listening, which is a cultural expectation in ancient Near Eastern societies where respect for elders and careful listening were highly valued. This attentive listening is reminiscent of the biblical principle found in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, which encourages believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak."<p><b>and I have heard these very words:</b><br>Elihu claims to have accurately understood Job's statements, which is crucial for the integrity of his argument. This assertion of having heard "these very words" underscores the importance of truthfulness and accuracy in communication, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>, which speaks of the value of truthful witness. Elihu's role can be seen as a type of Christ in that he acts as a mediator, attempting to bring clarity and understanding, much like Christ mediates between God and humanity. The emphasis on hearing and understanding also reflects the biblical call to discernment, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s words have not been whispered or hidden; they were public and unmistakable (<a href="/job/32-11.htm">Job 32:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights that what proceeds from our mouths matters deeply&#8212;&#8220;The mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Elihu&#8217;s opening phrase signals respect: he does not distort Job&#8217;s statements but engages them head-on, modeling <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, &#8220;He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in my hearing</b><p>Elihu underscores that he was personally present and attentive.<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when Moses reminds Israel, &#8220;Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances I declare in your hearing today&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1</a>), stressing accountability for what is heard.<p>&#8226;

Elihu&#8217;s approach reflects that gravity.<p>&#8226; By repeating Job&#8217;s statements verbatim in verses 9-11, Elihu guards against straw-man arguments and illustrates the biblical principle of &#8220;speaking the truth in love&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8</a> captures Elihu&#8217;s respectful, careful approach: he listened closely, grasped Job&#8217;s actual claims, and now responds with precision.

Elihu models a godly pattern&#8212;hear first, understand fully, then speak truth&#8212;reminding us that every word matters before the Lord who hears all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - His exordium over, Elihu proceeds to point out what he blames in Job's discourses, and at present notices two departures from truth and right only. Job, he says, asserts his absolute innocence (ver. 9); he also maintains that God deals with him harshly, as an enemy (vers. 10, 11). Neither assertion is justifiable. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying</span>. Elihu does not quote exactly what Job had said. He probably intended to be perfectly fair and just, but in reality he greatly overstates the truth. Job had never said the words he ascribes to him in ver. 9; at best they are an inference, or deduction, from what he had said. And he had said a great deal on the other side, which Elihu overlooks (see the comment on ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/33-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1453;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have spoken</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my hearing,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - fdc &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_241.htm">Strong's 241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Broadness, the ear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I have heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#353;&#183;m&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these very words:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4405.htm">Strong's 4405: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a discourse, a topic</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/33-8.htm">OT Poetry: Job 33:8 Surely you have spoken in my hearing (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/33-7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 33:7"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 33:7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/33-9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 33:9"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 33:9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
