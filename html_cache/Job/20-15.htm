In the context of Job, it reflects the belief that those who accumulate wealth unjustly will ultimately find it unsatisfying. The imagery of "swallowing" wealth can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the futility of earthly riches, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, where it is stated that those who love money will never have enough.<p><b>but vomits it out;</b><br>The act of vomiting wealth indicates a forced expulsion, suggesting that ill-gotten gains will not remain with the wicked. This can be seen as a divine retribution where the wealth that was greedily consumed is forcibly removed. This imagery is consistent with the biblical principle that what is unjustly gained will not bring lasting satisfaction or security, as echoed in <a href="/proverbs/13-11.htm">Proverbs 13:11</a>, which speaks of wealth gained hastily diminishing.<p><b>God will force it from his stomach.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes divine intervention and justice. It is God who ensures that the wicked cannot retain their ill-gotten wealth. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and justice, where He acts to uphold righteousness. The imagery of God forcing wealth from the stomach underscores the inevitability of divine judgment. This can be related to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice, as seen in the story of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where God calls the man to account for his misplaced trust in wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
