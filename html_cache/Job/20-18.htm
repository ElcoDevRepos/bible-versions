In the context of the Book of Job, Zophar is speaking about the fate of the wicked, suggesting that they will not enjoy the fruits of their wrongdoing. This echoes the biblical theme found in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, where the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. The idea is that ill-gotten gains will not bring lasting satisfaction or benefit to the one who acquires them unjustly. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in moral order, where actions have consequences, and justice is ultimately served. Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God in ensuring that justice prevails, even if it is not immediately apparent.<p><b>he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the futility of dishonest gain. In the ancient world, trade was a common means of acquiring wealth, and it was often subject to ethical scrutiny. The inability to enjoy profits suggests a divine intervention where God ensures that the wicked do not find lasting joy in their ill-gotten wealth. This can be connected to Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The cultural context here involves the understanding that true prosperity and fulfillment come from righteous living and alignment with God's will, rather than from material wealth obtained through deceitful means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
