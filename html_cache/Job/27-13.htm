It reflects the belief that God, as the ultimate judge, dispenses justice according to one's actions. The "portion" implies a predetermined share or fate, suggesting that the wicked will inevitably face consequences. This aligns with the wisdom literature tradition, such as in Proverbs, where the wicked are often contrasted with the righteous. The idea of a "portion" also echoes the inheritance language found in the Old Testament, where land and blessings were allotted to the tribes of Israel, indicating a divinely ordained destiny.<p><b>the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.</b><br>The term "heritage" suggests something passed down or inherited, indicating that the consequences of wickedness are as certain as an inheritance. The "ruthless" refers to those who act without mercy or regard for others, often associated with oppression and violence. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the Ancient Near East, where power and wealth were frequently obtained through ruthless means. The use of "the Almighty" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, reinforcing the idea that divine justice is inescapable. This phrase can be connected to other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>, which assures that the wicked will be cut off, while the righteous will inherit the land. The concept of divine retribution is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the final judgment and the separation of the righteous from the wicked (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

We have seen that Bildad had but little to say, and that was only a few truisms; it is not surprising, therefore, that when it came to the turn of Zophar he had nothing more to say, and Job was left virtually master of the field. It is, however, a little remarkable that, supposing these words to be rightly ascribed to Job, he should precisely adopt those with which Zophar had concluded (<a href="/job/20-29.htm" title="This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.">Job 20:29</a>). Perhaps Job is willing to show how completely he is prepared to accept the facts of his friends, although he will not admit their inferences. He, like them, is quite ready to allow that the prosperity of the wicked must be seeming rather than real, and that it must eventually come to nought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the portion of a wicked men with God</span>.
