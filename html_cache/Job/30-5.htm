Biblically, being banished or cast out is a recurring theme, seen in the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>) and Cain's punishment (<a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12-14</a>). This reflects the severe consequences of sin or perceived unworthiness in ancient cultures. In Job's lament, he identifies with these outcasts, highlighting his fall from grace and the reversal of his fortunes.<p><b>shouted at like thieves</b><br>This phrase indicates the contempt and suspicion directed towards these individuals. In ancient times, thieves were often publicly shamed and subjected to harsh treatment, as seen in the laws of <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-4</a>, which prescribe restitution and punishment for theft. The public shouting suggests a communal rejection and a stripping away of dignity. Job's comparison to thieves underscores his profound sense of injustice and alienation, as he feels wrongfully accused and treated as a criminal despite his righteousness. This echoes the treatment of Jesus Christ, who was also unjustly accused and mocked (<a href="/matthew/27-38.htm">Matthew 27:38-44</a>), drawing a parallel between Job's suffering and the ultimate suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_outcasts.htm">The Outcasts</a></b><br>The individuals described in <a href="/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5</a>, who are marginalized and rejected by society.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel, possibly in Edom or northern Arabia.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who attempt to explain Job's suffering through traditional wisdom but fail to understand God's purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The overarching theme of the Book of Job, highlighting God's ultimate control and wisdom beyond human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rejection.htm">Understanding Rejection</a></b><br>Recognize that being marginalized or rejected by society does not equate to being rejected by God.

This is not poetic exaggeration; the text presents a real, physical expulsion, much like Cain&#8217;s banishment in <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a> or the removal of lepers &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; in <a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us of <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>, where any ritually unclean person had to leave the camp so the community remained undefiled. Job says these men now mock him, yet once suffered the fate of Israel&#8217;s own outcasts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a> echoes the same image&#8212;&#8220;May his children wander about, begging&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;showing that Scripture consistently ties moral or ritual stigma to social exile.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a> calls Moab&#8217;s fugitives &#8220;outcasts&#8221; who need shelter. The Bible never glosses over the pain of banishment, and here Job underscores its cruelty to show how far he himself has fallen in public opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shouted at like thieves</b><p>&#8226; Being &#8220;shouted at&#8221; implies a loud public warning, the same reaction Israel showed toward criminals (<a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>) or dangerous animals (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4-5</a>). No trial, no mercy&#8212;just instant, vocal rejection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> admits that even a starving thief is despised; society rarely distinguishes motive when it perceives danger to property or reputation.<p>&#8226; In Job&#8217;s day, calling someone a thief was enough to strip away every shred of dignity. <a href="/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a> describes the people as &#8220;scum and refuse&#8221; to the nations&#8212;similar public contempt.<p>&#8226; The mob&#8217;s shout foreshadows the crowd crying &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; at Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-21.htm">Luke 23:21</a>). Both scenes show how quickly human judgment can turn violent and how innocence offers little protection once the crowd&#8217;s verdict is sealed. Job isn&#8217;t claiming these men stole anything; he is showing that the very worst insults once hurled at them are now hurled at him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5</a> captures society&#8217;s harshest rejection: first the physical expulsion&#8212;&#8220;banished from among men&#8221;&#8212;then the verbal assault&#8212;&#8220;shouted at like thieves.&#8221; Scripture affirms both actions as literal realities faced by the marginalized throughout biblical history. By applying those images to himself, Job underscores the depth of his humiliation and the seeming injustice of his suffering, while reminding us that God alone judges rightly, even when human crowds do not.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were driven forth from among men</span>. Weak races retreat before strong ones, who occupy their lands, and whose will they do not dare to dispute. They are not intentionally "driven out," for the strong raecs would gladly make them their drudges; but they retire into the most inaccessible regions, as the primitive population has done in India and elsewhere. They cried after them as after a thief. Outcast tribes naturally, and almost necessarily, become robber-tribes. Deprived of their productive lands, and driven into rocky deserts, want makes them thieves and marauders. Then those who have made them what they are vilify and decry them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/30-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They were banished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1490;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1644.htm">Strong's 1644: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drive out from a, possession, to expatriate, divorce</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among [men],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#234;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1460.htm">Strong's 1460: </a> </span><span class="str2">The back, the middle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shouted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7321.htm">Strong's 7321: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mar, to split the ears, shout</span><br /><br /><span class="word">down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1437;&#1500;&#1461;&#1431;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#234;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like thieves,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(kag&#183;gan&#183;n&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1590.htm">Strong's 1590: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stealer</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/30-5.htm">OT Poetry: Job 30:5 They are driven out from the midst (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/30-4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 30:4"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 30:4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/30-6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 30:6"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 30:6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
