The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's will and emotions. The secret enticement suggests a hidden or private allure, indicating that idolatry can be a subtle and internal temptation, not just an external act. In the cultural context of Job's time, idolatry was prevalent, with many surrounding nations worshiping celestial bodies. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, which discusses how desire leads to sin. It also echoes the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, emphasizing the importance of worshiping God alone.<p><b>and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,</b><br>This gesture was a form of ancient worship or reverence, often directed towards idols or celestial bodies like the sun and moon. In Job's cultural context, such acts were common in pagan rituals. The act of throwing a kiss was a symbolic gesture of devotion or allegiance, similar to how people today might salute or bow. This phrase highlights the physical manifestation of idolatry, contrasting with the internal enticement mentioned earlier. It serves as a reminder of the importance of purity in both thought and action. This can be related to <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>, where Jesus speaks of honoring God with lips while the heart is far from Him, emphasizing the need for sincerity in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He has just said, &#8220;if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>). That outward gaze could have stirred an inward pull toward idolatry.<p>&#8226; The phrase admits that sin starts in the affections. James writes, &#8220;Each one is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own desires&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Job insists he never let that first flicker grow. Solomon urges, &#8220;Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God alone can see hidden motives: &#8220;Would not God have discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-21.htm">Psalm 44:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the danger, Job mirrors Jesus&#8217; teaching that inward sin is real sin (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>).<p>In short, Job testifies that he rejected the secret seduction of worshiping created lights, refusing to let inner fascination grow into allegiance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my hand threw a kiss from my mouth</b><p>Ancient worshipers often blew or &#8220;threw&#8221; kisses toward the sun, moon, or idols (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). Job declares he never acted out such homage.<p>&#8226; The gesture would have been a public act confirming private idolatry, directly violating &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> warns, &#8220;When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars&#8230; do not be enticed into bowing down to them.&#8221; Job aligns with that command.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a> later describes those who &#8220;worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator.&#8221; Job distances himself from that exchange.<p>&#8226; He knows that if he had performed even one symbolic kiss, &#8220;this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>).<p>So Job claims complete integrity: no outward sign of idolatry followed any inward lure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> highlights both the concealed and the visible dimensions of sin. He affirms that:<p>&#8226; He kept his heart from secret attraction to created splendor.<p>&#8226; He kept his hand and lips from any outward act of worshiping it.<p>By guarding both inner desire and outward deed, Job maintained exclusive loyalty to &#8220;God on high,&#8221; modeling wholehearted devotion that turns away from every form of idolatry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand</span>.
