The term "brothers" can also be seen as a broader reference to fellow believers or companions. In ancient Near Eastern culture, friendship and kinship were highly valued, and betrayal by such close relations would have been deeply painful. This phrase highlights the theme of betrayal and the failure of human support, which is a recurring theme in Job's lament.<p><b>are as faithless as wadis</b><br>A "wadi" is a dry riverbed that fills with water during the rainy season but can quickly dry up. In the arid climate of the Middle East, wadis were unreliable sources of water. Job uses this metaphor to describe the unreliability and inconsistency of his friends' support. This imagery is powerful in illustrating the disappointment and sense of abandonment Job feels. The faithlessness of his friends contrasts with the faithfulness of God, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, which speaks of a friend who sticks closer than a brother.<p><b>as seasonal streams that overflow</b><br>Seasonal streams, like wadis, are temporary and unpredictable. They can be abundant during the rainy season but disappear in the dry season. This imagery emphasizes the transient and unreliable nature of Job's friends' loyalty. In the broader biblical context, water often symbolizes life and sustenance, but here it represents the fleeting and unreliable nature of human promises. This can be contrasted with the living water that Jesus offers in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, which is eternal and dependable. The metaphor also serves as a reminder of the need for steadfastness and faithfulness in relationships, reflecting God's unwavering commitment to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Specifically, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who come to comfort Job but end up accusing him of wrongdoing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wadi.htm">Wadi</a></b><br>A valley, ravine, or channel that is dry except in the rainy season, often found in desert regions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seasonal_streams.htm">Seasonal Streams</a></b><br>Streams that flow only during certain seasons, typically after rain, and are unreliable sources of water.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_suffering.htm">Job's Suffering</a></b><br>The context of Job's lament, where he expresses his deep disappointment in his friends' lack of support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unreliability_of_human_support.htm">The Unreliability of Human Support</a></b><br>Just as Job's friends were like seasonal streams, human support can often be unreliable.

So when the writer saw the Gnadalquiver (or mighty wady) at Cordova, in August, it was a third-rate stream, running in many divided currents in its stony bed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my three friends," Eliphaz, who has spoken; Bildad and Zophar, who by their silence have shown their agreement with him. <span class="cmt_word">Have dealt deceitfully as a brook</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "a winter torrent" - a "wady," to use the modern Arab expression. These watercourses are characteristic of Palestine and the adjacent regions. "During the winter months," says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, "they are often foaming rivers; but in the hot summer, when they would be of priceless value, their dry bed is generally the road from one point to another. The water rushes over the sheets of rock as it would from the roof of a house, and converging, as it descends, into minor streams in the higher wadies, these sweep on to a common channel in some central valley, and, thus united, swell in an incredibly short time into a deep, troubled, roaring flood, which fills the whole bottom of the wady with an irresistible torrent... The streams from Lebanon, and also from the high mountains of the Hauran. send down great floods of dark and troubled waters in spring, when the ice and snow of their summits are melted; but they dry up under the heat of summer, and the track of the torrent, with its chaos of boulders, stones, and gravel, seems as if it had not known a stream for ages. So Job's friends had in former times seemed as if they would be true to him for ever; but their friendship had vanished, like the rush of the torrent that had passed away" ('The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 123-125). <span class="cmt_word">And as the stream of brooks they pass away</span>; or, <span class="accented">the channel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wady itself. Canon Cook well says on this, "The simile is remarkably complete. When little needed, the torrent overflows; when needed, it disappears. In winter it does not fertilize; in summer it is dried up. Nor is it merely useless; it deceives, alluring the traveller by the appearance of verdure, promising refreshment, and giving none." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[But] my brothers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1453;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are as faithless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_898.htm">Strong's 898: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cover, to act covertly, to pillage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;m&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3644.htm">Strong's 3644: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like, as, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a wadi,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5158.htm">Strong's 5158: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stream, a winter torrent, a, valley, a shaft</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as seasonal streams</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1508;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_650.htm">Strong's 650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Containing, a tube, a bed, valley of a, stream, a strong thing, a hero</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that overflow,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/6-15.htm">OT Poetry: Job 6:15 My brothers have dealt deceitfully as (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/6-14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 6:14"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 6:14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/6-16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 6:16"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 6:16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
