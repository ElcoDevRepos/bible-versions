This reflects the divine questioning found in <a href="/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a>, where God begins His response to Job's complaints. The phrase underscores the theme of divine wisdom versus human understanding. Job acknowledges that he has spoken without full comprehension of God's purposes. This humility is a key turning point in the narrative, as Job recognizes the limitations of human wisdom compared to God's infinite knowledge. The rhetorical question highlights the folly of attempting to understand divine plans without divine revelation, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human thoughts and ways.<p><b>Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,</b><br>Here, Job admits his lack of understanding. This confession is significant in the context of the book, as Job had previously defended his righteousness and questioned God's justice. The acknowledgment of his ignorance is a moment of repentance and submission to God's greater wisdom. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trust in the Lord rather than one's own understanding. Job's realization is a model of humility and repentance, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in the lives of figures like Peter in <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a> and Paul in <a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>.<p><b>things too wonderful for me to know.</b><br>The term "wonderful" in this context refers to things that are beyond human comprehension, often associated with God's miraculous works and divine mysteries. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges the overwhelming nature of God's knowledge. The phrase suggests that God's plans and purposes are not only beyond human understanding but are also inherently good and awe-inspiring. This ties into the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty and the mystery of His will, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-34</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. The acknowledgment of divine mystery points to the ultimate revelation of God's purposes in Jesus Christ, who embodies the wisdom and knowledge of God (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

But it is far more natural to regard Job as bringing up the words which God had spoken to him, to ponder on them and answer them, or at any rate to hang his reply upon them, than to imagine God twice interrupting Job in the humble confession that he was anxious to make.
