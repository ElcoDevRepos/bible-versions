In the ancient Near Eastern culture, extending a hand was a gesture of help and support. Job's lament reflects his perception that he is utterly forsaken by friends and community, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>, where the psalmist also feels abandoned. This sense of isolation is a common experience for those undergoing severe trials, emphasizing the need for compassion and support from others.<p><b>against a ruined man</b><br>The term "ruined man" underscores Job's complete devastation, both physically and socially. In the context of the book, Job has lost his wealth, health, and family, making him a symbol of utter ruin. This mirrors the plight of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who is also described as despised and rejected. The imagery of ruin can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was "a man of sorrows" and acquainted with grief, bearing the sins of many.<p><b>when he cries for help</b><br>Job's cry for help is a poignant reminder of human vulnerability and the innate desire for deliverance. In biblical history, crying out to God in times of distress is a recurring theme, as seen in the Israelites' cries during their Egyptian bondage (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). This cry is not just a plea for physical relief but also for divine justice and understanding, reflecting the deep spiritual struggle Job is experiencing.<p><b>in his distress</b><br>The word "distress" captures the intense suffering and emotional turmoil Job is enduring. This distress is multifaceted, encompassing physical pain, emotional grief, and spiritual confusion. The Hebrew concept of distress often involves a sense of being trapped or besieged, as seen in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>, where the psalmist calls upon the Lord in his distress. Job's distress can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's agony in Gethsemane, where He experienced profound sorrow and distress before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Some render it, "Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand; though it be in his destruction <span class= "ital">one may utter </span>a cry because of these things." Others, understanding the word rendered "ruinous heap" otherwise, render "Howbeit, God will not put forth His hand to bring man to death and the grave when there is earnest prayer for them, nor even when in calamity proceeding from Him there is a loud cry for them:" that is to say, "I know that Thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave, though Thou wilt not do so when I pray unto Thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so, but not in my time or according to my will, but only in Thine own appointed time, and as Thou seest fit." This is one of those passages that may be regarded as hopelessly uncertain. Each reader will make the best sense he can of it, according to his judgment. That Job should speak of himself as a <span class= "ital">ruinous heap </span>seems very strange; neither is it at all clear what "these things" are because of which a cry is uttered. Certainly the <span class= "ital">significance </span>given by the other rendering is much greater. "His destruction" must mean, at all events, <span class= "ital">the destruction that cometh from Him; </span>and if this is so, the sense given is virtually that of the Authorised Version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction</span>. This is one of the most obscure passages in the entire Book of Job, and scarcely any two independent commentators understand it alike. To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader. It will, per-Imps, suffice to select the one which to the present writer appears the most satisfactory. This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: "Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity." The same writer further explains the passage as follows: "I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/30-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stretches out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to a ruined man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1453;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
