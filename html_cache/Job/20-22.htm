In the biblical context, Job's friends, including Zophar who speaks in this chapter, often equate material wealth with divine favor and suffering with divine punishment. However, this statement challenges that notion by suggesting that even in abundance, one can experience distress. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true security and peace come from God, not material possessions (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). Historically, the ancient Near East was a region where wealth was often measured in livestock, land, and servants, and losing these could lead to significant distress. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that earthly treasures are temporary and can lead to spiritual peril (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>).<p><b>the full force of misery will come upon him.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the inevitability and completeness of the suffering that will befall the wicked. In the context of Job, Zophar is asserting that those who seem prosperous but are unrighteous will ultimately face divine retribution. This reflects the retributive justice theology common in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where actions are believed to have direct consequences (<a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>, <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>). The phrase "full force of misery" suggests an overwhelming and inescapable suffering, which can be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment that is fulfilled in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). This also points to the eschatological hope that God will ultimately set things right, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and finds its fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and relief from ultimate misery (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Zophar pictures the wicked man at the high-water mark of success&#8212;possessing &#8220;plenty&#8221; in outward goods, comfort, and security (<a href="/job/20-18.htm">Job 20:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns that abundance apart from God is deceptive: &#8220;When you have eaten and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12-13</a> shows the same temporary prosperity of the ungodly, while <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> cautions, &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse assures believers that worldly gain does not equal divine favor; God sees beyond the surface and sets a day for justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will be distressed</b><p>&#8226; Distress strikes precisely when comfort seems guaranteed, revealing that inner turmoil, not outward lack, marks divine judgment (<a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20-24</a>).<p>&#8226;
