In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends, who suggest that his suffering is due to sin. Job acknowledges the impossibility of contending with God, reflecting the belief in God's omnipotence and sovereignty. This idea is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, where the prophet warns against striving with the Creator. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often depicted gods as powerful beings beyond human challenge, reinforcing the notion of divine supremacy.<p><b>he could not answer Him</b><br>This part underscores human limitations in understanding and responding to God's ways. It reflects the biblical theme of God's inscrutability, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, which speaks of the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. The inability to answer God also points to the need for humility before Him, a recurring theme in wisdom literature. Historically, this reflects the ancient belief in the vast gap between divine and human wisdom, a concept prevalent in the wisdom traditions of the time.<p><b>one time out of a thousand</b><br>The use of "one time out of a thousand" is a hyperbolic expression to convey the rarity or impossibility of successfully answering God. This phrase emphasizes the vast difference between human and divine understanding. In biblical numerology, the number "thousand" often signifies completeness or perfection, as seen in <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>, where God owns "the cattle on a thousand hills." This suggests that even if given countless opportunities, humans would still fall short in comprehending or responding to God's purposes. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who bridges the gap between God and humanity, providing the ultimate answer to human suffering and sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
