This comfort is rooted in his faith and integrity. In the context of the ancient Near Eastern culture, where suffering was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure, Job's comfort is countercultural. His comfort is not in the absence of pain but in his relationship with God. This reflects the biblical theme that true comfort comes from God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>, where God is described as the "God of all comfort."<p><b>and joy through unrelenting pain</b><br>Job's joy amidst suffering highlights a deep spiritual truth that joy is not dependent on circumstances. This echoes <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a>, which encourages believers to consider it pure joy when facing trials. The phrase "unrelenting pain" underscores the intensity and persistence of Job's suffering, which is a central theme of the book. Historically, Job's experience reflects the human condition of enduring suffering and seeking meaning, a theme explored throughout Scripture.<p><b>that I have not denied the words of the Holy One</b><br>Job's steadfastness in holding to God's words is a testament to his faithfulness. In the biblical narrative, the "Holy One" refers to God, emphasizing His purity and separateness. Job's refusal to deny God's words is significant, as it shows his commitment to God's truth despite his circumstances. This mirrors the New Testament call to hold fast to the faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>. Job's integrity foreshadows the ultimate faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who perfectly upheld God's word even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This teaches us the importance of holding onto our faith during trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Job's comfort comes from not denying the words of the Holy One.

His comfort does not come from circumstances, friends, or inner optimism, but from the certainty that God&#8217;s character and promises stand firm (see <a href="/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a>, &#8220;This is my comfort in affliction, that Your promise has given me life&#8221;; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; By recognizing comfort as something God supplies, Job models what Paul later affirms: &#8220;the God of all comfort&#8221; meets us where nothing else can (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement proves that emotional relief is possible while questions remain unanswered. Comfort does not wait for full explanations; it rests in who God is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and joy through unrelenting pain</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;I would leap for joy in unrelenting pain&#8221; (<a href="/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>) joins two realities that seem incompatible&#8212;joy and agony. Scripture consistently pairs them:<p>&#8211; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;3</a> urges believers to &#8220;consider it pure joy&#8221; when facing trials because testing grows endurance.<p>&#8211; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6&#8211;7</a> speaks of rejoicing &#8220;though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s example shows that joy is not the absence of pain but the presence of hope. The unbroken nature of the pain (&#8220;unrelenting&#8221;) intensifies, rather than cancels, the possibility of rejoicing because joy is rooted in the Lord, not the loop of circumstances (<a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith looks beyond the present moment, echoing <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> where Jesus &#8220;for the joy set before Him endured the cross.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I have not denied the words of the Holy One</b><p>&#8226; The bedrock of Job&#8217;s comfort and joy is a clear conscience before God. He can say, &#8220;I have not denied the words of the Holy One,&#8221; meaning he has not rejected or distorted what God has revealed (<a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This integrity aligns with Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;Whoever confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). Endurance in faith under pressure signals authentic relationship with God (<a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Job values God&#8217;s word above personal relief or social approval. Like the psalmist who esteems God&#8217;s statutes more than gold (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9&#8211;10</a>), Job clings to divine truth as life&#8217;s highest treasure.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;Holy One&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s absolute purity and authority; denying His words would be denying reality itself. Job&#8217;s loyalty underscores the literal reliability of every divine utterance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a> reveals a threefold testimony: real comfort springs from God, unrelenting pain can coexist with genuine joy, and steadfast allegiance to God&#8217;s word is the anchor that holds both comfort and joy in place. Job&#8217;s confidence is not rooted in explanations but in unwavering trust that every word from the Holy One is true, sufficient, and worth clinging to&#8212;no matter how fierce the storm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Concealed</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>denied.

First, the comfort that the end was come, and that he would be spared further sufferings; and further, the still greater comfort that he had endured to the end, and not. denied nor renounced his trust in religion and in all the "words of the Holy One." Professor Lee sees here "the recognition of a future life, expressed in words as plain and obvious as possible" ('Book of the Patriarch Job,' p. 223). But to us it seems that, if the idea is present at all, it is covered up, latent; only so far implied as it may be said to be implied in all willingness to die, since it may be argued that even the most wretched life possible would be preferred by any man to no life at all, and so that when men are content to die they <span class="accented">must</span> be expecting, whether consciously or not, a life beyond the grave, and be sustained by that expectation<span class="cmt_word">. Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare;</span> rather, yea, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would exult in anguish that did not spare.</span> However great the pain that accompanied his death, Job would rejoice and exult in it, since by it his death was to be accomplished<span class="cmt_word">. For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for I have not denied</span> or <span class="accented">renounced.</span> It would be a part of Job's satisfaction in dying that he had not let go his integrity. Rather he had held it fast, and not renounced or abandoned his trust in God and in religion. "The words of the Holy One are the commands of God, however made known to man" (Canon Cook). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It still</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;
