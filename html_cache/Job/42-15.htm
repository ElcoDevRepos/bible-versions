In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical beauty was often seen as a sign of divine favor and blessing. The mention of their beauty serves to underscore the restoration and blessing that Job received from God after his trials. This restoration is not only material but also familial, indicating a return to a state of honor and prosperity. The emphasis on their beauty also reflects the cultural values of the time, where beauty was often celebrated and could enhance a family's social standing.<p><b>and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers</b><br>In the patriarchal society of the ancient Near East, it was uncommon for daughters to receive an inheritance alongside their brothers. Typically, inheritance rights were reserved for sons, who would carry on the family name and responsibilities. By granting his daughters an inheritance, Job demonstrates a radical departure from cultural norms, reflecting a sense of justice and equality. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament principles of equality in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither male nor female in Christ Jesus. Job's actions may also reflect the influence of divine wisdom and understanding, as he acts in a way that aligns with God's character of fairness and generosity. This decision by Job can be seen as a type of Christ, who grants all believers, regardless of gender, an inheritance in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and was ultimately restored by God.

Scripture presents this as a literal, observable fact&#8212;a mark of God&#8217;s lavish restoration after Job&#8217;s suffering (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-12</a>). Beauty here is a gift from the Lord, just as Rebekah&#8217;s and Esther&#8217;s beauty were noted in <a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a> and <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>. Yet God consistently reminds us that true worth is deeper than appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>). In Job&#8217;s daughters we see both: outward loveliness and the dignity of being honored by their faithful father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Could be found in all the land</b><p>Their beauty was unparalleled &#8220;in all the land,&#8221; signaling that the whole region could witness how completely God had reversed Job&#8217;s fortunes (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>). The verse invites us to notice God&#8217;s public vindication of His servant. After seasons of testing, the Lord delights to display His goodness so broadly that no one can miss it (<a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their father granted them an inheritance</b><p>In the ancient Near East inheritance normally flowed through sons (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">Deuteronomy 21:16-17</a>). Job, however, willingly gives his daughters a share of the estate, echoing the later ruling God gave regarding the daughters of Zelophehad (<a href="/numbers/27-6.htm">Numbers 27:6-7</a>). This generous act demonstrates Job&#8217;s renewed understanding of God&#8217;s grace: the God who freely blessed him prompts him to bless his children freely (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>). The literal distribution of property becomes a testimony to Job&#8217;s transformed heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Among their brothers</b><p>By placing the daughters &#8220;among their brothers&#8221; in the will, Job treats them as equal members of the covenant family. This anticipates the New Testament truth that in Christ, &#8220;there is neither male nor female&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>) and echoes the creation mandate where male and female are blessed together (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27-28</a>). It also embodies <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, which describes husbands and wives as &#8220;heirs together of the grace of life.&#8221; Job models a kingdom mindset in which every child receives honor, dignity, and tangible provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/42-15.htm">Job 42:15</a> records two striking facts: unparalleled beauty and an unprecedented inheritance. Both are literal manifestations of God&#8217;s restorative grace, publicly declaring that the Lord not only returned what Job had lost but elevated his family to a place of honor that reflected God&#8217;s own heart. The verse encourages us to celebrate God&#8217;s generous blessings and to extend that same generosity and dignity to everyone under our care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job</span>. Beauty has always been highly valued in the East; and Job would feel himself highly favoured in having three beautiful daughters. It may have been on account of their great beauty that their father gave them inheritance among their brethren, which was certainly an unusual practice in the East. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/42-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
