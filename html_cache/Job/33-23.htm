This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God using messengers to communicate His will to humanity, as seen with angels in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> and <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>. The role of a messenger is crucial in bridging the gap between the divine and human realms, emphasizing God's desire to reach out to individuals. This concept also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate messenger and mediator between God and man (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><b>one mediator in a thousand</b><br>The phrase "one mediator in a thousand" suggests rarity and uniqueness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, mediators were often seen as rare individuals who could intercede on behalf of others, whether in legal, social, or spiritual matters. This scarcity highlights the preciousness of having someone who can effectively communicate God's will and intercede for humanity. Biblically, this points to the singular role of Jesus Christ as the one true mediator between God and mankind (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), fulfilling the need for a perfect intercessor.<p><b>to tell a man what is right for him</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the mediator: to convey divine wisdom and guidance. In the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, the importance of understanding what is right and just is a recurring theme. The mediator's role is to provide clarity and direction, aligning with the biblical principle that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). This also reflects the prophetic role of Christ, who came to reveal God's truth and righteousness to humanity (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), guiding them in the path of salvation and right living.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

It is generally supposed that "the angel of the covenant" is meant, and that the whole passage is Messianic; but much obscurity hangs over it. The Jews certainly understand it Messianically, since they read it on the great Day of Atonement, and use in their liturgies the prayer, "Raise up for us the righteous Interpreter; say, I have found a ransom." Elihu's knowledge of an Interpreter, or Mediator, one among a thousand, who should deliver the afflicted man from going down to the pit, and find a ransom for him (ver. 24), is certainly very surprising; and we can scarcely imagine that he understood the full force of his words; but it cannot be right to denude them of their natural signification Elihu certainly did not mean to speak of himself as an "angel-interpreter, one among a thousand;" and it is not probable that he intends a reference to any merely human helper. <span class="cmt_word">To show unto man. his uprightness</span>;
