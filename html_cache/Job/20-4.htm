It suggests that the knowledge being referenced is well-known and should be understood by the listener. This approach is typical in the dialogues of Job, where friends often challenge Job's understanding and perspective.<p><b>that from antiquity</b><br>The term "antiquity" refers to ancient times, emphasizing the long-standing nature of the truth being discussed. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where wisdom was often seen as something passed down through generations. The idea is that certain truths are timeless and have been recognized since the earliest days of human history.<p><b>since man was placed on the earth</b><br>This phrase alludes to the creation narrative found in Genesis, where God places man in the Garden of Eden. It underscores the belief in a divine order established from the beginning of time. The placement of man on earth signifies God's sovereignty and purpose in creation. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of humanity's role and responsibility on earth as stewards of God's creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
