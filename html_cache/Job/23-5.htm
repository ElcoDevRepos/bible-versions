This reflects the human quest for divine wisdom and insight, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. In the context of Job, this longing for answers is set against the backdrop of his intense personal suffering and the silence of God. The phrase echoes the sentiments found in other wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>, where seeking understanding is portrayed as a noble pursuit. Job's desire to learn from God also prefigures the New Testament call to seek wisdom from above, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.<p><b>and consider what He would say</b><br>Job not only wants to hear God's response but also to ponder and reflect on it. This indicates a readiness to engage with divine wisdom, not just passively receive it. The act of considering God's words is akin to meditating on Scripture, as encouraged in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects the importance of not just hearing but understanding and applying God's word, as emphasized by Jesus in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>). Job's approach foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on being doers of the word, not hearers only (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
