In ancient Near Eastern culture, cattle were often seen as valuable for their utility but not for their intellect. This metaphor suggests a feeling of being undervalued or dismissed. The comparison to cattle may also reflect the agrarian society of the time, where livestock were a central part of life and economy. This sentiment echoes the broader theme in Job of human dignity and the struggle for understanding in the face of suffering.<p><b>as stupid in your sight?</b><br>The term "stupid" here implies a lack of understanding or wisdom. In the context of the Book of Job, wisdom is a central theme, with Job and his friends debating the nature of divine justice and human suffering. Bildad's question highlights the tension between human perception and divine wisdom. This phrase can be connected to other scriptures that discuss wisdom, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which states that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." The frustration expressed by Bildad may also reflect the broader human condition of seeking understanding in a world that often seems incomprehensible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

He hears Job&#8217;s earlier words (<a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2&#8211;3</a>; 17:4, 10) and feels dismissed.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows people longing to be heard and respected (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Bildad assumes Job&#8217;s suffering has clouded his judgment toward friends, forgetting that genuine love &#8220;believes all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that misjudging motives can deepen hurt (<a href="/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as cattle</b><p>Calling someone &#8220;cattle&#8221; pictures brute creatures that act on instinct, lacking moral reasoning.<p>&#8226; Similar imagery appears in <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12, 20</a>, where those ignoring God&#8217;s wisdom are likened to beasts that perish.<p>&#8226; Bildad flips the charge: Job sees him and the other friends as unthinking animals, yet Bildad believes Job is the one refusing reason (<a href="/job/18-2.htm">Job 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The deeper issue is pride versus humility. Scripture urges us to esteem others better than ourselves (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>), even when we believe they misunderstand us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as stupid in your sight</b><p>Bildad feels labeled &#8220;stupid&#8221; (slow-minded, ignorant).<p>&#8226; Job had lamented his friends&#8217; lack of insight (<a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4&#8211;5</a>; 16:2&#8211;3).<p>&#8226; Bildad now defends his intellect and theological footing, convinced his traditional view of retribution is correct (<a href="/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The clash warns us against measuring spiritual insight solely by circumstances (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1&#8211;3</a>). God&#8217;s wisdom often overturns human expectations (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> invites anyone&#8212;sufferer or counselor&#8212;to seek divine wisdom rather than trade accusations of folly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/18-3.htm">Job 18:3</a> captures Bildad&#8217;s hurt response to Job&#8217;s critique. Feeling disrespected, he asks why he and his friends are treated like irrational beasts. The verse exposes how pride, pain, and miscommunication can fracture fellowship. While Bildad&#8217;s theology will prove insufficient, his complaint cautions every believer to listen carefully, honor others, and seek God&#8217;s wisdom before judging hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Wherefore are we counted as beasts.</span>--Referring to Job's words (<a href="/job/13-4.htm" title="But you are forgers of lies, you are all physicians of no value.">Job 13:4</a>, &c., <a href="/job/16-2.htm" title="I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.">Job 16:2</a>, &c.). In this chapter there is a marked increase in his harshness and violence. It has, however, a certain resemblance to Job 8, inasmuch as Bildad works out a simile here, as he did there; and in <a href="/job/18-16.htm" title="His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.">Job 18:16</a> the two similes touch.

Job had spoken of his "miserable comforters" as "ungodly and wicked" (<a href="/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a>), without wisdom (<a href="/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>) and without understanding (<a href="/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>).
