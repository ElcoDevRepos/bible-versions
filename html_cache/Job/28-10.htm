The imagery of hewing channels suggests a meticulous and labor-intensive process, reflecting human ingenuity and perseverance. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for God's wisdom and the hidden depths of His creation, as referenced in <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>, where wisdom is compared to hidden treasures. The act of hewing channels also symbolizes the pursuit of understanding and knowledge, paralleling the spiritual journey of seeking God's wisdom.<p><b>and his eyes spot every treasure</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the ability to discern and recognize value, akin to the miner who identifies precious stones or metals. In a spiritual sense, it can be interpreted as the discernment given by God to perceive true worth, beyond material wealth. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The phrase also suggests God's omniscience, as He sees and knows all things, including the hidden treasures of the heart.

Some understand this of man's general ability to cut canals and tunnels, and change the course of rivers. But the allusion is more probably to the works undertaken in mines for the carrying off of the water from them. Diodorus says that when subterranean springs were tapped in mines, which threatened to flood them, it was usual to construct ducts, or tunnels, by which the inconvenient liquid might be carried off to a lower level (Diod. Siculus, 5:37. &sect; 3). <span class="cmt_word">And his eye seeth every precious thing</span>. Nothing escapes his notice.
