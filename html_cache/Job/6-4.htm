The imagery of arrows suggests precision and intentionality, implying that Job feels targeted by divine judgment. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages where God's judgment or discipline is depicted as arrows (e.g., <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>). The use of "Almighty" emphasizes God's sovereign power, a recurring theme in the Book of Job, highlighting the tension between divine omnipotence and human suffering.<p><b>my spirit drinks in their poison;</b><br>Here, Job intensifies the metaphor by describing the arrows as poisoned, suggesting that his suffering is not only acute but also deeply penetrating and potentially lethal. The idea of poison indicates a prolonged and pervasive affliction, affecting Job's entire being. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of suffering as both physical and spiritual. The concept of poison can also be seen as a metaphor for the bitterness of Job's experience, resonating with other biblical expressions of deep anguish (e.g., <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>).<p><b>the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</b><br>In this final phrase, Job speaks of the "terrors of God," which conveys a sense of overwhelming fear and dread. The term "arrayed" suggests a military formation, indicating that Job feels besieged by divine forces. This imagery underscores the intensity of Job's trials and his perception of being in a spiritual battle. The phrase reflects the broader biblical theme of the fear of God, which can denote both reverence and terror (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>). Job's lament here foreshadows the ultimate resolution of his story, where God's sovereignty and justice are affirmed, pointing to the eventual hope and restoration found in Christ, who bore the ultimate suffering on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He is saying, &#8220;The mark on my soul matches the markmanship of God.&#8221; David uses the same image&#8212;&#8220;For Your arrows have pierced me deeply&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>)&#8212;and Moses warns of divine arrows in judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s lament does not deny God&#8217;s goodness; it underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty. He knows exactly Who is behind the suffering and refuses to blame chance or human enemies alone (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; 2:10).<p>&#8226; When believers today feel wounded, this verse reminds us that even painful strikes come only with the Almighty&#8217;s permission and purpose (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My spirit drinks in their poison</b><p>&#8226; The wound is more than physical. Job feels the poison spreading through his inner being&#8212;bitterness, sorrow, exhaustion. Jeremiah used similar language when he said, &#8220;He has filled me with bitterness, He has drenched me with wormwood&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the passive role: &#8220;drinks in.&#8221; Job hardly has a choice; the venom is coursing through him. Yet he stays honest before God, refusing to sugar-coat his anguish (<a href="/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the verse legitimizes raw confession. When spiritual toxins of grief or disappointment seep in, Scripture invites us to pour it out before the Lord (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The terrors of God are arrayed against me</b><p>&#8226; Job sees his life as a battlefield lined with divine artillery. Every direction he turns, fresh waves of dread confront him (<a href="/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25&#8211;26</a>; 16:13).<p>&#8226; Still, the phrase &#8220;of God&#8221; signals hope wrapped inside horror. If God commands the terrors, God can also withdraw them (<a href="/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus experienced the ultimate terror for us, facing the Father&#8217;s cup in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). Because He stood in our place, no terror of God can ever separate the believer from His love (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38&#8211;39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a> paints a vivid, three-fold portrait of suffering: targeted arrows, inward poison, surrounding terrors. Job&#8217;s honesty shows that recognizing God&#8217;s hand in hardship does not cancel faith; it refines it. The same Lord who permits the wound also provides the cure and promises that every arrow, every drop of poison, and every fearful rank will serve His redemptive plan for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the poison whereof my spirit imbibeth, </span>the rendering of the Authorised Version being ambiguous.<span class= "bld"><p>Do set themselves in array against me.</span>--Like hosts marshalling themselves for battle. <span class= "ital">"</span>If the ox or the ass will not low or bray so long as he is satisfied, so neither should I complain if I had no valid cause.

So Shakespeare speaks of "the slings and <span class="accented">arrows</span> el outrageous fortune" for calamities generally. The metaphor is a very common one (see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23, 42</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-13.htm">Lamentations 3:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poison whereof</span>. Poisoned arrows, such as are now employed by the savage tribes of Central Africa, were common in antiquity, though seldom used by civilized nations. Ovid declares that the Scythians of his time made use of them ('Tristia,' 1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">Drinketh up my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my spirit drinketh up.</span> Job's spirit absorbs the poison that festers in his wounds, and therefore loses control over itself. This is his apology for his vehemence; he is well-nigh distraught. He adds<span class="cmt_word">, The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me</span>. Besides actual pains and sufferings, he is assailed by fears. God's terrors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the other evils that he has at his disposal, are drawn up against him, as it were, in battle array, and still further agitate and distract his soul.
