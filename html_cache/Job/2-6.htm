It reflects the divine council setting where God allows Satan to test Job. The phrase "Very well" shows God's control over the situation, emphasizing that nothing happens without His consent. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His control over both prosperity and disaster.<p><b>&#8220;He is in your hands,</b><br>This phrase signifies a transfer of authority, where God permits Satan to afflict Job physically. It highlights the spiritual warfare theme present throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded of the struggle against spiritual forces. The phrase also underscores the testing of faith, a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>, where trials are said to refine faith.<p><b>but you must spare his life.&#8221;</b><br>Here, God sets a boundary for Satan, demonstrating His ultimate authority and control over life and death. This limitation ensures that Job's trial will not lead to his death, reflecting God's protective nature over His people. The concept of God setting limits on evil is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, where God promises not to let believers be tempted beyond what they can bear. This phrase also foreshadows the protection and preservation seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who, despite suffering, was ultimately victorious over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God who permits Satan to test Job, demonstrating His ultimate authority and control over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary who challenges Job's integrity, seeking to prove that Job's faithfulness is contingent on his prosperity and well-being.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A blameless and upright man, known for his deep faith and righteousness, who becomes the subject of a divine test of faith and endurance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_court.htm">Heavenly Court</a></b><br>The setting where God and Satan engage in dialogue, highlighting the spiritual realm's influence on earthly events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_suffering.htm">Job's Suffering</a></b><br>The event where Job is afflicted with severe physical ailments, marking the beginning of his intense personal trial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_control.htm">God's Sovereignty and Control</a></b><br>God permits trials but sets boundaries, demonstrating His ultimate authority over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">The Nature of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Believers must recognize the reality of spiritual battles and the adversary's role in testing faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_trials.htm">Endurance in Trials</a></b><br>Job's account encourages believers to remain steadfast in faith, trusting in God's purpose and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limits_of_satan's_power.htm">The Limits of Satan's Power</a></b><br>Satan's power is limited by God's command, reassuring believers of God's protective oversight.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_circumstances.htm">Faith Beyond Circumstances</a></b><br>True faith is not dependent on material blessings but is rooted in a deep relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_2_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_2_6_God_s_control_over_Satan.htm">How does Job 2:6 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Satan's actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Job_2_6_God_s_protection_of_Job_s_life.htm">What does Job 2:6 reveal about God's protection of Job's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Job_2_6_s_comfort_in_trials.htm">How can Job 2:6 encourage us during personal trials and suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Job_2_6_1_Cor_10_13_on_trials.htm">Connect Job 2:6 with 1 Corinthians 10:13 about God's control over trials.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Job_2_6_s_role_in_trusting_God_s_plan.htm">How should Job 2:6 influence our trust in God's plan during hardships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_let_Satan_test_Job_5.htm">Why does God allow Satan to test Job in Job 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Job_2_6_God_s_control_over_evil.htm">What does Job 2:6 reveal about God's sovereignty over evil?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Does_Job_2_6_question_divine_safety.htm">How does Job 2:6 challenge the concept of divine protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_satan_need_god's_permission.htm">Must Satan obtain God's permission to attack us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_hedge_of_protection.htm">What defines a hedge of protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_did_god_permit_satan_to_test_job.htm">Why did God permit Satan to test Job?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/are_disorders_linked_to_demon_possession.htm">How are psychological disorders linked to demon possession?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Job 2:6 Mean</div><b>&#8220;Very well,&#8221;</b><p>- The phrase signals God&#8217;s deliberate permission.

The didactic purposes for which God was allowing his faithful servant to be tried in the furnace of affliction would have been frustrated by Job's removal from the earth.
