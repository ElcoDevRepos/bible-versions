The term "iniquity" refers to moral wrongdoing or sin. In the ancient Near Eastern context, iniquity was often associated with actions that violated divine law. Job acknowledges that certain actions, such as idolatry or injustice, are not just personal failings but offenses that warrant divine judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God is the ultimate judge of human actions, as seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, which states that God will bring every deed into judgment.<p><b>for I would have denied God on high</b><br>Denying God "on high" implies a rejection or renunciation of God's sovereignty and authority. In the cultural and historical context of the Old Testament, acknowledging God was central to the identity and faith of the Israelites. Denial of God could be equated with idolatry or turning to other deities, which was a serious offense. This phrase underscores the gravity of such an act, as it would mean turning away from the Creator. The concept of denying God is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against denying Him before others (<a href="/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>). This phrase also highlights the importance of faithfulness to God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and is exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

That honesty models living openly before the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I would have denied God on high</b><p>Why is idolatry so serious?

Job, though outside Israel, shares that revelation: God alone is &#8220;on high,&#8221; the supreme authority (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Denying God is not merely an intellectual stance; it is lived out whenever the heart yields ultimate allegiance to anything less than Him.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s refusal to do so confirms his integrity.

Job&#8217;s conscience is so tuned to the Lord that even the secret pull toward created splendor would, in his mind, constitute a denial of God Himself. His example urges us to guard our hearts from every rival to the worship that belongs solely to the God on high.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">By the judge.</span>--Rather, perhaps, <span class= "ital">by my judge, i.e., </span>God; unless, indeed, there be any reference to the Mosaic law (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/17-2.htm" title="If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has worked wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</a>), which does not seem likely.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge</span> (see the comment on ver. 11, <span class="accented">adfin.</span>).
