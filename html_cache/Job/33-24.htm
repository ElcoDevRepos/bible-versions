The concept of grace is foundational in Scripture, emphasizing God's unmerited favor towards humanity. In the context of Job, Elihu is speaking about God's willingness to show compassion. This aligns with other biblical passages such as <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>, which describes God as "merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love." The idea of God speaking or declaring His intentions is also significant, as it underscores the power and authority of God's word, seen throughout the Bible from creation in Genesis to the prophetic declarations in the New Testament.<p><b>&#8216;Spare him from going down to the Pit;</b><br>The "Pit" is often understood as a metaphor for Sheol or the grave, a place of death and separation from the living. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the Pit was feared as a place of no return, emphasizing the finality of death. The plea to "spare him" reflects a desire for deliverance and redemption, themes that resonate throughout Scripture. This echoes the psalmist's cry in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, "For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay," which is also seen as a messianic prophecy fulfilled in Christ's resurrection. The sparing from the Pit can be seen as a type of salvation, prefiguring the ultimate salvation offered through Jesus Christ.<p><b>I have found his ransom,&#8217;</b><br>The concept of a "ransom" is pivotal in biblical theology, symbolizing the price paid for redemption. In the Old Testament, ransom often involved a payment to free someone from slavery or debt, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48-49</a>. This idea is further developed in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the ultimate ransom for humanity's sins, as in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many." The notion of God finding a ransom for Job points to the divine initiative in salvation, foreshadowing the redemptive work of Christ, who is the fulfillment of all Old Testament types and shadows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

This grace is preventative as well as restorative.<p>&#8226; By stressing God&#8217;s initiative, the clause reminds us that salvation is never man&#8217;s idea first. <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> echoes the same heart: &#8220;While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spare him from going down to the Pit</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The Pit&#8221; points to the grave and ultimate judgment (<a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>). Left alone, every sinner descends there (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word &#8220;Spare him&#8221; reveals His power to interrupt that descent. Similar scenes appear in <a href="/psalms/103-4.htm">Psalm 103:4</a>, &#8220;He redeems your life from the Pit,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/38-17.htm">Isaiah 38:17</a>, where God &#8220;put all my sins behind Your back.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Deliverance is not merely physical rescue; it is spiritual salvation&#8212;&#8220;There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause underscores that salvation is a rescue operation, pulling a person from certain ruin into life (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have found his ransom</b><p>&#8226; A ransom is the price required to free a captive.

The verse anticipates the gospel, affirming that deliverance from death and reconciliation with God depend entirely on His grace, accomplished through the ransom ultimately revealed in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Then he is gracious unto him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, God is gracious; He accepts the mediation of the mediating angel.

But the angel is the natural subject. Deliver him from going down to the pit. The mediating angel thus addresses God, and adds, I have found a ransom, leaving the nature of the ransom unexplained. Some notion of ransom, or atonemeat, underlay the whole idea of sacrifice, which appears to have been universally practised from the remotest times, by the Oriental nations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/33-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to be gracious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;un&#183;nen&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
