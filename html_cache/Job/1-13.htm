It indicates a particular moment in time, suggesting the suddenness and unexpected nature of the events that follow. In the broader context of the book, it emphasizes the unpredictability of life and the trials that can come without warning.<p><b>while Job&#8217;s sons and daughters</b><br>Job's family is central to his life and wealth, reflecting the cultural importance of family in ancient Near Eastern societies. The mention of both sons and daughters highlights Job's prosperity and the blessings he enjoyed. It also sets the stage for the personal nature of the trials he will face, as they directly impact his loved ones.<p><b>were eating and drinking wine</b><br>This phrase suggests a time of celebration and fellowship, possibly a feast or a special occasion. In the cultural context, such gatherings were common and signified joy and abundance. The mention of wine indicates a festive atmosphere, which contrasts sharply with the calamity that is about to occur.<p><b>in their oldest brother&#8217;s house</b><br>The gathering at the oldest brother's house may imply a position of leadership or honor within the family, as the eldest often held a place of prominence.

The text never hints at debauchery; rather, it portrays normal, wholesome celebration.<p>&#8226; Their gathering highlights Job&#8217;s prior blessing: a united family living in harmony (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). Yet even in blessing we must remember life&#8217;s fragility (<a href="/luke/17-27.htm">Luke 17:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates that tests often strike at what we cherish most, pressing us to trust the Giver more than the gifts (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in their oldest brother&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226; The eldest brother hosted, reflecting ancient custom and firstborn leadership (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>).

The verse reminds us that every day is under God&#8217;s rule, that His blessings are to be enjoyed with thankful hearts, and that even the strongest earthly securities can vanish in a moment. Our confidence must rest not in the feast, the house, or the harmony, but in the Lord who gives and, at times, permits them to be taken away.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house</span>. One of the birthdays, the eldest brother's probably, had come round, and the ordinary gathering (see ver. 4) had taken place - the feasting and drinking had begun, while the father, remaining in his own house, was perhaps interceding with God for his children, or anxiously considering the possibility that, in their light-hearted merriment, they might have put God away altogether from their thoughts, and So have practically renounced him, when the series of calamities began. How often calamity comes to us when we are least expecting it, when all seems quiet about us, when everything is prospering - nay, even when a high festival-time has come, and the joy-bells are sounding in our ears, and our 'hearts are elated within us! Job was, at any rate, spared the sudden plunge from exuberant joy into the depths of woe. It was his habit to preserve an even temper, and neither to be greatly exalted, nor, unless under an extremity of suffering, to be greatly depressed. He was now, however, about to be subjected to a fiery trial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
