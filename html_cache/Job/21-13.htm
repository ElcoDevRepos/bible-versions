In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends who argue that suffering is a direct result of sin. Job counters by pointing out that many who reject God still enjoy prosperity. This challenges the retribution theology prevalent in ancient Near Eastern culture, which held that good is rewarded and evil is punished in this life. The prosperity of the wicked is also addressed in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the same issue, ultimately finding solace in God's ultimate justice.<p><b>and go down to Sheol in peace.</b><br>Sheol is the Hebrew term for the realm of the dead, often depicted as a shadowy place where all the dead reside, regardless of their moral standing. The phrase suggests that the wicked die without experiencing the turmoil or punishment one might expect. This challenges the simplistic view of divine justice and raises questions about the afterlife and God's timing in executing justice. The peace in death for the wicked contrasts with the suffering of the righteous, a theme that is explored throughout the wisdom literature. This tension is resolved in the New Testament, where eternal destinies are clarified, and ultimate justice is promised through Christ's return and the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the realm of the dead, a place where both the righteous and the wicked go after death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who engage in dialogues with Job, often suggesting that his suffering is due to sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and sovereign over all events, who later speaks to Job and his friends.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prosperity.htm">Prosperity</a></b><br>A state of success and wealth, often seen as a blessing from God in the Old Testament context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_earthly_prosperity.htm">The Illusion of Earthly Prosperity</a></b><br>Earthly wealth and success can be deceptive, leading individuals to a false sense of security.
