In the ancient Near Eastern context, clouds were often seen as symbols of divine presence and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, where God leads the Israelites with a pillar of cloud. The floating of clouds can also be seen as a metaphor for God's sovereignty and the mystery of His creation, as described in <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, where God is depicted as laying the beams of His chambers on the waters and making the clouds His chariot.<p><b>those wonders of Him</b><br>The wonders refer to the miraculous and awe-inspiring aspects of creation that testify to God's majesty and power. In <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>, God's wonders are described as great and unsearchable, indicating that they are beyond human comprehension. The wonders of God are also a recurring theme in the Psalms, such as in <a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>, where God is praised for performing wonders and displaying His strength among the peoples. These wonders serve as a reminder of God's active role in the world and His ability to work beyond human understanding.<p><b>who is perfect in knowledge</b><br>This phrase asserts God's complete and flawless understanding of all things, contrasting with human limitations. In <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>, God is described as a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed, highlighting His omniscience. The perfection of God's knowledge is also evident in <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, where it is stated that His understanding is unsearchable. This perfection is a key attribute of God, underscoring His ability to govern the universe with wisdom and justice. The concept of God's perfect knowledge is foundational to the biblical worldview, affirming that nothing is hidden from Him and that His plans are executed with perfect wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Scripture points to God as the engineer of weather: &#8220;He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them&#8221; (<a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>); &#8220;He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight&#8221; (<a href="/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>).
