The term "breath" can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it may refer to Job's physical condition, possibly indicating illness or decay that makes him undesirable. Metaphorically, it reflects the breakdown of intimate relationships due to his suffering. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a wife's support was crucial, and her repulsion signifies profound isolation. This mirrors the broader theme of Job's alienation from those closest to him, emphasizing his complete abandonment.<p><b>and I am loathsome to my own family</b><br>Here, Job laments his rejection by his family, which in the cultural context of the time, would have been a source of identity and support. The Hebrew word for "loathsome" suggests being detested or abhorred, indicating a severe breakdown in familial bonds. This estrangement highlights the social stigma associated with suffering and perceived divine disfavor. Job's experience foreshadows the suffering servant motif, where the righteous sufferer is rejected by his own, a theme later seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also despised and rejected by those he came to save (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). This connection underscores the idea of undeserved suffering and the hope of eventual vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

In <a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> his wife had already urged him to &#8220;curse God and die,&#8221; and now her revulsion underscores how completely Job&#8217;s suffering had invaded their relationship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5&#8211;11</a> echoes this experience: &#8220;My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness&#8230; my loved ones and friends stand aloof from my plague.&#8221; Scripture consistently affirms the reality that extreme affliction can alienate even our closest companions.<p>&#8226; Yet Job never curses God (<a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>). His complaint is not rebellion but an honest lament that recognizes the depth of human frailty while still clinging to divine sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I am loathsome to my own family</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points beyond his wife to his wider household&#8212;servants, relatives, even remaining community members&#8212;who now recoil from him. <a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a> observes, &#8220;My relatives have gone away; my close friends have forgotten me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Social rejection adds a crushing emotional burden to his physical pain. <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a> mirrors this: &#8220;I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother&#8217;s sons.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> foreshadows another righteous sufferer, &#8220;despised and rejected by men,&#8221; reminding us that Job&#8217;s isolation anticipates the ultimate innocent Sufferer, Christ Himself.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s friends still sit with him, but their counsel wounds more than it heals (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>). In being &#8220;loathsome,&#8221; Job experiences a foretaste of the Savior&#8217;s rejection, reinforcing that righteousness does not guarantee human approval.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores humanity&#8217;s propensity to withdraw from what it cannot explain or fix, challenging believers to offer compassion rather than distance when faced with another&#8217;s affliction (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a> captures the double edge of suffering: it devastates both body and relationships.

Scripture presents these details not as exaggeration but as literal truth, emphasizing the extremity of Job&#8217;s trial. Yet even in abandonment, Job&#8217;s integrity stands.
