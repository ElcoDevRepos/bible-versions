Job has just endured immense suffering, including the loss of his children, wealth, and health. The phrase "after this" sets the stage for a new section where Job begins to express his deep anguish. It highlights a shift from silent suffering to vocal lamentation, marking a pivotal moment in the book.<p><b>Job opened his mouth</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, opening one's mouth to speak was a significant act, often associated with making declarations or pronouncements. This phrase suggests that Job is about to articulate something of great importance. It also indicates a move from internal to external expression, as Job transitions from silent endurance to verbalizing his pain.<p><b>and cursed the day of his birth</b><br>Cursing one's birth was a profound expression of despair and hopelessness. In the cultural context of the time, life was considered a gift from God, and to curse one's birth was to question the very gift of life itself. This act reflects Job's deep suffering and his struggle to understand his circumstances. It connects to other biblical instances where individuals express similar despair, such as <a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>.

Is Jeremiah the germ of this? or is this the tree from which a branch has been hewn by Jeremiah? Our own conviction is that Job is the original, inasmuch as this chapter is indispensable to the development of the poem; but in Jeremiah the passage occurs casually as the record of a passing mood of despair. It is, moreover, apparently clear that Jeremiah is quoting Job as he might quote one of the Psalms or any other writing with which he was familiar. He was applying to daily life the well-known expression of a patriarchal experience, whereas in the other case the words of Job would be the ideal magnifying of a commonplace and realistic experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this opened Job his mouth</span>. The first to take the word is Job, as, indeed, etiquette made necessary, when the visit paid was one of condolence. It can only be conjectured what the feelings were which had kept him silent so long. We may, perhaps, suggest that in the countenances and manner of his friends he saw something which displeased him, something indicative of their belief that he had brought his afflictions upon himself by secret sins of a heinous character. Pharisaism finds it very difficult to conceal itself; signs of it are almost sure to escape; often it manifests itself, without a word spoken, most offensively. The phrase, "opened his mouth," is not to be dismissed merely as a Hebraism. It is one used only on solemn occasions, and implies the utterance of deep thoughts, well considered beforehand (<a href="/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>), or of feelings long repressed, and now at length allowed expression. <span class="cmt_word">And cursed his day</span>; "cursed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the "day of his birth." Some critics think that "cursed" is too strong a word, and suggest "reviled;" but it cannot be denied that "to curse" is a frequent meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> and it is difficult to see in Job's words (vers. 3-10) anything but a "curse" of a very intense character. To curse one's natal day is not, perhaps, a very wise act, since it can have no effect on the day or on anything else; but so great a prophet as Jeremiah imitated Job in this respect (<a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>), so that before Christianity it would seem that men were allowed thus to relieve their feelings. All that such cursing means is that one wishes one had never been born. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Job</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_347.htm">Strong's 347: </a> </span><span class="str2">Job -- a patriarch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6605.htm">Strong's 6605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open wide, to loosen, begin, plough, carve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mouth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
