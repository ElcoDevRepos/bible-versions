The mention of "seasons" suggests the cyclical nature of time and God's orchestration of the universe. This aligns with <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, where God establishes lights in the sky to serve as signs for seasons. The rhetorical question underscores human limitations compared to divine omnipotence.<p><b>or lead out the Bear and her cubs?</b><br>The "Bear" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, known in various cultures and often associated with a bear. The "cubs" likely refer to the stars that form part of this constellation. This imagery conveys God's intimate knowledge and guidance of the stars, akin to a shepherd leading a flock. The cultural context of the time saw constellations as significant, often linked to myths and stories. This passage dismisses human ability to control or influence such celestial phenomena, pointing instead to God's unmatched authority. The mention of the Bear and her cubs can also be seen as a metaphor for God's care and guidance, a theme echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>, where God is said to determine the number of stars and call them by name.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This makes it impossible to accept the meaning, so generally assigned, of "the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Again, the plural form is fatal to the conjecture that "Mazzaroth" designates a single star or planet, as Jupiter, Venus, or Sirius (Cook). The word is derived probably from the root zahar, "to shine," "to be bright," and should designate some especially brilliant cluster of stars Whether it is to be regarded as a variant of <span class="accented">Mazzaloth</span> (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>) is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</span> (On the identity of '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> with the Great Bear, see the comment on Job 9:9.)
