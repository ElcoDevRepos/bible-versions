His waiting signifies respect for the elders, a cultural norm in ancient Near Eastern societies where age was associated with wisdom. Elihu's patience also reflects a biblical principle seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which emphasizes listening before speaking. His entrance into the conversation suggests a new perspective, as he is not one of Job's three friends, indicating a fresh voice in the narrative.<p><b>because the others were older than he.</b><br>In the ancient world, age was often equated with authority and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>, which commands respect for the elderly. Elihu's deference to the older men aligns with this cultural expectation. However, his eventual decision to speak suggests that wisdom is not solely the domain of the aged, echoing themes found in <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>, where youth is not to be despised if accompanied by godliness. Elihu's role can be seen as a type of Christ, who also brought a new understanding and challenged established norms, emphasizing that true wisdom comes from God, regardless of age.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who enters the dialogue in the Book of Job.

The line taken by Elihu is an intermediate one, and is neither that of Job nor his friends. He admits the integrity of Job--or, at least, he does not deny it--although he uses very strong expressions as to the course which Job has adopted (<a href="/context/job/34-7.htm" title="What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?">Job 34:7-9</a>; <a href="/context/job/34-35.htm" title="Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.">Job 34:35-37</a>); but he considers that the Divine afflictions have a disciplinary object, and that they may be sent because God has discerned the seeds of unfaithfulness and defection in the sufferer; and this may serve to explain their purpose in the case of Job. He has very lofty ideas of the righteousness of God (<a href="/job/34-10.htm" title="Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.">Job 34:10</a>, &c.), and of His power and majesty (<a href="/job/37-22.htm" title="Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.">Job 37:22</a>). He holds that with regard to the Almighty we cannot find Him out, but that we may safely trust His mercy and His justice.
