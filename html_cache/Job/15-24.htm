In the context of Job, it speaks to the overwhelming suffering and fear that can accompany divine judgment or personal calamity. The terms "distress" and "anguish" are often used in the Old Testament to describe the consequences of sin or the experience of God's wrath (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>). The fear and terror are not just physical but deeply spiritual, indicating a separation from peace and security. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate distress faced by those who reject God, as described in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).<p><b>overwhelming him like a king poised to attack</b><br>The imagery of a king ready to attack conveys the idea of an unstoppable force. In ancient Near Eastern culture, kings were often seen as the ultimate authority and power, leading armies into battle with strategic precision. This metaphor suggests that the distress and anguish are not random but are as organized and inevitable as a military campaign. The use of a king in this imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as a conquering king in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>. However, unlike the distressing force in Job, Christ's reign brings justice and peace. The overwhelming nature of the attack highlights the totality of the experience, leaving no room for escape or relief, much like the comprehensive nature of God's judgment or the pervasive impact of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up accusing him of wrongdoing.
