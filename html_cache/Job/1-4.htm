The act of taking turns implies a sense of fairness and equality among the brothers. In the ancient Near Eastern context, feasting was a common practice for celebration and fellowship, often associated with significant events or religious observances. The mention of "homes" suggests that each son had his own household, indicating a level of wealth and independence. This reflects Job's prosperity and the blessings upon his family, as having multiple homes was a sign of substantial wealth.<p><b>and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them</b><br>The inclusion of their sisters in these feasts highlights the importance of family unity and the value placed on familial relationships. In the patriarchal society of the time, women were often excluded from such gatherings, so their inclusion here is notable and speaks to the respect and affection within Job's family. This practice of inviting sisters also underscores the theme of hospitality, a significant cultural value in the ancient world. The act of eating and drinking together symbolizes fellowship and peace, reflecting the harmony and joy within the family. This familial harmony contrasts with the trials that will soon befall Job, setting the stage for the narrative's exploration of suffering and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_sons.htm">Job's Sons</a></b><br>The sons of Job are central figures in this verse.

The verse underscores prosperity recognized as from the Lord, harmony maintained through mutual respect, and celebrations kept in check by ongoing concern for holiness.

"Went and feasted" seems to mean "were in the habit of feastlng" (Rosenmuller, Lee). In their houses. Each had his own residence, and the residence was not a tent, but a" house." Job and his sons were not mere nomads, but belonged to the settled population. The same is implied by the "ploughing of the oxen" (ver. 14), and indeed by Job's "yoke of oxen" in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Every one his day</span>. Most commentators regard these feasts as birthday festivities. Each son in his turn, when his birthday arrived, entertained his six brothers. Others think that each of the seven brothers had his own special day of the week on which, he received his brothers at his table, so that the feasting was continuous. But this scarcely suits the context. And it is admitted that "his day" (in <a href="/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>) means "his birthday." The celebration of birthdays by means of a feast was a very widespread custom in the East (see <a href="/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>; Herod., 1:133; 9:110; <a href="/mark/14-21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>). And sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. This by itself is sufficient to show that the feasts were occasional, not continuous. Constant absence of daughters, day after day, from the parental board is inconceivable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Job's] sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
