In the ancient Near Eastern context, dreams were often seen as a means of divine communication. However, Job's dreams are not comforting or enlightening; instead, they are a source of fear. This reflects Job's overall sense of being overwhelmed by his suffering and feeling abandoned by God. Theologically, this can be connected to the idea that God sometimes allows difficult experiences to refine and test faith, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a> with Pharaoh's troubling dreams, which ultimately led to Joseph's rise to power and the preservation of Israel.<p><b>and terrify me with visions</b><br>Visions, like dreams, were another common way that people in biblical times believed God communicated with them. However, Job's visions are terrifying rather than reassuring. This highlights the depth of his despair and the intensity of his trials. In the broader biblical narrative, visions often serve as a means of revealing God's plans or purposes, such as in the prophetic books (e.g., Daniel's visions in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>). Job's experience contrasts with these more typical uses of visions, emphasizing his unique suffering and the mystery of God's ways. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the Garden of Gethsemane, experienced deep anguish and distress, yet ultimately submitted to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

His cry is personal, revealing how deeply he feels God&#8217;s hand in his suffering (<a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Nighttime, normally a reprieve for the weary, has become another arena of torment. Compare <a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6&#8211;7</a>, where David weeps on his bed, and <a href="/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a>, &#8220;You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God has used dreams to communicate truth and warning (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; 41:25; <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>). Here, however, Job experiences dreams as fearful, underscoring how suffering can distort even God-given means of revelation.<p>&#8226; The language emphasizes God&#8217;s sovereignty: Job does not blame random chance; he recognizes that every part of life&#8212;including the subconscious&#8212;rests in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a> &#8211; 3).<p>&#8226; Though Job&#8217;s interpretation is anguished, Scripture confirms that the Lord does permit hard seasons for refining faith (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). Job&#8217;s honest lament becomes an invitation to trust that God&#8217;s purposes remain good, even when feelings scream otherwise (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and terrify me with visions</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and terrify me with visions&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Visions&#8221; normally signify divine revelation and guidance (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>; <a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10-12</a>). For Job, they have become frightening, reflecting the depth of his affliction.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;terrify&#8221; points to overwhelming dread. Similar fear struck Daniel when he beheld heavenly visions (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7-9</a>) and the disciples at Christ&#8217;s transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-6.htm">Matthew 17:6</a>). God&#8217;s holiness can unsettle even the righteous.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s response shows the tension between experience and theology. He knows God is just (<a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>), yet what he sees and feels seems contradictory. Habakkuk voices the same struggle (<a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord later clarifies His majesty (<a href="/bsb/job/38.htm">Job 38</a> &#8211; 41), reminding Job&#8212;and us&#8212;that His ways surpass human comprehension (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The terrifying visions ultimately drive Job to deeper humility and worship (<a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, Christ transforms fear into confidence. Because the Son has borne judgment (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>), visions of God&#8217;s glory become a promise, not a threat (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a> captures the raw edge of a righteous sufferer who finds no rest, even in dreams and visions ordinarily meant for blessing. He feels God&#8217;s nearness as frightening, yet still addresses Him directly, acknowledging divine sovereignty. Scripture echoes Job&#8217;s experience&#8212;saints from David to Daniel also trembled before God&#8217;s revelations&#8212;while steadily affirming that the Lord uses every circumstance, including unsettling ones, to refine faith and reveal His greater purposes. In Christ, the terrors of night are redeemed into confident hope, assuring us that even when dreams disturb and visions alarm, God remains faithful, purposeful, and ultimately good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then You frighten me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;it&#183;tat&#183;ta&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2865.htm">Strong's 2865: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prostrate, to break down, either, by violence, by confusion and fear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with dreams,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2472.htm">Strong's 2472: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and terrify me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1514;&#1463;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7791;an&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1204.htm">Strong's 1204: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall upon, startle, terrify</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with visions,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#7717;ez&#183;y&#333;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2384.htm">Strong's 2384: </a> </span><span class="str2">A revelation, dream</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/7-14.htm">OT Poetry: Job 7:14 Then you scare me with dreams (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/7-13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 7:13"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 7:13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/7-15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 7:15"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 7:15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
