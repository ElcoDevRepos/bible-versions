In the context of Job's suffering, it highlights the idea that God's actions and presence are often beyond human perception. This echoes the biblical theme of God's mysterious ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human understanding. The notion of God "passing by" can also be connected to <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>, where God passes by Moses, revealing His glory but not His face, emphasizing the divine nature that is beyond full human comprehension.<p><b>I would not see Him;</b><br>Job acknowledges the limitations of human senses in perceiving God. This aligns with the biblical teaching that God is spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>) and cannot be seen with physical eyes. The inability to see God is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, which states that God dwells in unapproachable light. This phrase underscores the idea that God's presence is real and active, even when it is not visible to human eyes, a concept that is central to faith (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><b>were He to move,</b><br>The movement of God signifies His active involvement in the world. In the historical context of Job, this could refer to God's sovereign control over creation and history. The idea of God moving is also seen in the Psalms, where God's actions are described as powerful and purposeful (<a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7-8</a>). This movement is not random but part of God's divine plan, which may not always be apparent to humans.<p><b>I would not recognize Him.</b><br>This phrase highlights the challenge of discerning God's work and presence in the midst of suffering and confusion. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's ways being hidden or misunderstood by humans, as seen in the story of the disciples on the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-32</a>), where they did not recognize Jesus until He revealed Himself. This inability to recognize God can also be seen as a call to deeper spiritual insight and reliance on faith rather than sight, as encouraged in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Here in words of great sublimity Job depicts the unapproachable majesty of God omnipotent, but invisible, and shows the utter hopelessness of entering into judgment with Him. Unfortunately, though this is a proposition to which all must assent, yet none is virtually so much repudiated or practically so often contravened. Men still cast about to justify themselves before God, and will do so till the end of time; but it is in teaching such as this that the Book of Job has laid the foundation of the Gospel by preparing for its acceptance by overthrowing man's natural and habitual standing-ground in himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not</span>. Near as God is to us, close as he comes to us, we cannot directly see him, or feel him, or perceive his presence. We know it by faith, we may feel it in our inmost spirits; but there is no manifestation of it to our senses. A sharp line divides the visible and invisible worlds; and this line, if it is ever crossed, is very rarely crossed. Job possibly reflects upon the pretension of Eliphaz to have had a physical consciousness of the visitation of a spirit (<a href="/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>), and asserts, with a tinge of sarcasm, that it is otherwise with him - the spirit-worm passes him by, and he receives no light, no illumination, no miraculous direction from it. <span class="cmt_word">He passeth on also</span>. The same verb is used by Eliphaz (<a href="/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15</a>) in speaking of his spiritual visitation. <span class="cmt_word">But I perceive him not</span>. Eliphaz perceived the presence of the spirit (<a href="/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>) and heard its voice (<a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16-21</a>).
