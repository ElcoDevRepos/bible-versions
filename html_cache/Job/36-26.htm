The greatness of God is often highlighted in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>) and is a foundational aspect of His character. In the context of Job, Elihu is reminding Job and his friends of God's incomprehensible majesty and power. This greatness is not just in terms of power but also in wisdom, love, and justice. The Hebrew word for "great" here can also imply "mighty" or "exalted," underscoring God's supreme authority over creation.<p><b>beyond our knowledge;</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the limitations of human understanding in comprehending the full nature of God. The Bible frequently acknowledges that God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). This is a humbling reminder of the finite nature of human wisdom compared to divine wisdom. In the context of Job, it serves as a rebuke to those who presume to fully understand God's purposes or question His justice. The mystery of God's nature is a recurring theme, pointing to the need for faith and trust in His divine plan.<p><b>the number of His years is unsearchable.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal nature, contrasting with the temporal existence of humans. The concept of God's eternity is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, where God is described as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. The idea of God's unsearchable years also points to His omniscience and omnipresence, qualities that are beyond human comprehension. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where gods were often seen as part of the natural order, the biblical portrayal of God as eternal and unbounded by time was revolutionary. This eternal nature of God assures believers of His unchanging faithfulness and sovereignty throughout all generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

It is suggested that the storm, which ultimately broke at the theophania (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>), was already beginning to gather, and turned the thoughts of Elihu in this direction. He begins with the consideration of how rain is generated, passes rapidly to the gathering of the clouds from all quarters, and thence to the loud crashing of the thunder, and the dazzling flashes of the lightning, which illumine even the lowest depths of the sea (ver. 30). The effects of the storm are then spoken of, in words the exact meaning of which is very obscure (vers. 31-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God is great, and we know him not</span>. This is the final lesson which Elihu seeks to impress on his hearers. God is so great their fully to comprehend him transcends the power of the human understanding. However much we know of him, there is more that we do not know. His nature is unsearchable; his depths (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) are inscrutable; try as we may, we can never "find him out" (<a href="/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither can the number of his years be searched out</span>. Even his duration, being eternal, is beyond us.
