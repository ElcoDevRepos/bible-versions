In the context of Job, this is part of Elihu's speech, where he describes how God uses suffering to turn people away from wrongdoing. Bread, a staple of life in ancient Near Eastern culture, symbolizes basic sustenance and survival. Detesting bread indicates a severe condition where even the most essential needs are rejected, highlighting the depth of Job's suffering. This can be compared to <a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>, where the psalmist's heart is "blighted and withered like grass," causing him to forget to eat his food, illustrating a similar state of despair.<p><b>and his soul loathes his favorite food</b><br>The phrase "his soul loathes his favorite food" suggests a profound inner turmoil that affects one's appetite and desire for pleasure. In biblical terms, the soul often represents the entire being, encompassing emotions, desires, and spiritual life. This loathing of favorite food signifies a loss of joy and satisfaction in life, a common theme in Job's lamentations. Culturally, food was not only for sustenance but also a source of joy and community in ancient times. The loss of appetite for favorite foods underscores the severity of Job's affliction. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who in His suffering, experienced deep anguish and rejection, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where He is described as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
