In the context of the Book of Job, it reflects the theme of human limitation in understanding divine purposes. The term "Almighty" (Hebrew: Shaddai) is used frequently in Job, highlighting God's supreme power and authority. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human understanding. The idea of God being beyond human reach also resonates with the New Testament, where Paul in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a> speaks of the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge as unsearchable.<p><b>He is exalted in power!</b><br>This phrase underscores God's omnipotence. Throughout the Bible, God's power is demonstrated in creation, miracles, and His sovereignty over nations. In Job, God's power is evident in the natural world, as seen in the preceding chapters where God speaks of His control over the elements and creatures. This connects to <a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>, which declares God's understanding as infinite and His power as great. The exaltation of God's power serves as a reminder of His ability to accomplish His will, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which are pivotal demonstrations of divine power.<p><b>In His justice and great righteousness</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's moral attributes. Justice and righteousness are central to God's character, as seen throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the Law given to Israel. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> describes God as a "God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He." The prophets, such as Isaiah and Amos, frequently call Israel to reflect God's justice and righteousness in their society. In the New Testament, these attributes are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's righteousness and brings justice through His sacrificial death and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>.<p><b>He does not oppress.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's fairness and benevolence. Unlike human rulers who may abuse power, God's use of power is always just and for the good of His creation. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God is portrayed as a defender of the oppressed and a judge of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6</a>. The assurance that God does not oppress provides comfort to believers, affirming that His actions are always motivated by love and justice. This is further exemplified in the life of Jesus, who, in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, invites the weary and burdened to find rest in Him, demonstrating God's gentle and humble heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and sought understanding of God's ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's majesty and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_almighty.htm">The Almighty (God)</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, whose power, justice, and righteousness are beyond human comprehension.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavens.htm">The Heavens</a></b><br>Often referenced in Job as a symbol of God's majesty and the vastness of His creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_of_job.htm">The Suffering of Job</a></b><br>The context in which this verse is spoken, highlighting the struggle to understand divine justice amidst human suffering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_incomprehensible_nature.htm">God's Incomprehensible Nature</a></b><br>We must acknowledge that God's ways and thoughts are beyond human understanding.

Awareness of His transcendence fuels reverence and worship, anchoring us when suffering feels inexplicable, as it did for Job.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is exalted in power!</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power is unequaled and unthreatened. <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a> declares, &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD! You have made the heavens and the earth&#8230; Nothing is too difficult for You!&#8221;<p>&#8226; His power sustains creation (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>) and governs history (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>). For the believer, that same power raises us with Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing God&#8217;s omnipotence assures us that no circumstance&#8212;however chaotic&#8212;lies outside His control (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>). Job needed that assurance while sitting in ashes; so do we when life feels fragile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress</b><p>&#8226; Power without goodness would be terrifying, but Scripture presents a God whose might is matched by moral perfection. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> proclaims, &#8220;He is the Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;He does not oppress&#8221; means His judgments are never arbitrary or cruel (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). Even discipline flows from righteous love (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice culminates at the cross where He remained &#8220;just and the justifier&#8221; of those who trust Jesus (<a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>). The innocent Sufferer of Calvary resolves the tension Job felt: the Almighty can both judge sin and rescue sinners without compromising righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a> gathers three stabilizing truths: God is transcendent, all-powerful, and perfectly just. Because He is beyond our reach, we revere Him; because He is exalted in power, we trust Him; because He is righteous and never oppressive, we rest in His goodness&#8212;especially when life, like Job&#8217;s, raises more questions than answers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out.</span>--He is excellent, or mighty, in power and justice, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out</span>.
