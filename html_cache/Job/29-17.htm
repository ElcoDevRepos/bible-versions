In ancient Near Eastern culture, the imagery of "shattering fangs" suggests a powerful act of disabling a predator, symbolizing the defeat of those who exploit or oppress others. The "unjust" refers to individuals who act wickedly, often at the expense of the vulnerable. Job's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate defender of the oppressed and who will one day bring perfect justice (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>). The imagery of breaking fangs also connects to <a href="/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>, where David prays for God to break the teeth of the wicked, emphasizing divine intervention against evil.<p><b>and snatched the prey from his teeth.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights Job's active intervention to rescue those who are being wronged. The "prey" symbolizes the victims of injustice, often the poor and needy, whom Job sought to protect. This reflects the biblical mandate to care for the marginalized, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>, which calls for speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves. The act of "snatching" suggests urgency and determination, akin to the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>, who lays down His life for the sheep, rescuing them from harm. This imagery underscores the importance of advocacy and protection for the vulnerable, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This is not exaggeration; Scripture records Job&#8217;s words as factual testimony. Think of David describing God&#8217;s help against the lion and bear (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>); righteous action often involves forceful intervention. <a href="/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a> echoes the same imagery: &#8220;You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.&#8221; Job acted in a way that mirrored the Lord&#8217;s own deliverance&#8212;swift, firm, and effective.<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Righteousness is active, not passive.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people sometimes must confront evil directly (<a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Shattering evil &#8220;fangs&#8221; keeps them from hurting others again (<a href="/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fangs of the unjust</b><p>The &#8220;fangs&#8221; picture the biting, tearing power of oppressors. By calling them &#8220;unjust,&#8221; Job identifies a moral issue, not merely a personal dislike. The wicked devour the vulnerable (<a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>). Job&#8217;s earlier testimony&#8212;&#8220;I delivered the poor who cried for help&#8221; (<a href="/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>)&#8212;shows he confronted real predators. His moral clarity reflects <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>: &#8220;Defend the fatherless.&#8221;<p>Points to notice<p>&#8226; Evil often wears respectable faces yet retains predator instincts.<p>&#8226; Identifying injustice is the first step to stopping it (<a href="/psalms/94-16.htm">Psalm 94:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The metaphor reminds us that unchecked sin seeks to consume (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and snatched the prey</b><p>&#8220;Snatched&#8221; suggests urgency. Job intervened before the victims became casualties. Jude 23 uses similar language: &#8220;save others by snatching them from the fire.&#8221; Timing matters; hesitation can cost lives, reputations, or faith.<p>Practical implications<p>&#8226; Be alert to windows of rescue (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Intervention may involve resources, influence, or personal risk (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Rescuing the &#8220;prey&#8221; models Christ, who &#8220;came to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from his teeth</b><p>Job didn&#8217;t just confront evil in principle; he pulled victims out of the predator&#8217;s mouth. This close-quarters rescue pictures victory at the very point of danger (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). God often meets His servants in that space&#8212;think of Abraham rescuing Lot (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14-16</a>) or Esther pleading for her people (<a href="/esther/8-3.htm">Esther 8:3-6</a>).<p>Encouragements<p>&#8226; Your proximity to need positions you for impact (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Courage grows when you remember that &#8220;The LORD is on my side; I will not fear&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when evil seems to have the upper hand, deliverance is possible and expected (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/29-17.htm">Job 29:17</a> portrays a righteous believer stepping between oppressor and victim, shattering the power of the unjust and rescuing those in immediate peril.
