In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is speaking to Job, suggesting that his suffering might be due to a lack of purity or uprightness. The concept of purity and uprightness is central to the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where a life aligned with God's commandments is often associated with blessings and favor. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which speak of the pure in heart being able to stand in God's holy place. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on moral integrity, often equating it with divine favor.<p><b>even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf</b><br>This suggests that God is attentive and responsive to the actions and character of individuals. The idea of God rousing Himself implies a divine intervention or action in response to human behavior. This reflects the belief in a personal God who is actively involved in the lives of His people, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The phrase can be connected to other scriptures where God is depicted as a defender and helper of the righteous, such as <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, which describes God as a refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.<p><b>and restore your righteous estate</b><br>Restoration is a key theme in the Bible, often associated with God's justice and mercy. The concept of a "righteous estate" implies a return to a state of blessing and favor that is in line with God's will. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who restores humanity to a right relationship with God. The historical context of Job's story, set in a patriarchal society, would view material and social restoration as evidence of divine approval. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of restoration, as seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, where God promises to restore the years the locusts have eaten.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This calls believers to examine their lives and strive for holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>While Bildad suggests suffering is a result of sin, the broader account of Job teaches that suffering can occur for reasons beyond human understanding. Believers are encouraged to trust God's sovereignty even when His ways are mysterious.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_restoration.htm">God's Justice and Restoration</a></b><br>Bildad's statement reflects a belief in God's justice and His ability to restore.

Purity positions a person to experience His nearness and help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And upright</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Upright&#8221; stresses integrity in action (<a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8211; It pictures straightness, the opposite of crooked schemes (<a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>).<p>&#8211; Job&#8217;s record earlier in the book already called him &#8220;blameless and upright&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>), showing that the standard is attainable by grace.<p>Key takeaway: Consistent obedience matters as much as clean motives; God notices both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf</b><p>&#8211; The phrase paints God as actively standing up for the righteous (<a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Even now&#8221; emphasizes God&#8217;s readiness; He is not distant or indifferent (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15-17</a>).<p>&#8211; In the larger biblical witness, God repeatedly &#8220;arises&#8221; to defend His people&#8212;see <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24-25</a> and <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7-11</a>.<p>Key takeaway: The Lord personally engages the moment His child&#8217;s need and His purposes intersect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And restore your righteous estate</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Restore&#8221; points to reversal of loss&#8212;common in Scripture (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25-26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Estate&#8221; (literally &#8220;habitation&#8221; or &#8220;home&#8221;) reflects comprehensive well-being: relationships, livelihood, honor (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>; <a href="/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Though Bildad applies the principle over-simplistically to Job&#8217;s situation, the promise stands: God ultimately vindicates the upright (<a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4-5</a>).<p>Key takeaway: God&#8217;s restoration is holistic, touching every sphere affected by suffering, and it is anchored in His righteous character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a> teaches the timeless principle that God favors purity of heart and upright conduct, stands ready to act for His people, and will ultimately restore what is lost. While Bildad misapplied this truth in assuming sin caused Job&#8217;s trials, the verse still affirms God&#8217;s active, righteous care for those who walk in integrity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">If thou wert pure and upright.</span>--Of course, then, there is but one inference: thou art not pure and upright. These are verily the wounds of a friend which are not faithful. Bildad brings to the maintenance of his point the experience of former generations. He wishes to be very orthodox in his assertions, and to base his statements upon authority, and he appeals to the experience of former ages long gone by, and calls them to attest the truth of what he says. He also, like Eliphaz, uses figures, and has recourse to metaphor, only his figures are highly obscure and admit of various explanations. We give that which seems to commend itself most to us. It appears, then, that Bildad contemplates two representative characters, the two which are so prominent throughout this book--namely, the righteous and the wicked. He depicts the latter first, and describes him under the likeness of the paper-reed, or rush that grows in the mire of Egyptian swamps, which, though surrounded with moisture, yet as a matter of fact is liable soon to wither: so is the wicked man, according to this moralist and philosopher. He is surrounded by mercies and blessings, but they avail him nought; he withereth in the midst of abundance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou wert pure and upright</span>. Job had asserted this, not in so many words, but substantially (<a href="/job/6-29.htm">Job 6:29, 30</a>). We have God's testimony that it was true (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>); not, of course, in the sense that he was absolutely free from sin, but in that qualified sense in which "just," and "righteous," and "pure," and "holy" can be properly used of men. Bildad implies, without boldly asserting it, that he does not believe Job to deserve the epithets, either absolutely or in a qualified sense. If he were so, Surely now he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) would awake for thee. This is a common anthropomorphism (see <a href="/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4, 5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>).
