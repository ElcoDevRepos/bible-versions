In the context of <a href="/job/39.htm">Job 39</a>, God is speaking to Job about the natural world, illustrating His power and wisdom through the example of the ostrich. The ostrich, despite its lack of wisdom, is part of God's intricate design. This reflects the biblical theme that God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The idea of God depriving a creature of wisdom can also be seen as a reminder of the limitations placed on creation, contrasting with the wisdom given to humans, who are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p><b>He has not endowed her with understanding.</b><br>This part of the verse continues to underscore the limitations of the ostrich, a creature known for its seemingly foolish behavior, such as leaving its eggs unprotected. The lack of understanding in the ostrich serves as a metaphor for human limitations in comprehending God's purposes. In the broader context of the Book of Job, this highlights the theme of human suffering and the mystery of divine providence. The absence of understanding in the ostrich can be paralleled with the human condition, where people often struggle to understand God's plans and purposes, as seen in Job's own trials. This phrase also connects to the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as Proverbs, which frequently contrasts human folly with divine wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, highlighting His sovereignty and wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/ostrich.htm">Ostrich</a></b><br>The animal referenced in this verse, known for its lack of wisdom and understanding, used as an example by God to illustrate His creation's diversity and His control over it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>The diversity in creation, including the ostrich's lack of wisdom, reflects God's sovereign design and purpose.
