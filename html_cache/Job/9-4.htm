In biblical context, wisdom is often associated with God's ability to create and sustain the universe (<a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19-20</a>). The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of intellect and emotion, indicating that God's wisdom is both perfect and compassionate. This aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, which speaks of God's understanding being unsearchable.<p><b>and mighty in strength.</b><br>God's strength is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting His omnipotence. This strength is evident in creation (Genesis 1), in His deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>), and in His ongoing sovereignty over the nations (<a href="/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6</a>). The combination of wisdom and strength assures believers of God's ability to execute His perfect will. This dual attribute is also seen in Jesus Christ, who is described as the power and wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<p><b>Who has resisted Him and prospered?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of opposing God. Throughout biblical history, those who have resisted God, such as Pharaoh (Exodus 5-14) and the nations opposing Israel (Psalm 2), have ultimately failed. This phrase serves as a warning and a reminder of God's ultimate authority and justice. It also points to the eschatological reality where every knee will bow to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>), affirming that resistance to God is ultimately in vain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
