Elihu is attempting to summarize Job's perspective, though he may not fully capture Job's intent. This reflects the ongoing dialogue and debate among Job and his friends about the nature of suffering and righteousness. Elihu's speeches are unique in the Book of Job as they attempt to offer a different perspective from the other friends, focusing on God's justice and sovereignty.<p><b>&#8216;It profits a man nothing</b><br>Elihu is suggesting that Job has implied that serving God brings no tangible benefit, especially in light of his suffering. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern belief that the righteous should be rewarded and the wicked punished. The idea of profit or gain from serving God is a recurring theme in wisdom literature, contrasting with the prosperity gospel notion that righteousness leads to material blessings. This phrase challenges the reader to consider the intrinsic value of righteousness apart from material gain.<p><b>that he should delight in God.&#8217;</b><br>Delighting in God implies a deep, personal relationship and joy in God's presence, beyond mere obedience or ritual. Elihu's interpretation of Job's words suggests a misunderstanding of Job's faith, as Job's lamentations are more about his confusion and pain rather than a rejection of God. This phrase invites reflection on the nature of true worship and devotion, which is not contingent on external circumstances. It echoes themes found in Psalms, where delighting in the Lord is associated with spiritual fulfillment and peace (e.g., <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>). This also foreshadows New Testament teachings on finding joy in Christ regardless of trials (e.g., <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

By beginning with &#8220;For he has said,&#8221; Elihu frames the following words as Job&#8217;s own conclusion about life with God.<p>&#8226; This signals a correction is coming, since Elihu thinks Job&#8217;s view is off&#8208;target (<a href="/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear earlier when Job voiced despair: &#8220;It is all the same; therefore I say: &#8216;He destroys both the blameless and the wicked&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11-13</a> the psalmist briefly echoes the same complaint before regaining perspective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It profits a man nothing&#8230;</b><p>Elihu claims Job now doubts any benefit from righteousness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Profit&#8221; speaks of gain, reward, or advantage; Elihu suggests Job sees no return on godliness (<a href="/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>; 35:3).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly affirms there is profit in fearing God (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The lament &#8220;It is futile to serve God&#8221; later reappears among disheartened Israelites (<a href="/malachi/3-14.htm">Malachi 3:14</a>), showing this temptation crosses generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;that he should delight in God.</b><p>The specific charge is that Job thinks delighting in God brings no benefit.<p>&#8226; Earlier Job pleaded for communion with God (<a href="/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3-6</a>), yet pain has pushed him toward cynicism.<p>&#8226; Delight in God is portrayed elsewhere as the highest good &#8212; &#8220;Delight yourself in the LORD, and He will give you the desires of your heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers find that delight centered in Christ, &#8220;in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elihu quotes Job to expose what he sees as a tragic misjudgment: concluding that loving God brings no gain. Scripture counters this by affirming that God rewards those who seek Him, both now and eternally. Feeling what Job feels is human; believing what Elihu corrects is error. The verse warns us not to let pain rewrite our theology but to keep trusting that delighting in the Lord is always profitable, because His character is steadfast and His promises are sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">It profiteth a man nothing.</span>--Comp. what Job had said (<a href="/context/job/9-20.htm" title="If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.">Job 9:20-22</a>; <a href="/context/job/9-30.htm" title="If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;">Job 9:30-31</a>; <a href="/context/job/10-6.htm" title="That you enquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?">Job 10:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/job/10-14.htm" title="If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me from my iniquity.">Job 10:14-15</a>). Eliphaz had virtually said the same thing, though the form in which he cast it was the converse of this (see <a href="/job/22-3.htm" title="Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? or is it gain to him, that you make your ways perfect?">Job 22:3</a>), for he had represented it as a matter of indifference to <span class= "ital">God </span>whether man was righteous or not, which was, of course, to sap the foundations of all morality; for if God cares not whether man is righteous or not, it certainly cannot <span class= "ital">profit </span>man to be righteous. On the other hand, Eliphaz had in form uttered the opposite doctrine (<a href="/job/22-21.htm" title="Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come to you.">Job 22:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God</span>. Again it must be remarked that Job had not said this. The nearest approach to it is to be found in <a href="/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, where this passage occurs: "It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked" (Revised Version). Elsewhere Job speaks, not generally, but of his own individual case, remarking that his righteousness has not saved him from calamity (<a href="/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17, 18</a>; <a href="/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>-17, etc.).
