These friends had come to comfort Job but ended up engaging in a series of dialogues with him, attempting to explain his suffering through traditional wisdom that equated suffering with sin. Their inability to provide a satisfactory answer to Job's plight highlights the limitations of human wisdom in understanding divine purposes. This moment sets the stage for Elihu, a younger observer, to speak. The silence of the three men signifies the exhaustion of human reasoning and opens the door for a new perspective, which Elihu believes he can provide. This transition is crucial as it prepares the reader for the divine speeches that follow, emphasizing that true wisdom comes from God alone.<p><b>his anger was kindled</b><br>Elihu's anger is directed at both Job and his friends. His anger towards the friends is because they failed to refute Job's arguments and thus did not uphold God's justice in Elihu's view. Anger in biblical terms often signifies a deep emotional response to perceived injustice or unrighteousness. Elihu's anger can be seen as a reflection of righteous indignation, a theme that appears throughout Scripture, such as in the actions of prophets who spoke against the injustices of their time. This phrase also foreshadows the divine speeches where God Himself will address Job, indicating that human anger and reasoning are ultimately insufficient without divine revelation. Elihu's role as a forerunner to God's voice can be seen as a type of Christ, who also came to correct misunderstandings and reveal divine truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who enters the dialogue in the Book of Job.

Up to this moment, Job and his three friends have traded speeches, and a pause settles over the scene. &#8220;But&#8221; alerts us that something different is about to happen, much like the narrative pivot in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a> where Joseph says, &#8220;But God intended it for good.&#8221; The contrast here sets the stage for Elihu&#8217;s emergence with a fresh perspective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he saw</b><p>&#8211; Elihu is not acting on rumor or hearsay; he observes the situation firsthand. Scripture often highlights the importance of seeing before speaking (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>). Elihu&#8217;s careful observation mirrors the discernment commended in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where the LORD looks on the heart rather than outward appearance. Elihu&#8217;s eyes take in the silence of the three friends, and what he sees shapes what he soon says.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That the three men</b><p>&#8211; The focus shifts to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar&#8212;the seasoned counselors who have already offered their lengthy arguments. Their earlier speeches claimed to uphold God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/bsb/job/4.htm">Job 4&#8211;25</a>), yet they could not persuade Job, nor answer his final words (<a href="/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>). <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a> reminds us that &#8220;two are better than one,&#8221; yet even three men together can falter when their understanding is limited.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had no further reply</b><p>&#8211; Their silence is significant. It suggests exhaustion of human wisdom (cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>) and underscores Job&#8217;s unresolved anguish. Silence after error can be a tacit admission of defeat, as seen when Jesus silences His critics (<a href="/luke/20-26.htm">Luke 20:26</a>). The friends&#8217; inability to continue also fulfills Job&#8217;s earlier challenge in <a href="/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>: &#8220;If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!&#8221; Ironically, silence now becomes their only option.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His anger was kindled</b><p>&#8211; Elihu&#8217;s righteous indignation flares, not petulant rage but zealous concern for God&#8217;s honor and Job&#8217;s welfare. <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a> speaks of zeal that &#8220;consumes.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a> records Jesus looking on in anger at hardened hearts. Elihu&#8217;s burning anger foreshadows his coming rebuke (<a href="/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6&#8211;22</a>), motivated by a desire to correct misunderstandings about God&#8217;s character. <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a> allows anger &#8220;yet do not sin,&#8221; and Elihu seeks that balance&#8212;passion harnessed to truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/32-5.htm">Job 32:5</a> marks the moment Elihu steps forward.
