The "cry of the poor" refers to the pleas and suffering of those who are oppressed and marginalized. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the poor often had little recourse against exploitation by the wealthy and powerful. The Bible consistently emphasizes God's concern for the poor and oppressed, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>. The idea that their cries come "before Him" underscores God's omniscience and His role as the ultimate judge who hears and responds to injustice. This reflects the biblical principle that God is attentive to the plight of the downtrodden, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-23</a>, where God warns against afflicting widows and orphans.<p><b>and He heard the outcry of the afflicted</b><br>This part of the verse assures that God is not indifferent to human suffering. The "outcry of the afflicted" signifies a deep, desperate plea for help, often associated with those who suffer unjustly. In the biblical narrative, God&#8217;s hearing is often a precursor to His action, as seen in the story of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). The term "afflicted" can also be connected to the suffering servant motif, which is a type of Christ, who is described in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> as one who bears the afflictions of others. This phrase reassures believers of God's justice and His promise to act on behalf of those who are wronged, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and righteousness.
