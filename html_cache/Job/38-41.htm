In biblical times, ravens were considered unclean animals (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>), yet God still provides for them, illustrating His impartial care. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>, which states that God gives food to the animals and the young ravens when they call. It also connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, where He uses ravens to illustrate God's provision, encouraging trust in God's care for humanity.<p><b>when its young cry out to God</b><br>The imagery of young ravens crying out to God underscores the instinctive dependence of all creatures on their Creator. This phrase suggests that even animals, in their need, are part of the divine order and rely on God's provision. The idea of crying out to God is a recurring biblical motif, often associated with prayer and supplication (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). It implies a natural recognition of God's role as sustainer, reinforcing the belief that all life is ultimately dependent on Him.<p><b>as they wander about for lack of food?</b><br>This phrase paints a picture of vulnerability and need, highlighting the precariousness of life in the natural world. The wandering of the young ravens can be seen as a metaphor for the human experience of searching and longing for sustenance, both physical and spiritual. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the human condition of seeking God's provision and guidance. The wandering also echoes the Israelites' experience in the wilderness, where they depended on God for manna (Exodus 16), symbolizing the spiritual journey of reliance on divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of divine wisdom and providence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/raven.htm">Raven</a></b><br>A bird mentioned in this verse, symbolizing God's provision for all creatures, even those considered unclean or insignificant in human eyes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty and Provision</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all creation, providing for even the smallest and seemingly insignificant creatures.

Earlier in the same divine speech, God asked Job about lions and mountain goats (<a href="/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39&#8211;40</a>), showing that every creature&#8217;s survival depends on the Creator&#8217;s daily care.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a> affirms this truth: &#8220;He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.&#8221; Jesus later applied the same thought to human anxiety, reminding His disciples, &#8220;Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap&#8230; yet God feeds them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting an unclean, seemingly insignificant bird (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>), God underscores that no living thing is beneath His notice. If He sustains ravens, He surely sustains His people (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When its young cry out to God</b><p>&#8226; The nestlings are portrayed as instinctively &#8220;crying out to God.&#8221; Creation itself recognizes its Maker&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27&#8211;28</a>). Even without conscious theology, the ravens&#8217; hunger directs their appeal heavenward.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15&#8211;16</a> echoes this posture of dependence: &#8220;The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season.&#8221; The cry of the raven chicks confirms that dependence is woven into the fabric of life.<p>&#8226; For Job, who has been crying out in his own distress, the image is both comforting and corrective: the same God who hears fledglings also hears His suffering servant (<a href="/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As they wander about for lack of food</b><p>&#8226; The young ravens&#8217; desperate wandering pictures vulnerability. God draws Job&#8217;s attention to a scene of need, not abundance, to reveal His faithfulness in scarcity.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs &#8220;wandering&#8221; with God&#8217;s timely rescue (<a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4&#8211;9</a>). Even lions suffer hunger, &#8220;but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s care extends to the wilderness, reminding Job that divine provision is not limited by human boundaries or understanding (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a> teaches that the LORD personally sustains even the most overlooked creatures. The young raven&#8217;s cry, the act of wandering, and the provision that follows all proclaim God&#8217;s intimate, attentive sovereignty. If He feeds helpless birds, He is more than able to care for His hurting servant&#8212;and for us&#8212;no matter how barren the landscape may appear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">They wander for lack of meat.</span>--The second clause is not a direct statement, but is dependent on the previous one; thus: "When his young ones cry unto God, when they wander for lack of meat."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who provideth for the raven his food?</span> (comp. <a href="/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, "Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and <span class="accented">God feedeth them"</span>). God's mercy is "over all his works," not only over those whereof man sees the utility; but also over beasts of prey, and birds thought to be of ill omen. Especially he cares for the young of each kind, which most need protection. When his young ones cry unto God. So <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>, "He giveth to the beast his food, and to the <span class="accented">young ravens which</span> cry." The young ravens are driven to cry out, when they, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the parent birds, wander for lack of meat, and have a difficulty in finding it. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/38-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">provides</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1461;&#1451;&#1497;&#1491;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
