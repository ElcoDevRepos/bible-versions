In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends who have accused him of wrongdoing. Job maintains his integrity, emphasizing his adherence to God's commands. This mirrors the biblical theme of obedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, where the Israelites are instructed not to turn aside from God's commands. The phrase also highlights the importance of God's spoken word, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, where the psalmist treasures God's word in his heart to avoid sin.<p><b>I have treasured the words of His mouth</b><br>Job's use of the word "treasured" indicates a deep reverence and value for God's words, akin to the way one might cherish a precious possession. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, where oral tradition and spoken words were highly esteemed. The phrase can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/2.htm">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>, which speaks of seeking wisdom and understanding as one would search for hidden treasures. It also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on the Word, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word made flesh, underscoring the divine nature and authority of God's words.<p><b>more than my daily bread.</b><br>This comparison underscores the spiritual sustenance that God's words provide, surpassing even the physical necessity of food. In the historical context, bread was a staple of the ancient diet, essential for survival, making Job's statement all the more powerful. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, where it is stated that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. This idea is further reinforced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a> during His temptation in the wilderness, where He quotes this verse, highlighting the supremacy of spiritual nourishment over physical needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

In adversity, Job remains loyal to God&#8217;s command, cherishes every divine word, and prizes that word above his own sustenance. For believers today, the verse invites us to measure our devotion by the same standard: unwavering obedience, active treasuring of Scripture, and a conviction that God&#8217;s truth is worth more than life itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32-34</a>.

Them were "commandments" which Job recognized as having proceeded from God, and "words" which he looked upon as being the utterances of his mouth. This is strong evidence of a primeval revelation which, if not reduced to writing, had, at any rate, been handed down by tradition to Job's day. <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14-19</a> and Genesis 9:1-7 may afford the true explanation of this difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food</span>. This is scarcely strong enough. Job says, "<span class="accented">I have treasured up</span> <span class="accented">taken to myself</span>, <span class="accented">and preserved</span> the words of his mouth," either "more than my necessary food" or "more than my own law." If the former rendering be preferred, there is no need of explanation; if the latter, we must regard "my own law" as meaning "the law of my own mind, my own will, the will of the natural man" (Cook). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/23-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
