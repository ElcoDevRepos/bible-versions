Job's death signifies the end of his trials and the fulfillment of God's restoration. In biblical context, death is often seen as a transition to eternal life for the faithful, as seen in the hope expressed in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-55</a>. Job's life and death serve as a testament to enduring faith amidst suffering, reflecting the ultimate victory over trials through divine grace.<p><b>old</b><br>The mention of Job's old age indicates a life that was extended and blessed by God, a common biblical sign of divine favor and fulfillment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, longevity was associated with wisdom, honor, and God's blessing, as seen in the lives of patriarchs like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>) and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>). Job's old age underscores the restoration of his fortunes and the peace he experienced after his trials, aligning with the biblical theme that God rewards faithfulness.<p><b>and full of years</b><br>This phrase suggests a life that was not only long but also rich in experience and fulfillment. The expression "full of years" implies a life that was complete and satisfying, echoing the biblical ideal of a life well-lived in accordance with God's will. It reflects the restoration of Job's fortunes and relationships, as God blessed him with twice as much as he had before (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>). This fullness of life can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers abundant life to His followers (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Job's story, culminating in a life full of years, serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the hope of restoration for those who endure trials with steadfast faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man from the land of Uz, known for his righteousness and immense suffering.

And the great lesson of the history is the way in which the malice of Satan is foiled. He had insinuated that all service of God was interested and done for advantage. Job had clearly shown that he was capable of loving God even under the most severe afflictions; and the issue which was eventually brought about was no contradiction of this fact, inasmuch as it was entirely hidden from Job till long after his probation was ended, and therefore could have no influence upon his patience and faith. It is remarkable that Job is only twice mentioned in Scripture, once in the Old Testament and once in the New. Ezekiel was acquainted with Job's history (<a href="/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a>; <a href="/job/14-20.htm" title="You prevail for ever against him, and he passes: you change his countenance, and send him away.">Job 14:20</a>), and St. James (<a href="/job/5-11.htm" title="To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.">Job 5:11</a>) refers to him as a familiar standard of patience. It is evident, however, that the Book of Job was well known, from the many instances in the Psalms and elsewhere in which we find traces of the influence produced by familiarity with the language of the book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Job died, being old and full of days</span>.
