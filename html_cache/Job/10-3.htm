The idea of God being pleased with oppression is a rhetorical device, highlighting Job's confusion and pain. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, suffering was often seen as a result of divine displeasure. Job's lament challenges this notion, as he is a righteous man experiencing intense suffering. This phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of questioning divine justice, seen in Psalms and Lamentations, where the faithful cry out to God in times of distress.<p><b>to reject the work of Your hands</b><br>Here, Job refers to himself as the "work of Your hands," acknowledging God as his Creator. This phrase emphasizes the intimate relationship between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust. Job's use of this imagery underscores his feeling of abandonment, as he cannot understand why his Creator would allow such suffering. Theologically, this raises questions about the nature of God's involvement in human suffering and the purpose behind it, themes explored throughout the book of Job.<p><b>and favor the schemes of the wicked?</b><br>Job contrasts his own plight with the apparent prosperity of the wicked, a common theme in wisdom literature. This reflects the tension between the observed reality and the traditional belief that righteousness leads to blessing while wickedness leads to suffering. The prosperity of the wicked is also addressed in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with similar questions. This phrase challenges the reader to consider the complexity of divine justice and the ultimate fate of the wicked, which is addressed later in the book of Job and throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job is not denying God&#8217;s justice; he is struggling to reconcile his suffering with God&#8217;s character, much like Asaph in <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2-14</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere affirms that the Lord &#8220;does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>), so Job&#8217;s question exposes his confusion, not a settled theology.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God invites honest lament (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>) while remaining righteous (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to reject the work of Your hands</b><p>Job continues, &#8220;&#8230;to reject the work of Your hands&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; He sees himself as God&#8217;s handiwork (<a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>) and cannot fathom why the Creator would now discard what He so carefully formed.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s wording echoes <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>&#8212;if God once declared creation &#8220;very good,&#8221; how can He now cast it aside?<p>&#8226; The tension highlights an essential biblical truth: God may discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>) but never abandons His workmanship (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s limited perspective mistakes divine silence for rejection, a theme echoed later when the Lord answers out of the whirlwind and reaffirms His authority (<a href="/bsb/job/38.htm">Job 38&#8211;41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and favor the schemes of the wicked?</b><p>Finally, Job asks why God would &#8220;&#8230;favor the schemes of the wicked?&#8221;.<p>&#8226; From Job&#8217;s vantage point, the righteous suffer while the wicked prosper&#8212;an age-old dilemma addressed in <a href="/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1-13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>.<p>&#8226; He wonders whether God&#8217;s providence inadvertently rewards evil. Yet Scripture clarifies that apparent success is temporary; &#8220;their feet slip&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>) and the Lord &#8220;will by no means leave the guilty unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s question underscores his longing for moral clarity, anticipating God&#8217;s ultimate vindication (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-17</a>) and foreshadowing the cross, where justice and mercy meet (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a> captures a believer&#8217;s honest perplexity in the face of severe trial. Job knows God is sovereign, purposeful, and good, yet his circumstances seem to contradict those truths. By asking whether God delights in oppression, rejects His own creation, or favors the wicked, Job exposes the tension between lived experience and revealed character. Scripturally, the answer is clear: God never delights in injustice, never discards His workmanship, and never ultimately rewards evil. The verse invites us to bring our deepest questions to the Lord, trusting that His righteousness will prevail even when His purposes remain hidden.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress?</span> Job assumes that he is oppressed. He has no conception that his sufferings are a purification (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>), intended to lead to the elevation and improvement of his moral character. He therefore asks - Is it worthy of God, is it good in him, is it compatible with his perfect excellence, to be an oppressor? It is a sort of <span class="accented">argumentum ad verecundiam</span> well enough between man and man, but quite out of place between a man and his Maker. <span class="cmt_word">That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>). This argument is more legitimate. God may be expected, not to despise, but to care for, the work of his own hands (comp. <a href="/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; 64:21; Isaiah 64:8; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). Every maker of a thing, as Aristotle says, loves his work, and naturally guards it, cares for it, and cherishes it<span class="cmt_word">. And shine upon the counsel of the wicked</span> (comp. <a href="/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>). The prosperity of evil-doers must arise, Job thinks, from God allowing his countenance to shine upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Does it please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1496;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
