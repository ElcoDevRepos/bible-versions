In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends, asserting that God's power and wisdom are evident in the natural world. The imagery of being "in His hand" suggests protection, authority, and intimate involvement. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>, which states, "In His hand are the depths of the earth." The idea that life is sustained by God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting His role as the Creator and Sustainer. This phrase also reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine kingship, where a king's hand symbolized power and control.<p><b>as well as the breath of all mankind</b><br>The "breath" here refers to the life force or spirit that God imparts to humans, a concept rooted in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. This underscores the belief that human life is a divine gift, dependent on God's will. The Hebrew word for breath, "ruach," can also mean spirit, indicating a deeper spiritual dimension. This phrase connects to <a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>, where Paul speaks of God giving "life and breath and everything else" to humanity. It serves as a reminder of human dependence on God for existence and sustenance, reinforcing the idea that life is not self-sustaining but reliant on divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
