In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is addressing Job's complaints about God's justice. The concept of God's anger is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with divine judgment and righteousness (e.g., <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). God's anger is not like human anger; it is a response to sin and injustice, reflecting His holiness and justice.<p><b>He has not punished</b><br>Elihu is pointing out that God has not yet executed judgment or punishment on Job, despite Job's complaints and perceived self-righteousness. This reflects the biblical principle that God's patience and mercy often delay immediate judgment, allowing time for repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). The idea of divine forbearance is seen throughout Scripture, where God withholds immediate punishment to give people the opportunity to turn back to Him.<p><b>or taken much notice of folly!</b><br>The term "folly" in biblical literature often refers to moral and spiritual foolishness, not merely intellectual error. Elihu suggests that God has not fully addressed or responded to what he perceives as Job's foolishness in questioning God's justice. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The patience of God in not immediately addressing folly can be seen as an aspect of His grace, allowing individuals the chance to gain wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The Authorised Version refers the first clause to God and the second to Job. Perhaps we may render, <span class= "ital">But now, what His anger has visited upon thee is as nothing </span>(compared with thy deserts); <span class= "ital">yea, He hath not regarded the great abundance </span>(of thy sin), <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, hath not visited it with anger. <span class= "ital">Therefore doth Job, </span>&c.

The word thus rendered <span class= "ital">arrogance </span>is not found elsewhere; it appears to mean abundance or superfluity. Of these renderings, the first seems to give the better sense. The general bearing of the verse is perhaps apparent however rendered, namely, that Job is encouraged in his murmurings, because God hath dealt too leniently with him. Elihu's reproaches must have been some of the heaviest that Job had to bear. Happily the judgment was not to be long deferred. (See <a href="/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - Leaving his advice to sink into Job's mind, Elihu turns from him to the bystanders, and remarks, with some severity, that it is because Job has not been punished enough, because God has not visited him for his petulance and arrogance, that he indulges in "high swelling words of vanity," and continues to utter words which are foolish and" without knowledge." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger</span>.

(So Schultens, Canon Cook, and, with a slight difference, our Revisers.) God had not visited Job with any fresh afflictions on account of his vehement expostulations and overbold and reckless words. Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity. The Authorized Version again wholly misses the meaning.
