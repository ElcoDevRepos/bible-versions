In the context of Job, it challenges the assumption that wealth and success are direct indicators of righteousness. This idea is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states that while humans plan their course, the Lord establishes their steps. Theologically, this underscores the sovereignty of God over human affairs, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures often attributed prosperity to divine favor, yet Job's assertion here questions the simplistic equation of wealth with divine approval.<p><b>so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked</b><br>Job distances himself from the advice and lifestyle of the wicked, emphasizing his commitment to righteousness despite his suffering. This reflects <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which blesses those who do not walk in the counsel of the wicked. The cultural context of the time often saw the wicked as those who defied God's laws and pursued selfish gain. Job's stance is a declaration of his integrity and faithfulness to God, even when the prosperity of the wicked seems to contradict divine justice. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, which warns that bad company corrupts good character, highlighting the importance of aligning oneself with godly counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

God's providence is, at least, one element in it, since he exalts men and abases them, he casteth down and lifteth up. Hence it would seem to follow that they are his favourites. Shall Job therefore cast in his lot with them? No, he says, a thousand times, No! <span class="cmt_word">The counsel of the wicked is far from me</span>; or better, <span class="accented">be the counsel of the wicked far from me!</span> I will have nothing to do with it. I will cling to God. I will maintain my integrity. Satan had charged Job with serving God for the sake of temporal reward. Job had disproved the charge by still clinging to God, notwithstanding all his afflictions. Now he goes further, and declines to throw in his lot with the wicked, even although it should appear that the balance of prosperity is with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
