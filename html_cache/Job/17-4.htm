This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God hardening hearts, as seen in <a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a> with Pharaoh. Theologically, it raises questions about human free will and divine intervention. The closing of minds can be seen as a form of judgment, where God allows individuals to persist in their ignorance due to their own stubbornness, similar to <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, where God gives people over to a depraved mind.<p><b>therefore You will not exalt them.</b><br>The lack of exaltation implies a withholding of honor or blessing, which in the ancient Near Eastern context, was often seen as a sign of divine favor. Job's friends, who have failed to understand his plight, will not receive God's favor or elevation. This can be connected to the biblical principle that understanding and wisdom are prerequisites for honor, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>. Theologically, it underscores the idea that true exaltation comes from God alone, as echoed in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, where humility before God leads to exaltation. This also foreshadows the ultimate exaltation of Christ, who, despite being misunderstood and rejected, was exalted by God (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Verse 4 captures the cry of a wounded servant who still knows that God rules every heart. Job&#8217;s statement is not a boast of superiority but a lament that the very people meant to console him are spiritually blocked from seeing the truth.<p>Cross references within this backdrop:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things from Your law.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;Ears that hear and eyes that see&#8212;the LORD has made them both.&#8221; These verses highlight that understanding is always a gift from God, not a human achievement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>closed minds to understanding</b><p>&#8220;You have closed their minds to understanding&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job recognizes God&#8217;s sovereignty over the human mind, echoing <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a> where God tells Moses He makes the mute and the deaf.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> paints the sober picture of hearts that become dull; Job applies that truth to his friends.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a> show that when people resist truth, God may hand them over to their own blindness.
