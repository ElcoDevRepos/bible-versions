The "foundations of the earth" metaphorically refer to the creation of the world, emphasizing God's role as the Creator. This echoes <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is depicted as the initiator of creation. The imagery of laying foundations suggests stability and order, contrasting with the chaos Job perceives in his life. This question challenges Job's limited perspective and reminds readers of the divine sovereignty and omnipotence. The rhetorical nature of the question underscores human limitations in comprehending the full scope of God's creation.<p><b>Tell Me, if you have understanding.</b><br>This phrase invites Job to reflect on his own knowledge and understanding, which is limited compared to God's infinite wisdom. The challenge to "tell Me" is not just for Job but for all humanity, highlighting the gap between human and divine knowledge. The concept of "understanding" here is linked to wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>, which attributes the creation of the world to God's wisdom. This serves as a reminder of the need for humility before God. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), pointing to the ultimate source of understanding and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Before Job existed, God already was (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>).<p>&#8211; The personal &#8220;you&#8221; highlights that Job&#8217;s vantage point is strictly human and time-bound. Job&#8217;s suffering had led him to question God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35-37</a>), but God reminds him that any evaluation of His ways must start with humble recognition of creaturely finitude.<p>&#8211; This short phrase invites us to pause and confess our absence from the dawn of creation, much like the psalmist who declares, &#8220;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I laid the foundations of the earth?</b><p>&#8211; God describes creation in architectural language, portraying Himself as the master builder who set the earth&#8217;s footings (<a href="/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a>).<p>&#8211; These words affirm a literal, historical act: the earth did not arise by chance but by deliberate divine workmanship on specific days (<a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>).<p>&#8211; By recalling this foundational work, the LORD underscores His absolute authority over nature, history, and, by extension, Job&#8217;s personal circumstances (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell Me,</b><p>&#8211; Far from seeking information, God invites Job to speak if he can&#8212;an invitation that immediately exposes Job&#8217;s inability (<a href="/job/40-3.htm">Job 40:3-5</a>).<p>&#8211; This rhetorical summons mirrors God&#8217;s questions to Adam, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>), drawing out confession rather than data.<p>&#8211; The point is relational: God engages Job directly, demonstrating that true wisdom starts with reverent dialogue, not human assertion (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you have understanding.</b><p>&#8211; God sets the bar at divine-level insight, which no human possesses on his own (<a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-34</a>).<p>&#8211; The clause dismantles any notion that human logic or experience can fully grasp the Creator&#8217;s purposes. Job had defended his integrity, yet integrity alone cannot unlock the mysteries of God&#8217;s governance.<p>&#8211; Ultimately, this phrase drives Job&#8212;and all readers&#8212;to trust the LORD&#8217;s revealed word rather than demand explanations beyond our reach (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a> redirects suffering hearts away from self-justification toward worship. By reminding Job of his absence at creation, God reveals the vast gap between the human and the divine. Only the One who laid earth&#8217;s foundations possesses the wisdom to govern it; therefore, we rest in His perfect knowledge, confident that the Creator who began all things also oversees every detail of our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Where wast thou?</span>--The comparison of the creation of the world to the building of an edifice is such a concession to the feebleness of man as serves of itself to heighten the effect of the inevitable answer to the question preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?</span> Wast thou present?
