In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends, asserting that true understanding and might are found in God alone. This echoes the biblical theme that God is the source of all wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, "For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding." The power of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>, "Power belongs to God." This statement also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ, who is described as the wisdom and power of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. The acknowledgment of God's ultimate authority serves as a reminder of human limitations and the need for humility before Him.<p><b>The deceived and the deceiver are His.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty over all creation, including those who are misled and those who mislead others. It suggests that nothing is outside of God's control, even the actions of those who deceive. This can be connected to the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph tells his brothers, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good." It underscores the belief that God can use even the actions of deceivers to fulfill His purposes. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of God's providence, where He governs all events in the universe. It also points to the ultimate accountability of all individuals to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, "So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God." This phrase reassures believers that God is in control, even in situations involving deception and falsehood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
