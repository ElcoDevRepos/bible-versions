Anger in biblical terms often indicates a deep sense of injustice or moral outrage. Elihu, a younger man, is frustrated with the older friends of Job, which reflects the cultural expectation of wisdom and understanding being associated with age. This anger also sets the stage for Elihu's speeches, which aim to address what he perceives as the failures of the friends and Job. The friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, represent traditional wisdom, which Elihu finds lacking.<p><b>because they had failed to refute Job</b><br>The friends' inability to refute Job's arguments is crucial. Throughout the dialogues, Job maintains his innocence and questions the simplistic retribution theology that the friends espouse. Their failure to provide a satisfactory answer to Job's suffering challenges the prevailing understanding of divine justice. This reflects a broader biblical theme where human wisdom is often shown to be inadequate in comprehending God's ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human understanding.<p><b>and yet had condemned him</b><br>The condemnation of Job by his friends, despite their inability to prove him wrong, underscores the theme of unjust judgment. This reflects a common biblical motif where the righteous suffer unjustly, as seen in the experiences of figures like Joseph and David. The friends' condemnation without evidence also prefigures the wrongful accusations faced by Jesus Christ, who, despite being sinless, was condemned by the religious leaders of His time. This phrase highlights the danger of relying on human judgment without divine insight, a lesson echoed in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-2</a>, where Jesus warns against judging others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who becomes angry with Job's three friends for their inability to provide a satisfactory answer to Job's suffering and for unjustly condemning him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man who suffers immense trials and questions God's justice, yet remains faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_three_friends.htm">Job's Three Friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar)</a></b><br>They attempt to explain Job's suffering through traditional wisdom, suggesting it is due to sin, but fail to provide true comfort or understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dialogue.htm">The Dialogue</a></b><br>The ongoing conversation between Job and his friends, which Elihu interrupts to offer his perspective.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_righteous_judgment.htm">The Importance of Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>Elihu's anger reflects a desire for justice and truth.
