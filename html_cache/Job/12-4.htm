In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, friendship was a sacred bond, and being mocked by friends was a profound dishonor. This reflects Job's social downfall, as he was once a respected figure (<a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7-11</a>). The term "laughingstock" indicates ridicule and scorn, which is a common theme in the Psalms where the righteous suffer unjustly (<a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>).<p><b>though I called on God, and He answered</b><br>Job recalls his past relationship with God, emphasizing his faithfulness and the divine response he once experienced. This phrase highlights the tension between Job's current suffering and his previous experiences of God's favor. It echoes the biblical principle that God hears the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>), yet Job's current plight seems to contradict this, creating a theological dilemma.<p><b>The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock</b><br>This statement underscores the paradox of the righteous suffering while the wicked prosper, a recurring theme in wisdom literature (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>). It challenges the retributive justice theology held by Job's friends, who believe suffering is always a result of sin. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ, the ultimate righteous sufferer, who was mocked and scorned despite His innocence (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He is not using hyperbole; the three companions who should have comforted him have instead mocked and judged him (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Suffering often isolates; even those closest may misread a trial as divine disfavor, as David experienced when his acquaintances &#8220;fled from me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Ridicule hurts most when it comes from friends, foreshadowing Christ, who &#8220;was despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>) and surrounded by mockers at the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently acknowledges that godly people can be misunderstood (<a href="/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7&#8211;9</a>), encouraging believers to expect, yet not internalize, such scorn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though I called on God, and He answered</b><p>Job reminds them&#8212;and himself&#8212;that he has a history of real communion with God.<p>&#8226; Earlier blessings (<a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>) and answered prayers (<a href="/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1&#8211;3</a>) prove Job&#8217;s relationship was genuine. His present silence from heaven is a testing season, not evidence of hypocrisy.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s responsiveness to the righteous is affirmed elsewhere: &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>) and &#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Job models perseverance in prayer. Like Habakkuk, he keeps bringing his case before God, confident of eventual reply (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between divine approval and human contempt highlights a timeless truth: God&#8217;s verdict outranks people&#8217;s opinions (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock</b><p>Job widens the statement from his personal experience to a pattern: righteousness itself invites mockery.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a> notes that &#8220;he who is upright in the way is loathsome to the wicked.&#8221; Moral clarity irritates those comfortable with compromise (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophets were jeered (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>), and faithful believers are promised the same: &#8220;All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter encourages sufferers, &#8220;If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>), turning scorn into a badge of honor.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s declaration foreshadows the righteous One&#8212;Jesus&#8212;who was clothed in perfect uprightness yet mocked, proving that human derision is no measure of divine approval (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a> lays bare the painful irony that a believer can enjoy answered prayer and still become the butt of jokes. Friends may misinterpret trials as judgment, but God&#8217;s prior faithfulness stands as evidence of the believer&#8217;s integrity. Scripture shows this tension is normal: the world often ridicules the righteous. Job&#8217;s words encourage us to anchor our identity in God&#8217;s response, not in human reactions, and to remain steadfast, knowing that divine vindication will silence every scoffer in God&#8217;s time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">I am as one mocked of his neighbour.</span>--The laughing-stock of his companion--he who called on God, and He answered him. This is either the character Job claims for himself, or it is the supposed taunt of his friends--the righteous and the perfect a laughing-stock, or, the righteous and the perfect might be a laughing-stock. Ridicule is no test of truth or of merit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am as one mocked of his neighbour</span>.
