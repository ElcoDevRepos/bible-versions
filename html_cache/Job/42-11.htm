In ancient Near Eastern culture, family and community were central to one's identity and support system. The return of Job's family and friends signifies a restoration of his honor and status. This gathering for a meal is significant, as sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and reconciliation. The communal meal can be seen as a precursor to the communal aspects of the Lord's Supper in the New Testament, symbolizing unity and restoration.<p><b>They consoled him and comforted him over all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him.</b><br>The act of consoling and comforting Job reflects the biblical principle of mourning with those who mourn (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). It acknowledges the sovereignty of God in Job's trials, as the text attributes the adversity to the LORD. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over both prosperity and suffering (<a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The friends' actions contrast with their earlier accusations, showing a shift from judgment to empathy. This change can be seen as a type of repentance, paralleling the New Testament call to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>And each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</b><br>The giving of silver and gold rings is a tangible expression of support and restoration. In the ancient world, such gifts were symbols of wealth and honor. This act can be seen as a reversal of Job's earlier loss and a sign of God's blessing and restoration, reminiscent of the wealth given to the Israelites as they left Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>). The gifts also symbolize the restoration of Job's fortunes, prefiguring the ultimate restoration and reward of the faithful in the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God wipes away every tear and restores all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.

Job, like other wealthy and prosperous men had during the time of his prosperity had "troops of friends" (see <a href="/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8-10, 21-25</a>). When adversity swooped down they fell away. Now they had the effrontery to claim his acquaintance once more, and to come and be his guests; they did eat bread with him in his house. Nay, more, they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him, whereof the worst part was their own coldness and desertion (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14, 19</a>). Finally, to establish the renewed friendship, every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold. The money given is said to have been a <span class="accented">kesitah</span> which means probably a certain weight of silver, though whether a shekel or not is uncertain. The word belongs to the earlier Hebrew, being found only in <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, and in the present passage. Ear-rings were commonly worn in the East by men as well as women, as appears from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/42-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his brothers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1448;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
