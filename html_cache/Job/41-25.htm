In ancient Near Eastern mythology, similar creatures represented forces of chaos subdued by gods. Biblically, Leviathan is mentioned in other passages such as <a href="/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where it is depicted as a creature defeated by God, symbolizing God's power over chaos. The rising of Leviathan here suggests an overwhelming and fearsome presence, emphasizing the creature's formidable nature.<p><b>the mighty are terrified</b><br>The "mighty" refers to those who are powerful or strong, possibly warriors or leaders. Their fear in the presence of Leviathan highlights the creature's immense power and the futility of human strength against it. This can be seen as a metaphor for human limitations in the face of divine or natural forces. The terror of the mighty underscores the theme of humility before God's creation, as seen in other biblical narratives where human pride is brought low.<p><b>they withdraw before his thrashing</b><br>The image of withdrawal suggests a retreat or surrender, indicating that even the strongest are powerless against Leviathan's thrashing. This thrashing can be seen as a representation of chaos and destruction, further emphasizing the creature's uncontrollable nature. The idea of retreating before such power can be connected to the broader biblical theme of recognizing human limitations and the need for reliance on God. This phrase also echoes the futility of opposing God's will, as seen in other scriptures where human efforts are thwarted by divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Egyptian historians said that one of their early kings had been slain by a crocodile (Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 1:20, p. 98). The worship paid to crocodiles in some parts of Egypt, and the hatred felt towards them in others, were probably alike inspired by fear. AElian says that, in the districts where crocodiles were worshipped, it was not safe for any one to wash his feet or to draw water at the river, and that in the vicinity of some towns people did not dare to walk along the bank of the stream ('Nat. An.,' 10:24). In modern times they have been known to precipitate men from the bank into the water by a sweep of their tail, and then to devour them at their leisure. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of breakings they purify themselves</span>;
