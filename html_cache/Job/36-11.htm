In the context of Job, Elihu is speaking about the consequences of human actions in relation to divine justice. Obedience to God is a central tenet in the Old Testament, seen in the covenant relationship between God and Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-15</a>). Serving God is also highlighted in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of serving God rather than wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). The call to obedience and service is a call to align one's life with God's will, reflecting a heart transformed by faith.<p><b>then they end their days in prosperity</b><br>Prosperity in the biblical sense often refers to more than just material wealth; it includes spiritual well-being and peace. In the historical context of Job, prosperity was seen as a sign of God's favor. This aligns with the wisdom literature's general principle that righteousness leads to blessing (<a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>). However, the book of Job challenges the simplistic equation of righteousness with prosperity, as Job's suffering occurs despite his righteousness. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate prosperity found in eternal life through Christ, who offers spiritual riches beyond earthly wealth (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p><b>and their years in happiness</b><br>Happiness, or joy, in the biblical context is often linked to a right relationship with God. The Hebrew concept of "shalom" encompasses peace, completeness, and contentment, which are aspects of true happiness. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, long life and happiness were seen as blessings from God (<a href="/psalms/128.htm">Psalm 128:1-2</a>). The New Testament expands on this by teaching that true joy is found in Christ, regardless of circumstances (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). This phrase points to the ultimate fulfillment of joy in the presence of God, as seen in the promise of eternal life with Him (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
