In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is addressing Job's complaints about God's justice. Elihu argues that if God is just and powerful, how much less should Job expect to understand His ways fully. This reflects the theme of human limitation in understanding divine purposes, a recurring theme in wisdom literature.<p><b>when you say that you do not see Him,</b><br>Job has expressed his frustration at not being able to perceive God's presence or understand His actions. This reflects a common human experience of feeling distant from God, especially in times of suffering. Biblically, this echoes the sentiments found in Psalms, where the psalmists often cry out for God's presence (e.g., <a href="/psalms/10.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>). Theologically, it underscores the concept of faith, which is belief in what is not seen (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><b>that your case is before Him</b><br>Elihu reminds Job that his situation is known to God, even if Job cannot perceive it. This phrase suggests the idea of divine omniscience and justice, where God is aware of all human affairs. It aligns with the biblical teaching that God is a righteous judge (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>) and that nothing is hidden from His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>and you must wait for Him,</b><br>Patience and waiting on God are central themes in the Bible. This phrase encourages trust in God's timing and sovereignty. It resonates with other scriptures that emphasize waiting on the Lord, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, which promises renewed strength to those who wait on God. This waiting is not passive but involves active faith and trust in God's ultimate justice and goodness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
