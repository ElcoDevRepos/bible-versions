In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is advising Job to make peace with God, implying that Job's suffering is due to a lack of reconciliation. The concept of reconciliation is central to the biblical narrative, where humanity is called to restore a broken relationship with God due to sin. This aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>, where believers are urged to be reconciled to God through Christ. The idea of peace with God is also echoed in <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>, which speaks of being justified by faith and having peace with God through Jesus Christ. Historically, reconciliation involved sacrifices and offerings, but in the New Testament, it is achieved through the sacrifice of Jesus, the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>thereby good will come to you.</b><br>This phrase suggests that reconciliation with God results in blessings and prosperity. In the cultural and historical context of the Old Testament, prosperity was often seen as a sign of God's favor. The Deuteronomic principle, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, reflecting the belief that good comes to those who align themselves with God's will. However, the Book of Job challenges this simplistic view by presenting a righteous man who suffers. Theologically, this phrase can be understood as pointing to the ultimate good that comes from a restored relationship with God, which is eternal life and spiritual blessings, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. The "good" is not merely material prosperity but encompasses the peace, joy, and fulfillment found in a life aligned with God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>- A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

"Thereby good shall come unto thee," or "Thereby shall thine increase be good;" or perhaps he means that peace and rest from the obstinate questionings he was disturbed with would come to him thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-30.</span> - At this point a transition occurs. Eliphaz turns away from reproaches, open or covert, designed to exhibit Job as an example of extreme wickedness, and falls back on those topics which were the main subjects of his first exhortation (<a href="/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8-27</a>), viz. an earnest appeal to Job to return to God, to repent and amend (vers. 21-23) and a lavish outpouring of promises, or prophecies, that in that case he should be delivered from all his troubles, should recover his wealth and prosperity, obtain of God all that he should pray for, succeed in all his enterprises, and be able to help and ease others, even those who might be guilty in God's sight (vers. 24-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Acquaint now thyself with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; or, make, <span class="accented">I beseech thee</span> <span class="accented">a trial of him</span>, <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> risk everything, throw thyself upon his mercy, and so make thy peace with him. To do so is well worth thy while, for thereby good shall come unto thee. It is a question what sort of "good" is meant. If we are to explain the "good" of this passage by vers. 24, 25 exclusively, Eliphaz will become a mere utilitarian, and he will be rightly characterized as "selfish and sordid" (Cook) - an anticipation of the Mammon of Milton. But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for singling out vers. 24, 25 from the rest of the passage, and regarding them as forming its key-note. The "good" which Eliphaz promises to Job includes, besides "the gold of Ophir" and "plenty of silver," such things as "delight in the Almighty," and confident trust in him (ver. 26), God's hearing of his prayers (ver. 27), the shining of light upon his path (ver. 28), his own payment of his vows (ver. 27), his giving assistance to the poor and needy (ver. 29), and even his deliverance of the guilty by the pureness of his hands (ver. 30); so that other besides material considerations are clearly taken into account, and the worldly prosperity which Eliphaz promises forms a part only of the good result which he anticipates from the patriarch making his peace with the Almighty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Reconcile</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(has&#183;ken-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5532.htm">Strong's 5532: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be familiar with, to minister to, be serviceable to, be customary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and be at peace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1501;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;lm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
