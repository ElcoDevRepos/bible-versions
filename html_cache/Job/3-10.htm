In the context of Job's lament, he curses the day of his birth and the night of his conception, wishing it had never occurred. This reflects the depth of his despair. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the night was often associated with mystery and the unknown, which aligns with Job's desire for that night to be erased from existence.<p><b>did not shut the doors of the womb</b><br>The imagery of "shutting the doors of the womb" suggests preventing birth. In biblical times, the womb was often seen as a sacred space, and the opening of the womb was a divine act. This phrase indicates Job's wish that he had never been born, highlighting his intense suffering. The concept of God opening and closing the womb is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>, where God controls fertility.<p><b>to hide the sorrow from my eyes</b><br>Job desires that the sorrow he is experiencing would have been hidden from him by never being born. This reflects the human struggle with suffering and the desire to escape it. The theme of sorrow and suffering is central to the Book of Job, as Job grapples with the reasons for his intense pain. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God being aware of human suffering, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>, where God is said to collect tears in a bottle, indicating His awareness and care for human sorrow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He looks back to the very night of his conception and laments that it was allowed at all. Because the womb opened, he now sees sorrow; had it remained shut, his eyes would never have beheld such grief. Job&#8217;s words do not deny God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;quite the opposite. They show a man so convinced of God&#8217;s control that he wishes the Lord had intervened earlier to spare him pain. In raw honesty, Job voices what many feel in deep affliction, yet even this cry is directed toward the God who alone opens and closes the womb and ultimately brings redemption out of sorrow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of my womb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of the womb which bare me."
