It echoes <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, where David similarly questions the significance of man in the vastness of creation. The rhetorical question emphasizes the smallness of human beings in the grand scheme of God's creation, highlighting the theme of human frailty and dependence on God.<p><b>that You should exalt him</b><br>The idea of God exalting man suggests a divine favor and grace that is not based on human merit. This can be seen as a reflection of the biblical theme of God's grace, where He chooses to lift up the humble and lowly (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). It also points to the special place humanity holds in creation, being made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), and the potential for redemption and exaltation through Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>that You should set Your heart upon him</b><br>This phrase indicates God's deep care and attention towards humanity. It suggests a personal and intimate relationship between God and man, where God is not distant or indifferent but actively involved in human affairs. This is consistent with the biblical narrative of God's covenant relationship with His people, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the nation of Israel. It also foreshadows the ultimate expression of God's love and commitment in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who came to dwell among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and to offer salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

It seems, at first sight, an exalted idea of God to regard him as too lofty, too great, to be really concerned about so mean a creature, so poor a being, as man. Hence, among the Greeks, the Epicureans maintained that God paid no attention at all to this world, or to anything that happened in it, but dwelt secure and tranquil in the empyrean, with nothing to disturb, displease, or vex him. And the holy men of old sometimes fell into this same phase of thought, and expressed surprise and wonder that God, who dwelt on high, should "humble himself to consider the things in heaven and earth." "Lord," says David, or whoever was the author of the hundred and forty-fourth psalm, "what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man k like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away" (<a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3, 4</a>). But all, except Epicureans, agree that God does, in fact, so concern himself, and a little reflection is enough to show us that the opposite view, instead of exalting, really degrades God. To bring conscious, sentient beings into the world - beings capable of the intensest happiness or misery, and then to leave them wholly to themselves, to have no further care or thought of them, would be the part, not of a grand, glorious, and adorable Being, but of one destitute of any claim to our admiration. <span class="cmt_word">And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</span> This strong expression is not used of God elsewhere. But it well expresses the <span class="accented">extreme</span> tenderness and consideration that God has for man, and the deep love from which that tenderness and consideration spring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1453;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_582.htm">Strong's 582: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You should exalt him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7713;ad&#183;d&#601;&#183;len&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124;
