The wilderness, often depicted in Scripture as a place of desolation and testing, is here shown as a divinely appointed home. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and order in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God assigns specific roles and places to all creatures. The wilderness also serves as a backdrop for significant biblical events, such as the Israelites' journey in Exodus and Jesus' temptation in the Gospels, symbolizing both trial and divine presence.<p><b>and the salt flats his dwelling</b><br>Salt flats, or salt lands, are areas characterized by high salinity and minimal vegetation, often inhospitable to human life. In the ancient Near East, such regions were considered barren and unproductive, yet God assigns them as the dwelling place for the wild donkey. This underscores the theme of divine wisdom and purpose in creation, where even seemingly desolate places have their role and inhabitants. The mention of salt flats can also evoke the imagery of judgment and purification, as seen in the story of Lot's wife in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> and the use of salt in sacrifices in Leviticus. This phrase emphasizes God's control over all aspects of the natural world, providing for creatures in environments that humans might overlook or deem worthless.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, highlighting His sovereignty and wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>A desolate and uninhabited region, often symbolizing a place of testing or divine encounter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt_flats.htm">Salt Flats</a></b><br>Barren areas with high salt content, representing inhospitable and challenging environments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wild_donkey.htm">Wild Donkey</a></b><br>An animal mentioned in the context of God's creation, symbolizing freedom and independence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>God has the authority to assign each creature its habitat, demonstrating His control over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_in_desolation.htm">Purpose in Desolation</a></b><br>Even in barren places like the wilderness and salt flats, God has a purpose, reminding us that He can use desolate times for growth and learning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_god's_design.htm">Freedom in God's Design</a></b><br>The wild donkey's life in the wilderness symbolizes the freedom God grants within His creation, encouraging us to trust in His provision and design.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god's_wisdom.htm">Trusting God's Wisdom</a></b><br>Just as God provides for the wild donkey, we can trust Him to care for us, even in difficult and barren seasons of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/embracing_god's_plan.htm">Embracing God's Plan</a></b><br>Understanding that God has a plan for every aspect of creation encourages us to embrace His will, even when it leads us into challenging environments.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_39_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 39:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_6_God_s_care_in_desolation.htm">How does Job 39:6 illustrate God's provision in seemingly barren places?

The same Creator who declared, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>) is reminding Job that His hand fashioned every corner of the world, including the least hospitable places.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> confirms, &#8220;For in Him all things were created&#8230; all things have been created through Him and for Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s creative initiative extends not only to beautiful gardens but also to harsh landscapes. <a href="/psalms/95-5.htm">Psalm 95:5</a> echoes, &#8220;The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.&#8221; God alone determines where every creature belongs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;wilderness&#8221; evokes images of untamed, lonely expanses. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a> describes a &#8220;desert land, a barren, howling wasteland,&#8221; yet God still watches over it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4</a> notes people wandering &#8220;in desert wastelands,&#8221; highlighting its emptiness. God fashions even these remote regions, displaying power unconfined by human civilization.<p>&#8226; By referencing the wilderness, the Lord underscores that He rules places Job cannot reach or manage&#8212;an answer to Job&#8217;s implied doubts about divine oversight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his home</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;His&#8221; refers to the wild donkey introduced in <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>.

Job may own flocks, but only God allocates territory for beasts beyond human control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the salt flats</b><p>&#8226; Salt flats (or salt land) are even more inhospitable than typical deserts. <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> pictures one dwelling &#8220;in parched places of the wilderness, in a salt land where no one lives.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> describes cursed terrain &#8220;like Sodom and Gomorrah, which the LORD overthrew&#8230; a land of salt and burning sulfur.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By selecting such an extreme environment, God highlights His ability to sustain life in conditions we deem impossible, underscoring that limits we see are not limits to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his dwelling</b><p>&#8226; God not only places the wild donkey in the salt flats; He calls it that animal&#8217;s &#8220;dwelling.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-11</a> reminds us, &#8220;Every beast of the forest is Mine&#8230; I know every bird of the mountains.&#8221; Nothing lives outside God&#8217;s purview.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a> asks, &#8220;Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?&#8221;&#8212;a parallel to this verse, stressing divine care in unlikely settings.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s declaration confronts Job with the truth that creatures flourish apart from human intervention, proving God&#8217;s ceaseless governance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/39-6.htm">Job 39:6</a> communicates God&#8217;s sovereignty, creativity, and caretaking in realms beyond human reach. By crafting the wild donkey&#8217;s life in barren deserts and salty wastelands, the Lord demonstrates that He not only made every environment but also purposefully assigns each creature a fitting home. The verse reassures us that God&#8217;s wise, sustaining hand operates even where human eyes seldom see, inviting confidence in His comprehensive rule over all creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose house I have made the wilderness</span>.
