In the ancient Near Eastern context, elders and leaders were often sought for their wisdom and guidance. Job's words carried weight, indicating his role as a wise and respected figure. This respect is reminiscent of the authority given to leaders like Moses, whose words were also heeded by the people (<a href="/exodus/18-24.htm">Exodus 18:24</a>). The silence following Job's words suggests a deep reverence and acknowledgment of his wisdom, similar to how the people responded to Solomon's judgments (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>).<p><b>my speech settled on them like dew.</b><br>Dew in the biblical context often symbolizes blessing and refreshment (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>). Job's speech being compared to dew suggests that his words were not only authoritative but also life-giving and refreshing to those who heard them. This imagery can be connected to the teachings of Jesus, whose words were described as spirit and life (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). The metaphor of dew also implies a gentle and pervasive influence, indicating that Job's wisdom was absorbed and appreciated by his listeners, much like how dew nourishes the earth quietly and effectively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
