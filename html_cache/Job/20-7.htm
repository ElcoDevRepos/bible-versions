In the context of the Book of Job, Zophar is speaking about the fate of the wicked, suggesting that their end is absolute and irreversible. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where the wicked ultimately face eternal consequences for their actions. The idea of perishing forever is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, which speaks of the wicked perishing like smoke. This phrase underscores the belief in a moral order governed by God, where evil does not ultimately triumph.<p><b>like his own dung</b><br>The comparison to dung is a vivid metaphor illustrating the contempt and worthlessness associated with the wicked after their demise. In ancient Near Eastern culture, dung was considered unclean and was often used as a symbol of disgrace and rejection. This imagery is intended to convey the idea that the wicked, once powerful and influential, will be reduced to something despised and forgotten. The use of such a strong metaphor highlights the dramatic reversal of fortunes that the wicked will experience, aligning with the biblical principle that pride leads to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>those who had seen him will ask, &#8216;Where is he?&#8217;</b><br>This phrase suggests the sudden and complete disappearance of the wicked from the community. It implies that those who once knew or feared the wicked will be astonished at their absence, unable to comprehend how someone so prominent could vanish so entirely. This reflects the transient nature of earthly power and success, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>, where the wicked are described as being gone and untraceable. The rhetorical question "Where is he?" underscores the futility of relying on worldly status and serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
