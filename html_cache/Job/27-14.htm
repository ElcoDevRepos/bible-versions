Sons were seen as carriers of the family name and protectors of the family estate. This phrase suggests a contrast between the apparent blessing of numerous offspring and the impending judgment that will befall them. The idea of many sons can be linked to the promises given to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, who was promised descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). However, the context here is one of impending doom rather than blessing.<p><b>They are destined for the sword</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol for war, judgment, and death. This phrase indicates that despite the number of sons, they will face violence and destruction. This can be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, where the wicked, despite their apparent prosperity, ultimately face God's judgment. The imagery of the sword is prevalent throughout the Bible, often associated with God's judgment (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). It serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly power and the ultimate sovereignty of God.<p><b>And his offspring will never have enough food</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of scarcity and famine, which were common fears in the ancient world. Food scarcity was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment. In the broader biblical narrative, famine is used as a tool of God's judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>). The lack of food for the offspring underscores the futility of relying on earthly wealth and prosperity, as these can be easily stripped away. It also serves as a reminder of the dependence on God for sustenance, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
