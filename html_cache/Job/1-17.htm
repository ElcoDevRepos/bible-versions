It underscores the theme of sudden and relentless suffering, a key element in the narrative of Job's testing. This immediacy serves to heighten the dramatic tension and illustrates the depth of Job's faith being tested.<p><b>another messenger came and reported</b><br>The arrival of another messenger signifies the continuation of Job's trials. In the ancient Near Eastern context, messengers were crucial for communication, especially in times of crisis. This reflects the historical reliance on oral communication and the role of messengers in conveying urgent news.<p><b>The Chaldeans formed three bands</b><br>The Chaldeans were a nomadic tribe known for their military prowess and later became a dominant force in Babylon. Their mention here indicates a historical context where such raids were common. The formation of "three bands" suggests a strategic and organized attack, highlighting the calculated nature of the assault on Job's possessions.<p><b>raided the camels, and took them away</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in the ancient world, used for transportation and trade. The loss of camels would have been a significant economic blow to Job, symbolizing the stripping away of his wealth and status. This act of raiding reflects the historical reality of tribal conflicts and the vulnerability of wealth in livestock.<p><b>They put the servants to the sword</b><br>This phrase indicates the violence and brutality of the attack. The killing of servants not only represents a personal loss for Job but also a disruption of his household and livelihood. It reflects the harsh realities of life in the ancient Near East, where such violence was not uncommon.<p><b>and I alone have escaped to tell you!</b><br>The survival of a single messenger serves as a narrative device to ensure Job receives the full account of his losses. This phrase emphasizes the isolation and despair Job faces, as he is left to grapple with the magnitude of his suffering. It also foreshadows the role of a remnant, a theme seen throughout Scripture, where a small group or individual survives to bear witness or continue a legacy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, known for his faithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A group of people from southern Babylonia, known for their skills in warfare and astrology.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/camels.htm">Camels</a></b><br>Valuable animals in Job's time, used for transportation and trade, representing a significant part of Job's wealth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Job's employees who were tending to his camels and were killed during the raid.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messenger.htm">Messenger</a></b><br>The sole survivor of the attack, tasked with delivering the devastating news to Job.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_suffering.htm">The Reality of Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering is an inevitable part of life, even for the righteous.

The verse calls believers to hold possessions lightly, trust God amid cascading trials, and remember that every blow is already weighed by the One who ultimately restores.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The Chaldeans.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Chasdim, </span>or descendants of Chesed (<a href="/genesis/22-22.htm" title="And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.">Genesis 22:22</a>; see Note on <a href="/job/1-1.htm" title="There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.">Job 1:1</a>). This name reappears in the classic Carduchia and in the modern Kurdistan, as well as in the more familiar Chaldaea; it being a well-known philological law that <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">l </span>and <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">s</span> are interchangeable. It is to be noted that this calamity arose from the opposite quarter to the last, illustrating the well-known fact that troubles never come alone, and that causes of a widely different nature seem to combine to overthrow the falling man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he was yet speaking, there came also another</span> (see the comment on ver. 16). The exact repetition of a clause, without the alteration of a word or a letter, is very archaic (comp. <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31</a>; and for another repetition, <a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And said, The Chaldeans</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Casdim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which is the word uniformly used in the Hebrew where the Authorized Version has "Chaldeans" or "Chaldees." The native name seems to have been <span class="accented">Kaldi</span> or <span class="accented">Kaldai</span>, whence the Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">Chaldaei.</span> It is very difficult to account for the Hebrews having substituted a sibilant for the liquid; but it was certainly done from the earliest period of their literature (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>) to the latest (see Targums, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Some derive the Hebrew <span class="accented">Casdim</span> from "Chesed," one of the sons of Nahor (<a href="/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22</a>); but Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees before Chesed was born (<a href="/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>). And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, &sect; 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20). From a remote date they were a settled and civilized people; but no doubt originally they had the same predatory instincts as their neighbours<span class="cmt_word">. Made out three bands</span>. Professor Lee translates, "appointed three captains," which is a possible meaning of the words; but the weight of authority supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">And fell upon the camels</span>. Perhaps the most valuable part of Job's possessions. Three thousand camels would be regarded as a splendid capture by any body of Oriental marauders. <span class="cmt_word">And have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants</span> (literally, the <span class="accented">young men</span>, as in ver. 16) <span class="cmt_word">with the edge of the sword;
