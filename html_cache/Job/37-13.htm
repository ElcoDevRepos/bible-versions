Throughout the Bible, God uses nature to discipline or correct His people, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-11) and the drought during Elijah's time (1 Kings 17). This reflects the belief that God is sovereign over creation and uses it to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>or for His land</b><br>The land is often seen as a gift from God to His people, particularly in the context of Israel. The Promised Land was a central aspect of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). God's care for the land is evident in the laws given to Israel, such as the Sabbatical year (<a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>), which allowed the land to rest. This phrase indicates that God's actions can be for the benefit and sustenance of the land, ensuring its fertility and productivity.<p><b>He accomplishes this</b><br>This emphasizes God's active role in the world. The Bible consistently portrays God as not only the Creator but also the Sustainer of the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). His involvement in the world is purposeful and intentional, aligning with His divine will and plan.<p><b>in His loving devotion</b><br>God's loving devotion, or "chesed" in Hebrew, is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting His steadfast love and mercy. This term is often associated with God's covenantal faithfulness, as seen in His relationship with Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). It underscores that even when God allows or causes difficult circumstances, His actions are rooted in love and a desire for the ultimate good of His people. This reflects the nature of God as described in 1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>, where God is love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Now he reminds Job that the same storm can be a corrective rod.<p>&#8211; Scripture gives many examples:<p>&#8226; When Israel turned to idols, &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anger &#8230; shut the heavens so that there will be no rain&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel called for thunder and rain so the people would &#8220;greatly fear the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah announced drought to expose Ahab&#8217;s sin (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Through Amos God said, &#8220;I withheld the rain &#8230; one field received rain, while another withered&#8221; (<a href="/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7</a>), targeted discipline that could not be dismissed as coincidence.<p>&#8211; The verse teaches that natural events are never random; they can be divine discipline meant to awaken repentance and restore relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or for His land</b><p>&#8211; God also sends the same rain to bless: &#8220;You care for the land and water it; You enrich it abundantly&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>).<p>&#8211; He &#8220;covers the sky with clouds; He prepares rain for the earth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>), ensuring crops, pasture, and life itself.<p>&#8211; Joel celebrated the &#8220;autumn rains&#8221; and the &#8220;former and latter rains&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>) as tokens of covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8211; Jesus pointed to this daily mercy when He said the Father &#8220;sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).<p>&#8211; Elihu&#8217;s contrast shows that every drop has purpose: sometimes corrective, sometimes nurturing, always sovereign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He accomplishes this in His loving devotion</b><p>&#8211; Whether the storm chastens or nourishes, its deeper motive is &#8220;loving devotion&#8221; (&#7717;esed) &#8212; steadfast, covenant love.<p>&#8211; &#8220;Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>) and saturates every act.<p>&#8211; Even lament recognizes, &#8220;Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Discipline flows from a Father&#8217;s heart: &#8220;As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>).<p>&#8211; The same love that withholds rain to correct will pour it out to restore; in both cases He is drawing people to Himself and sustaining the world He made.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-13.htm">Job 37:13</a> teaches that God directs the forces of nature with intentionality.
