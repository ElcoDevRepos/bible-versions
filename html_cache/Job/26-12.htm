The sea, often seen as a symbol of chaos and danger in ancient Near Eastern cultures, is subject to God's command. This echoes the creation narrative where God separates the waters (<a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-10</a>) and demonstrates His authority over nature. The imagery of God stirring the sea can also be connected to the Exodus story, where God parts the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>), showcasing His power to deliver His people. In the New Testament, Jesus calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) serves as a type of Christ, illustrating His divine authority over the natural world.<p><b>by His understanding He shattered Rahab.</b><br>Rahab here is not the individual from the Jericho narrative but a mythological sea monster or symbol of chaos, often associated with Egypt in biblical literature (<a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9-10</a>). This reflects God's wisdom and strategic power in overcoming forces of chaos and opposition. The shattering of Rahab signifies God's victory over evil and disorder, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as He triumphs over the powers of darkness (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). The use of "understanding" emphasizes that God's actions are not arbitrary but are executed with divine wisdom and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his patience and faithfulness amidst suffering.

"Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have "smitten him through <span class="accented">by his understanding</span>" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day.
