It highlights the human tendency to reminisce about better times during periods of suffering. In the context of Job's life, this longing is set against the backdrop of his current afflictions. The "months gone by" refer to a time before Job's trials began, when he was blessed with wealth, family, and health. This sentiment is echoed in other biblical passages where individuals express a desire to return to times of blessing, such as in <a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>, where the psalmist remembers leading the procession to the house of God.<p><b>for the days when God watched over me</b><br>This phrase indicates a period when Job felt the protective presence and favor of God in his life. The concept of God "watching over" someone is a common biblical theme, suggesting divine protection and blessing. In the historical context of the Ancient Near East, divine favor was often associated with prosperity and well-being. Job's lament here is not just about material loss but also about the perceived loss of God's presence and care. This idea is paralleled in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>, where the psalmist speaks of dwelling in the shelter of the Most High and resting in the shadow of the Almighty. Theologically, this phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is described as the Good Shepherd, watching over His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
