This can be seen as a metaphor for the transient nature of human power and ability. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, physical strength was often equated with one's ability to contribute to society and provide for one's family. Job's lament highlights the reversal of fortunes he has experienced, where those who once might have been strong and useful are now of no benefit to him. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the fleeting nature of human strength, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compares human life to grass that flourishes and then withers.<p><b>since their vigor had left them?</b><br>Here, Job emphasizes the loss of vitality and energy in those he once might have relied upon. This reflects the broader theme of human frailty and the inevitable decline that comes with age or misfortune. In the historical context, vigor was not only a physical attribute but also a sign of divine favor and blessing. The loss of vigor could be seen as a withdrawal of God's blessing, a theme that resonates throughout the book of Job as he grapples with understanding his suffering. This phrase also echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1-7</a>, where the Preacher describes the decline of human faculties in old age, underscoring the importance of remembering one's Creator before such days come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

By stressing their worthlessness and exhaustion, Job exposes the depth of his social fall and the empty cruelty of his tormentors. The verse reminds us that human strength unanchored to righteousness is fleeting, but God&#8217;s purposes stand firm, inviting us to ground our confidence not in human ability but in the unwavering power and justice of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, </span>is the description of the fathers; <a href="/job/30-3.htm" title="For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.">Job 30:3</a> <span class= "ital">seqq. </span>describes their children. The people here spoken of seem to have been somewhat similar to those known to the ancients as Troglodytes (Herod. iv. 183, &c.), the inhabitants of caves, who lived an outcast life and had manners and customs of their own. They are desolate with want and famine. They flee into the wilderness on the eve of wasteness and desolation, or when all is dark (yester night), waste, and desolate. It is evident that Job must have been familiar with a people of this kind, an alien and proscribed race living in the way he mentions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yes, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me?</span> Men, who had no such strength in their hands as to yield an employer any profit - poor, weak creatures, <span class="cmt_word">in whom old age</span> (rather, <span class="accented">manly vigour</span>) <span class="cmt_word">was</span> <span class="cmt_word">perished</span>.
