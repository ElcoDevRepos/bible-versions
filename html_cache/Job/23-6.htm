Job is questioning whether God would use His immense power to argue or dispute with him. In the context of the Book of Job, Job is in the midst of suffering and is seeking an audience with God to understand the reasons behind his afflictions. The term "contend" suggests a legal or judicial setting, which is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern context where legal disputes were common. Job's rhetorical question implies that he believes God, in His righteousness, would not simply overpower him with might but would engage justly. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites reasoning together.<p><b>No, He would certainly take note of me.</b><br>Here, Job expresses confidence that God would not dismiss him but would pay attention to his case. This reflects Job's faith in God's personal care and justice, despite his current suffering. The phrase "take note of me" suggests a personal and attentive response from God, indicating that Job believes God is not indifferent to human plight. This is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as one who is intimately aware of and concerned with human affairs, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God's knowledge of individuals is described in detail. Job's assertion also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's personal engagement with humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word becomes flesh and dwells among us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Though I were righteous, I could not answer Him&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14-15, 19</a>). He knows no human can survive a head-on clash with God&#8217;s might.<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture consistently shows that God&#8217;s greatness is not wielded like a tyrant&#8217;s club. In <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a> the Lord comes to Elijah not in the wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a gentle whisper. <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> portrays Him carrying His lambs close to His heart even while holding the universe in His hand (<a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; So Job&#8217;s question is rhetorical: would God meet him only with unstoppable force? The implied answer is no. God&#8217;s power is never divorced from His righteousness and compassion (<a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, He would certainly take note of me.</b><p>Job moves from fear to confidence: the Sovereign will listen.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and His ears are inclined to their cry&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). Job trusts that covenant reality even in confusion.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He knows the way that I take&#8221; (<a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>) echoes <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where every thought and step are fully known by God.<p>&#8226; Jesus later assures, &#8220;Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>). God&#8217;s meticulous care was not a new idea but the same truth Job clung to centuries earlier.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15-16</a> adds that we have a High Priest who sympathizes with our weaknesses; therefore we may &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence.&#8221; Job anticipates that welcome: if granted an audience, the Judge of all the earth would listen, weigh his words, and deal justly, not crush him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/23-6.htm">Job 23:6</a> balances reverence and assurance. God&#8217;s infinite power could overwhelm any creature, yet His character guarantees He hears and responds to His people.
