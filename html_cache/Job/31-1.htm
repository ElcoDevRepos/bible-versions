In biblical times, covenants were serious agreements, often involving solemn promises before God. Job's use of the term "covenant" indicates the gravity of his commitment to avoid lustful thoughts. The eyes are often seen as the gateway to the heart, and Job's proactive stance highlights the importance of guarding one's thoughts and intentions. This concept is echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where Jesus teaches that looking at someone with lust is akin to committing adultery in the heart. Job's covenant is a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on internal purity.<p><b>How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?</b><br>In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, a "virgin" would typically refer to an unmarried young woman. Job's rhetorical question underscores his commitment to moral integrity and respect for others. The act of "gazing with desire" implies more than a casual look; it suggests a lingering, lustful intent. This aligns with the wisdom literature's broader theme of avoiding temptation and maintaining righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>, which warns against lustful looks. Job's question also reflects a deep understanding of sin's progression, beginning with a look and potentially leading to more significant transgressions. This self-awareness and commitment to purity can be seen as a type of Christ, who was without sin and exemplified perfect self-control and respect for others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

His object, therefore, is to show his friends that he has really been more upright than their standard demanded or than they supposed him to be, till his affliction made them suspect him; and this uprightness was the consequence of rigid and inflexible adherence to principle, for he made a covenant with his eyes, as the avenues of sinful desires.
