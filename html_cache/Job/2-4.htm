In ancient Near Eastern culture, such expressions were common to convey the idea of equivalent exchange. The phrase implies that a person will sacrifice anything superficial to save their own life. It reflects the belief that physical well-being is of utmost importance to humans, a theme that resonates throughout the Book of Job as Job's physical suffering is central to the narrative.<p><b>Satan replied.</b><br>Satan, in the context of the Book of Job, acts as the accuser or adversary. His role here is to challenge the integrity of Job's faith. This interaction between God and Satan is unique to the prologue of Job and sets the stage for the testing of Job's righteousness. The presence of Satan in the heavenly court reflects the ancient belief in a divine council where spiritual beings have roles and responsibilities.<p><b>A man will give up all he owns in exchange for his life.</b><br>This statement underscores the value placed on life over material possessions. It suggests that when faced with life-threatening situations, individuals prioritize survival over wealth. This idea is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where Jesus questions the profit of gaining the world but losing one's soul. The statement also foreshadows the trials Job will face, as he is stripped of his possessions and health, yet his faith remains steadfast. This theme of testing and faithfulness is central to the narrative and serves as a type of Christ, who, though tested, remained faithful unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

No doubt a proverbial expression, resembling "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth; Tit for tat," and the like; but not expressive of retaliation. Satan means that, to keep his own "skin" intact, a man will sacrifice another's "skin;" even that of his nearest and dearest. Job, he insinuates, submitted to the loss of his children without a murmur, because he feared that otherwise God would stretch forth his hand against his person, and smite it or destroy it. He cannot imagine any motive for submission and apparent resignation but a selfish one (comp. <a href="/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9</a><span class="cmt_word">).

So the "false accuser."
