In the context of the Book of Job, Job feels that God is treating him as an enemy, despite his righteousness. This sentiment is echoed in other parts of Job, such as <a href="/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>, where Job laments that God has kindled His wrath against him. The imagery of being "torn" suggests a violent and painful experience, akin to being attacked by a wild animal, which is a common metaphor in ancient Near Eastern literature to describe divine judgment. This reflects the cultural understanding of suffering as a sign of divine displeasure.<p><b>He gnashes His teeth at me.</b><br>The gnashing of teeth is a vivid expression of intense anger and hostility. In biblical literature, this imagery is often associated with the wicked or those in torment, as seen in Psalms 37:12 and <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>. Here, Job uses it to describe what he perceives as God's fierce anger towards him. This anthropomorphic depiction of God highlights Job's deep sense of alienation and distress, as he feels that God is not only distant but actively hostile.<p><b>My adversary pierces me with His eyes.</b><br>The term "adversary" here can be understood as an opponent or enemy. In the broader narrative of Job, this reflects Job's struggle to comprehend why he is suffering and why God seems to be against him. The piercing gaze suggests scrutiny and judgment, reminiscent of the divine examination seen in other parts of scripture, such as <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4-5</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate adversary, Satan, who is described as the accuser in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>. The piercing eyes can be seen as a type of Christ, who in <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a> is described with eyes like a flame of fire, symbolizing His ability to see and judge all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Job perceives his suffering as coming from God, reflecting his struggle to understand his plight.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversary.htm">Adversary</a></b><br>In this context, Job feels as though he is being attacked by an adversary, which he attributes to God&#8217;s anger, though it can also be seen as a reflection of his inner turmoil and the spiritual battle he faces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Job&#8217;s expression of feeling attacked by God highlights the struggle to comprehend suffering.

Christians should be cautious about letting emotions dictate their understanding of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The adversarial language used by Job can remind believers of the spiritual battles they face. It is crucial to rely on God&#8217;s strength and armor to withstand such trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_amidst_trials.htm">Faith Amidst Trials</a></b><br>Despite his feelings, Job continues to engage with God, demonstrating a faith that seeks understanding and resolution. Believers are encouraged to maintain their faith and dialogue with God even when they feel overwhelmed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empathy_and_support.htm">Empathy and Support</a></b><br>Job&#8217;s friends failed to provide the support he needed.

Earlier he lamented, &#8220;The arrows of the Almighty are in me&#8221; (<a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>), and here the imagery intensifies.<p>- &#8220;Torn&#8221; recalls a wild animal attack (<a href="/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>). Job interprets his ordeal as divine aggression, not mere accident or human cruelty.<p>- Yet Scripture also shows that God&#8217;s anger can serve a refining purpose for His children (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a>). Even when discipline feels like opposition, it ultimately aims at restoration.<p>- Job&#8217;s words echo later reflections: &#8220;His wrath burns against me; He counts me among His enemies&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>). He is voicing raw anguish, not denying God&#8217;s justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He gnashes His teeth at me.</b><p>- &#8220;Gnashing teeth&#8221; paints a picture of relentless hostility. Psalms uses the same phrase of the wicked toward the righteous (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>), while Lamentations applies it to enemies mocking Jerusalem (<a href="/lamentations/2-16.htm">Lamentations 2:16</a>).<p>- Job, however, attributes that furious gaze to God Himself. His theology is under strain; pain distorts perception.<p>- In <a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a> the Sanhedrin &#8220;gnashed their teeth&#8221; at Stephen&#8212;another righteous sufferer. The image fits occasions when innocent believers are misunderstood, attacked, or persecuted.<p>- Satan prowls &#8220;like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), yet God remains sovereign over every roar. Job wrestles with that tension: how can a loving God allow a furious onslaught?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My adversary pierces me with His eyes.</b><p>- Job feels scrutinized and condemned. In <a href="/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a> he asks, &#8220;Why do You hide Your face and regard me as Your enemy?&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Pierces&#8221; suggests laser-sharp inspection, as though every flaw is spotlighted. The God whose &#8220;eyes are on the ways of a man&#8221; (<a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>) seems, to Job, intent on accusation.<p>- Scripture affirms that God&#8217;s eyes &#8220;are in every place&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>), discerning good and evil. For the believer, that gaze is ultimately protective (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>), but in agony Job mistakes it for hostility.<p>- Christ would later endure genuine divine abandonment on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), taking the place of sufferers like Job and providing the assurance that God&#8217;s searching eyes now look upon us with favor (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a> records a triple lament: torn by divine anger, assaulted by grinding teeth, and transfixed by a condemning stare. Job&#8217;s language is honest but not final truth; it captures how suffering can make God seem like an adversary. Cross-Scripture shows that the same God who disciplines also redeems, the same gaze that pierces also protects, and the fury Job perceives is ultimately resolved at the cross where Christ absorbed divine wrath so that believers, even in their darkest hours, can anchor their hope in the steadfast love of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He teareth me in his wrath.</span>--Terrible as the language is that Job has used against God, he seems here almost to exceed it, for he calls Him his adversary.
