This phrase suggests a gathering of divine beings in the heavenly court.

It reflects the idea of divine beings reporting to God, similar to a royal court where subjects present themselves before a king.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the divine name YHWH, emphasizing God's sovereignty and authority. This setting underscores God's supreme rule over all creation, including the spiritual realm.<p><b>and Satan also came with them</b><br>Satan's presence among the "sons of God" highlights his role as the accuser or adversary. The Hebrew term "Satan" means "adversary" or "accuser," and his appearance here sets the stage for the testing of Job's faith. This scene is reminiscent of <a href="/zechariah/3.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>, where Satan stands to accuse Joshua the high priest, illustrating his role in challenging the righteousness of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_god.htm">The Sons of God</a></b><br>This term refers to angelic beings who serve and worship God.

(Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>.) In the latter sense, a solemn thought is suggested by it to those who join in the public worship of God.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--The word appears in the Old Testament as the name of a specific person only here and in <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and possibly in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a> and <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6</a>. If this psalm is David's, according to the inscription, no reliance can be placed on speculations as to the late introduction of a belief in Satan among the Jews, nor, therefore, on any as to the lateness of these early chapters of Job. Precisely the same word is used, apparently as a common name, in the history of Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.

Here only and in Zechariah it is found with the definite article "the adversary." The theory of the personality of the evil one must largely depend upon the view we take of these and other passages of Scripture as containing an authoritative revelation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord</span>. By "the sons of God" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. Angels and men are alike "sons of God," as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the "Only Begotten," is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a> that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings<span class="cmt_word">. And Satan came also among them</span>. The word "Satan" has the article prefixed to it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> here and elsewhere in Job, as in <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a> and in <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - "the adversary" (comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, <span class="accented">passim</span>. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>), who is "the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses them before God day and night" (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Slanderer." The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.), and the descriptive epithet, "the Adversary," is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (<span class="accented">Angro-mainyus</span>) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
