In the context of Job, it symbolizes God's creation and power. The identity of Behemoth has been debated, with some suggesting it could be a hippopotamus, elephant, or even a now-extinct creature. The term itself is a plural form in Hebrew, possibly indicating greatness or majesty. This creature serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the complexity of His creation, which is beyond human understanding.<p><b>which I made along with you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Behemoth, like humans, is a creation of God. It underscores the shared origin of all living beings, pointing to the Genesis account of creation where God made all creatures. This connection highlights the order and intentionality in God's creation, suggesting that humans and animals are part of a larger divine plan. It also serves to remind Job of his place within the created order, reinforcing the theme of humility before God.<p><b>He feeds on grass like an ox</b><br>This description of Behemoth's diet suggests a peaceful, herbivorous nature, contrasting with the creature's immense size and strength. The comparison to an ox, a domesticated animal known for its strength and utility, may imply that even the most formidable creatures are under God's control and provision. This imagery can be linked to other biblical passages where God provides for all His creatures, such as <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>, which speaks of God providing grass for cattle. It also reflects the harmony and balance within God's creation, where even the mightiest creatures have their place and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of divine wisdom and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/behemoth.htm">Behemoth</a></b><br>A creature described by God, symbolizing His power and the majesty of His creation.

By calling Job to &#8220;look,&#8221; the Lord shifts the sufferer&#8217;s focus from his pain to the Creator&#8217;s power. By stressing their shared creation, God humbles human pride. By noting the beast&#8217;s grass-based diet, He highlights that even the most imposing creatures depend entirely on Him for their daily food. The verse, and the larger passage, reassure believers that the God who masters Behemoth is fully capable of overseeing every detail of our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Behemoth.</span>--The identification of behemoth has always been a great difficulty with commentators. The word in Hebrew is really the natural plural of beh?m?h, which means <span class= "ital">domestic cattle; </span>and this fact would suggest the idea that more than one animal may be meant in the description (<a href="/context/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15-24</a>), which scarcely seems to answer to one and the same. In this way the <a href="/context/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15-20</a> would describe very well the elephant, and <a href="/context/job/40-21.htm" title="He lies under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.">Job 40:21-24</a> the hippopotamus. The objection to this is, that beh?m?h is commonly used of domestic cattle in contrast to wild beasts, whereas neither the elephant nor the hippopotamus can come under the category of domestic animals. There is a word in Coptic (p-ehe-emmou, meaning water-ox), used for the hippopotamus, which may, perhaps, lie concealed in behemoth. Then the difficulty is to make the description answer throughout to the hippopotamus (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/job/40-20.htm" title="Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.">Job 40:20</a>), since the hippopotamus does not frequent mountains, neither does it exactly eat grass like an ox (<a href="/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which I made with thee.</span>--Fellow-creatures of thine, to inhabit the world with thee: thus skilfully reminding him that he had a common origin with the beasts. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - This passage, together with the whole of ch. 41, has been regarded by some critics as an interpolation. Its omission would certainly not affect the argument; and it is thought, in some respects, to contain traces of a later age than that which most commentators assign to the remainder of the book, or, at any rate, to the greater portion of it. The recurrence to the animal creation, when the subject seemed to have been completed (<a href="/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>), is also a difficulty. But, on the other hand, as there is no variation, either in the manuscripts or in the versions, and no marked difference either of style or tone of thought between the rest of the book and this controverted passage, it is best regarded as an integral portion of the work, proceeding from the same author, although perhaps at a later period. No one denies that the style is that of the best Hebrew poetry, or that the book would be weakened by the excision of the passage. "Le style," says M. Renan, "est celui des meilleurs endroits du poeme. Nulle part la coupe n'est pins vigoreuse, le parallelisme plus sonore.' <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold now behemoth</span>. "Behemoth" is ordinarily the plural of <span class="accented">behemah</span> "a beast;" but it is scarcely possible to understand the word in this sense in the present passage, where it seems to be a noun singular, being followed by singular verbs, and represented by singular pronouns. Hence modern critics almost unanimously regard the word here as designating "some particular animal." The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which I made with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "which I created at the same time as I created thee" (<a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He eateth grass as an ox</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is graminivorous, not carnivorous. This is admitted to be true of the hippopotamus, which lives in the Nile during the day, and at night emerges from the river, and devastates the crops of sugar-cane, rice, and millet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/40-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Look at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
