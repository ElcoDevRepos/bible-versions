In biblical times, the womb symbolized the beginning of life and nurturing. The idea that the womb forgets them implies a severance from the life-giving and nurturing aspects of existence. This can be seen as a reflection on the transient nature of life and the ultimate fate of those who live unjustly. In the broader context of Job, it emphasizes the seeming lack of justice in the world, where the wicked may prosper temporarily but are ultimately forgotten.<p><b>the worm feeds on them;</b><br>This imagery is a stark reminder of mortality and the physical decay that follows death. Worms are often associated with death and decay in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a> and <a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>, where they symbolize the corruption and destruction of the body. This serves as a metaphor for the inevitable judgment and the futility of earthly pursuits for those who live in wickedness. It underscores the biblical theme that earthly life is temporary and that true justice and recompense are found in the afterlife.<p><b>they are remembered no more.</b><br>The idea of being forgotten is significant in the biblical context, where remembrance often equates to honor and legacy. In contrast, being forgotten implies a lack of legacy and impact. This phrase highlights the ultimate insignificance of the wicked in the grand scheme of God's justice. <a href="/psalms/9-6.htm">Psalm 9:6</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a> also reflect on the fate of the wicked being forgotten, reinforcing the idea that their deeds do not endure. This serves as a warning against living a life contrary to God's will.<p><b>So injustice is broken like a tree.</b><br>The breaking of a tree symbolizes the sudden and complete downfall of the wicked. Trees in the Bible often represent strength and stability, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>. However, when a tree is broken, it signifies destruction and loss of power. This imagery suggests that despite the temporary success of the unjust, their end is certain and decisive. The breaking of injustice aligns with the prophetic hope found in scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where the Messiah will bring true justice. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who ultimately triumphs over sin and injustice, establishing God's righteous kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith who undergoes severe trials and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_womb.htm">The Womb</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the origin of life, which in this context, forgets the wicked after death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_worm.htm">The Worm</a></b><br>Represents decay and the inevitable return to dust, emphasizing the mortality of humans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/injustice.htm">Injustice</a></b><br>Personified as something that is ultimately broken, highlighting the temporary nature of evil.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree.htm">The Tree</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the breaking or downfall of injustice, suggesting that even strong, seemingly enduring things can be destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_life_and_injustice.htm">The Transience of Life and Injustice</a></b><br>Life is fleeting, and earthly injustices, though they may seem powerful, are temporary and will ultimately be broken.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitable_justice_of_god.htm">The Inevitable Justice of God</a></b><br>While injustice may seem to prevail, God's justice is inevitable and will ultimately triumph, as symbolized by the breaking of the tree.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_eternal_perspective.htm">The Importance of Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to focus on eternal values rather than temporary earthly gains, aligning with the teachings of Jesus about storing treasures in heaven.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith_in_trials.htm">The Role of Faith in Trials</a></b><br>Like Job, believers are called to maintain faith in God's justice and sovereignty, even when faced with apparent injustices and suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reminder_of_mortality.htm">The Reminder of Mortality</a></b><br>The imagery of the womb and the worm serves as a reminder of human mortality, urging believers to live with an awareness of their ultimate accountability to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_24_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 24:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_24_20_Consequences_of_wickedness.htm">How does Job 24:20 illustrate the consequences of living a wicked life?

By contrast, the wicked do not have that covenant security.<p>- The verse therefore stresses that once life ends, any claim to human compassion or familial attachment is gone for those who persist in evil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the worm feeds on them</b><p>- The statement is literal: their bodies decay in the grave, returning to dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a> pictures rebellious corpses &#8220;where their worm will not die,&#8221; and Jesus echoes it in <a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>, showing the physical reality of decay and the moral seriousness of judgment.<p>- Job counters the assumption that the wicked flourish forever by pointing to the inevitable moment when corruption overtakes their flesh.<p>- Physical decay serves as a visible sermon: sin produces death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are remembered no more</b><p>- Earthly fame is fleeting. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a> observes, &#8220;There is no remembrance of former generations.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> states, &#8220;The face of the LORD is against evildoers, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.&#8221;<p>- Job insists that, in the long run, wickedness leaves no honorable legacy.
