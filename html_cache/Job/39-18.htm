In the context of <a href="/job/39.htm">Job 39</a>, God is speaking to Job, highlighting the unique characteristics of various animals to demonstrate His wisdom and power in creation. The ostrich's wings, though not used for flight, are a symbol of its beauty and strength. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's creation, where each creature has its own purpose and design, even if it does not conform to human expectations. The spreading of wings can also symbolize freedom and confidence, attributes that are given by God to His creatures.<p><b>she laughs at the horse and its rider</b><br>The ostrich's ability to outrun a horse is a surprising and ironic twist, as horses are typically seen as symbols of speed and strength in the Bible. This imagery serves to humble human pride, as even the most powerful human inventions and abilities are nothing compared to the natural abilities God has instilled in His creation. The horse and rider are often associated with war and human might, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the Lord. The ostrich's "laughter" can be seen as a reminder of the limitations of human power and the superiority of God's wisdom. This also reflects the theme of divine sovereignty throughout the Book of Job, where God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

The ostrich has a habit of running in a curve, which alone enables horsemen to overtake and kill or capture her. As in <a href="/job/39-13.htm" title="Gave you the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich?">Job 39:13</a> a comparison seems to be drawn between the ostrich and the stork, so here, probably, the subject spoken of is the stork. Swift and powerful as the ostrich is, yet no sooner does the stork, on the contrary, rise on high into the air than she--as, indeed, any bird--can baffle the pursuit of horsemen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider</span>. The ostrich sometimes tries to elude pursuit by crouching and hiding behind hillocks or in hollows, making itself as little conspicuous as possible; but, when these attempts fail, and it starts off to run in the open, then it "lifts itself up" to its full elevation, beats the air with its wings, and scours along at a pace that no horse can equal. The Greeks with Xenophon, though well mounted, failed to catch a single ostrich ('Anab.,' 1:5. &sect; 3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/39-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1506;&#1461;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6256.htm">Strong's 6256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Time, now, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she proudly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;m&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4791.htm">Strong's 4791: </a> </span><span class="str2">Altitude</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spreads her wings,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(tam&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4754.htm">Strong's 4754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps to flap (the wings)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she laughs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1445;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#347;&#183;&#7717;aq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7832.htm">Strong's 7832: </a> </span><span class="str2">To laugh, to play</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the horse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1437;&#1505;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(las&#183;s&#363;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5483.htm">Strong's 5483: </a> </span><span class="str2">A swallow, swift (type of bird)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and its rider.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1469;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7392.htm">Strong's 7392: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ride, to place upon, to despatch</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/39-18.htm">OT Poetry: Job 39:18 When she lifts up herself on high (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/39-17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 39:17"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 39:17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/39-19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 39:19"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 39:19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
