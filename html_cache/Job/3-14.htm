In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings and counselors were often seen as the ultimate authorities, wielding significant control over their realms. The mention of "kings" suggests a connection to the broader biblical narrative where kingship is a central theme, such as in the stories of Saul, David, and Solomon. Counselors, or advisors, were crucial in decision-making processes, as seen in the roles of figures like Ahithophel and Hushai in the court of King David (2 Samuel 15-17). This phrase underscores the universality of death, as even those with great power eventually face mortality.<p><b>who built for themselves cities now in ruins</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the transient nature of human achievements. In the ancient world, building cities was a sign of power and legacy, as seen in the construction of cities like Babylon and Nineveh. Archaeological evidence from sites such as these reveals the grandeur and eventual decline of such civilizations. The ruins serve as a testament to the impermanence of human endeavors, echoing the biblical theme found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The imagery of ruins can be seen as a type pointing to the ultimate kingdom of God, which will never fall into ruin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
