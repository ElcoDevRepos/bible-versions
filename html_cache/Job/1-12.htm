It reflects the divine authority and control over all creation, including Satan. The dialogue between God and Satan is unique to the book of Job, illustrating the spiritual realm's influence on earthly events. This interaction is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God permits trials for a greater purpose, such as in the testing of Abraham (Genesis 22) and the temptation of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Everything he has is in your hands,</b><br>God grants Satan limited authority over Job's possessions, highlighting the theme of divine testing. This permission underscores the belief that God allows trials to refine and prove the faith of His followers. The phrase also emphasizes the temporary and controlled nature of Satan's power, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, where God promises not to allow believers to be tempted beyond what they can bear.<p><b>but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.&#8221;</b><br>Here, God sets a boundary to protect Job's life, demonstrating His ultimate control and care for His servants. This restriction shows that while God allows suffering, He also provides limits to it, ensuring the preservation of life. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus assures that not a single sparrow falls to the ground outside the Father's care (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).<p><b>Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</b><br>Satan's departure signifies the beginning of Job's trials and the unfolding of the narrative. This movement from the divine council to earthly action reflects the transition from heavenly decree to human experience. It parallels other biblical accounts where spiritual decisions manifest in the physical world, such as the fall of man in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> and the sending of the Holy Spirit in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God who permits Satan to test Job, demonstrating His ultimate authority and control over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary who challenges Job's integrity, seeking to prove that Job's faithfulness is contingent on his prosperity and blessings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A blameless and upright man, known for his fear of God and shunning of evil, who becomes the subject of a divine test.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_court.htm">Heavenly Court</a></b><br>The setting where the sons of God present themselves before the LORD, and where Satan also appears to challenge Job's righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_test.htm">The Test</a></b><br>The event where God allows Satan to test Job's faith by taking away his possessions, but not harming Job physically.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all circumstances, even when He allows trials.

God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (<a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. <span class="cmt_word">Only upon himself put not forth thine hand</span>. The <span class="accented">person</span> of Job was not to be touched as yet. He was to be injured only in his belongings. <span class="cmt_word">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord</span>. Having obtained a permission which he thought would serve his purpose, Satan did not delay, but promptly departed, to take advantage of the permission given him.
