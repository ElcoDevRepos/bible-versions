In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants were serious commitments often made between kings or nations. The rhetorical question implies the absurdity of a creature like Leviathan, representing chaos and untamable power, entering into a covenant with a human. This highlights God's sovereignty and the futility of human attempts to control or negotiate with such forces. Biblically, covenants are significant, as seen in God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, and David, which were divine promises rather than negotiations.<p><b>to take him as a slave for life?</b><br>The notion of taking Leviathan as a slave underscores the creature's immense power and the impossibility of subjugating it. In the ancient world, slavery was a common practice, often resulting from war or debt, and slaves were expected to serve their masters indefinitely. The imagery here emphasizes the futility of human efforts to dominate or domesticate Leviathan, a symbol of chaos and power beyond human control. This can be seen as a reflection of humanity's limitations and the need to recognize God's ultimate authority over creation. Theologically, it points to the idea that only God can truly master and control the forces of chaos, much like how Jesus calmed the storm in the Gospels, demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
