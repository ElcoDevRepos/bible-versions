In ancient times, travelers and merchants were often sources of news and information, as they moved between different regions and cultures. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking counsel and wisdom from a multitude of sources (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). The roads were the lifelines of trade and communication, and those who traveled them were akin to the wise men who brought news from afar (<a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>). This also connects to the idea of seeking understanding beyond one's immediate surroundings, as seen in the journeys of the patriarchs like Abraham and Jacob, who traveled extensively and gained wisdom through their experiences.<p><b>Do you not accept their reports?</b><br>This phrase challenges the listener to consider the testimonies and experiences of others. In the context of Job, it underscores the importance of listening to diverse perspectives, especially those who have witnessed the realities of life. The reports of travelers could include stories of justice and injustice, prosperity and suffering, which are central themes in the Book of Job. This echoes the biblical theme of bearing witness and the value of testimony, as seen in the New Testament where the apostles are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). It also highlights the importance of discernment in evaluating the truth of these reports, akin to the Bereans who examined the Scriptures daily to see if what they heard was true (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering. In this chapter, Job is responding to his friends' arguments about the fate of the wicked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who have been arguing that suffering is a direct result of sin.

Job appeals to that pattern: if impartial witnesses admit what they&#8217;ve seen, why won&#8217;t his friends?<p>&#8226; By calling on outside evidence, Job affirms the principle that truth is verifiable (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). His argument is not mere emotion; it rests on corroborated fact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you not accept their reports?</b><p>&#8226; Job confronts his friends&#8217; unwillingness to receive contrary evidence. They prefer a neat formula&#8212;good things happen to the righteous, bad things to the wicked (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting eyewitness accounts places them alongside those whom Isaiah describes: &#8220;seeing they do not perceive&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The reports challenge their theology, yet <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a> warns, &#8220;He who answers before listening&#8212;that is his folly and his shame.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job highlights a spiritual danger: when doctrine becomes so rigid that observable reality is dismissed, pride replaces humility (<a href="/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Accepting truthful reports, even uncomfortable ones, honors God, who is &#8220;the God of truth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>), and keeps believers from false judgments about others&#8217; suffering (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a> calls believers to broaden their perspective, listen to credible witnesses, and align their understanding of God&#8217;s dealings with the full scope of observable truth. Rather than forcing every circumstance into a tidy moral equation, we acknowledge that the wicked may flourish for a season while God&#8217;s ultimate justice still stands (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12&#8211;13</a>).
