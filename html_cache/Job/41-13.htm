The imagery of an "outer coat" suggests a protective layer that is impossible to remove, symbolizing invulnerability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, Leviathan is often associated with chaos and is depicted as a sea monster in various mythologies. The rhetorical question emphasizes human limitations in confronting such a formidable creature, highlighting God's supreme power over creation. This imagery can be connected to the armor of God described in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>, where believers are encouraged to put on spiritual armor to stand against evil forces.<p><b>Who can approach him with a bridle?</b><br>The bridle is a tool used to control and direct animals, particularly horses. The question implies that Leviathan is beyond human control, reinforcing the creature's untamable nature. This reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of human attempts to dominate or understand the divine order fully. In a cultural context, the bridle represents authority and mastery, which humans lack over Leviathan. This can be paralleled with <a href="/james/3-3.htm">James 3:3</a>, where the bridle is used metaphorically to describe the control of the tongue, suggesting that just as humans cannot control Leviathan, they struggle to control their own speech without divine help.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
