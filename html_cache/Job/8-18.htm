In the context of Job, Bildad is speaking about the fate of the wicked, implying that their removal from their established position is inevitable. Biblically, this can be connected to the idea of divine judgment, where God removes individuals from their place due to their actions, as seen in <a href="/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>. The imagery of uprooting is also used in <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>, where God speaks of uprooting nations as part of His judgment. The concept of being uprooted can symbolize instability and the loss of security, which is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible.<p><b>it will disown him</b><br>The land or place that once supported the individual now rejects him, indicating a complete severance of relationship. This reflects the cultural understanding of land and identity in the ancient Near East, where one's place was integral to their identity and legacy. The disowning suggests a loss of belonging and acceptance, which can be paralleled with the spiritual disowning seen in <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, where Jesus speaks of those who are not recognized by Him due to their iniquity. This phrase underscores the theme of alienation from God and community as a consequence of wickedness.<p><b>saying, &#8216;I never saw you.&#8217;</b><br>This personification of the land emphasizes the total erasure of the individual's presence and impact. It is as if the person never existed, highlighting the futility and transient nature of life without righteousness. This echoes the biblical theme of the forgotten wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>, where the wicked are no longer found. The phrase can also be seen as a type of divine judgment, where God, in His justice, allows the memory of the unrighteous to fade away, contrasting with the eternal remembrance of the righteous, as promised in <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15-16</a>. This serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of living a life aligned with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Just as a rootless vine cannot survive, so the wicked man&#8212;no matter how strong he appears&#8212;will be removed by God.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;uprooting&#8221; to describe divine judgment. &#8220;But God will strike you down forever; He will seize you and tear you from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>). See also <a href="/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-13.htm">Matthew 15:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores certainty. This isn&#8217;t a mere setback; it is God&#8217;s final action against a life that will not repent (compare <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will disown him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;It&#8221; refers to the very ground and setting that once nourished the man&#8217;s prosperity.

Bildad&#8217;s warning reminds us that only those whose lives are firmly rooted in the Lord endure, while every other foundation&#8212;wealth, reputation, environment&#8212;ultimately disowns the one who trusted in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he destroy him from his place</span>; or, <span class="accented">if he be destroyed.</span> The verb seems to be best taken as impersonal. If he be destroyed in any way, suddenly or gradually, by a Divine stroke, or by human agency, or by the comparatively slow process of nature, in any case the result is one, the flourishing plant is clean swept away, and the place of it knows it no more. Bildad's words are very dramatic and expressive. Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. The place shall be ashamed of having ever nurtured anything so vile, and shall declare that it never held such a growth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/8-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he is uprooted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1445;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7687;al&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#8216;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
