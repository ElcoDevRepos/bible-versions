In the context of Job, God is speaking to Job out of the whirlwind, illustrating His sovereignty and the mysteries of His creation that are beyond human understanding. The ostrich, known for its peculiar nesting habits, often leaves its eggs in the sand, seemingly neglecting them. This behavior can be seen as a reflection of the natural order established by God, where even what appears to be neglect serves a purpose in His grand design. The ostrich's actions can be compared to the ways in which God's plans may seem inscrutable or harsh to humans, yet they are part of His perfect wisdom.<p><b>with no concern that her labor was in vain</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the ostrich's lack of apparent concern for the potential loss of her eggs. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the ostrich was known for its speed and strength but also for its lack of wisdom, as perceived by humans. This serves as a reminder of the limitations of human understanding when it comes to divine wisdom. The phrase can be connected to other scriptures that speak of God's ways being higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). It also reflects the theme of trust in God's providence, as seen throughout the book of Job. The ostrich's behavior, while seemingly careless, is part of the natural order God has established, illustrating that what may seem futile to humans is not necessarily so in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, highlighting His wisdom and sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/ostrich.htm">Ostrich</a></b><br>The animal referenced in this verse, known for its seemingly neglectful behavior towards its young.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whirlwind.htm">The Whirlwind</a></b><br>The medium through which God communicates His message to Job, emphasizing His power and majesty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young.htm">The Young</a></b><br>The offspring of the ostrich, symbolizing vulnerability and the seeming lack of maternal care.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>The ostrich's behavior, though perplexing, is part of God's design.

The answer is, of course, God alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With no concern</b><p>&#8226; The bird&#8217;s seeming indifference dramatizes how limited human insight is.

God uses her to confront human pride: if He intentionally designed a bird whose parenting looks senseless, then His governance of our lives&#8212;including our suffering&#8212;is never senseless. The verse calls us to relinquish our demand for explanations and rest in the wise Creator who ordains every instinct, event, and outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers.</span> This is a deduction from what has preceded, and discloses no new fact. Recent careful observation of the habits of the ostrich indicates that the parental instinct is not wanting, though it may be weaker than in most birds. Both the male and the female incubate at night, and, when the nest is approached by the hunter, the parent bird or birds will leave it, and try to draw him away from it by running on in front of him, or feigning to attack him, much as peewits do in our own country. <span class="cmt_word">Her labour is in vain without fear</span>;
