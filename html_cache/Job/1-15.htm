This reflects the historical context of the time, where nomadic tribes often raided settled communities for livestock and goods. The suddenness of the attack is emphasized by the phrase "swooped down," indicating a swift and unexpected assault. This event is part of the series of calamities that befall Job, testing his faith and integrity.<p><b>They put the servants to the sword,</b><br>The phrase "put the servants to the sword" indicates a violent and ruthless attack, resulting in the death of Job's servants. This reflects the harsh realities of ancient warfare and the vulnerability of those living in isolated areas. The loss of servants not only represents a personal tragedy for Job but also a significant economic blow, as servants were essential for managing livestock and agricultural activities. This act of violence underscores the severity of Job's trials and the comprehensive nature of his losses.<p><b>and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</b><br>The lone survivor serves as a messenger, a common motif in ancient narratives, to convey the news of disaster. This emphasizes the totality of the destruction and the isolation of Job in his suffering. The phrase highlights the theme of witness and testimony, as the survivor's role is to inform Job of the calamity, setting the stage for Job's response to his trials. This also foreshadows the role of witnesses in the broader biblical narrative, where testimony is crucial for understanding and responding to God's actions and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, known for his faithfulness to God.

We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known.
