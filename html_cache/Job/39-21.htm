The valley often represents a place of preparation or testing in biblical literature. In ancient times, valleys were strategic locations for battles due to their flat terrain. The imagery of the horse pawing suggests eagerness and anticipation, reflecting the readiness of God's creation to fulfill its purpose. This can be connected to the spiritual readiness believers are called to have, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where the armor of God is described.<p><b>and rejoices in his strength;</b><br>The rejoicing in strength highlights the confidence and power inherent in the horse, a creature designed for war. This mirrors the biblical theme of finding joy and confidence in the strength provided by God. In a broader sense, it reflects the joy believers find in the strength of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>, "the joy of the Lord is your strength." The horse's strength is a gift from God, much like the spiritual gifts and strengths given to believers.<p><b>he charges into battle.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the courage and fearlessness of the horse, charging into the fray without hesitation. It reflects the biblical call to courage and faithfulness in the face of spiritual battles, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God commands Joshua to be strong and courageous. The horse's charge can also be seen as a type of Christ, who willingly faced the ultimate battle against sin and death. The imagery of charging into battle is a powerful reminder of the spiritual warfare Christians are engaged in, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, who is responding to Job, highlighting His creation and sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_horse.htm">The Horse</a></b><br>The subject of this verse, symbolizing strength, courage, and readiness for battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley.htm">The Valley</a></b><br>Represents a place of preparation and anticipation, where the horse readies itself for the coming challenge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>A metaphor for life's challenges and spiritual warfare, where strength and courage are tested.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strength_and_readiness.htm">Strength and Readiness</a></b><br>Just as the horse is prepared and eager for battle, Christians should be spiritually prepared and eager to face life's challenges with God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>This verse is part of God's discourse on His creation, reminding us of His power and control over all things, including our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_trials.htm">Courage in the Face of Trials</a></b><br>The horse's charge into battle symbolizes the courage we must have when facing spiritual and personal battles, trusting in God's provision and strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_strength.htm">Joy in God's Strength</a></b><br>The horse rejoices in its strength, teaching us to find joy in the strength God provides us to overcome obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_spiritual_warfare.htm">Preparation for Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Like the horse preparing for battle, we must equip ourselves with God's Word and prayer to stand firm in spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_39_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 39:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_21_God_s_power_in_creation.htm">How does Job 39:21 illustrate God's power in creation and nature's order?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_sovereignty_in_horse_s_strength.htm">What can we learn about God's sovereignty from the horse's strength in Job 39:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Job_39_21_Ps_147_10-11_on_delight.htm">How does Job 39:21 connect to Psalm 147:10-11 about God's delight?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_horse_s_boldness_to_faith.htm">How can we apply the horse's boldness to our faith in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_21_Trust_God_s_design_in_us.htm">What does Job 39:21 teach about trusting God's design in our abilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_21_God_s_power_in_nature.htm">What does Job 39:21 reveal about God's creation and control over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Job_39_21_show_horse_s_power.htm">How does Job 39:21 illustrate the power and majesty of the horse?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_horse_imagery_in_Job_39_21.htm">Why does God use the imagery of a horse in Job 39:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_disasters.htm">Why does God allow suffering?

Canon Cook appositely compares Virgil's "carat tellurem" ('Georg.,' 3:87, 88), and Professor Lee Pope's expression, that "ere they start a thousand steps are lost." The verb is in the plural, because a line of cavalry, all pawing and eager to be off, is intended to be represented. And rejoiceth in his strength. Nothing is more remarkable than the eagerness and joy which war-horses show when the battle approaches. They are generally more excited than their riders. He goeth on to meet the armed men; literally, <span class="accented">he rusheth upon the weapons</span>. Equally true in ancient and in modern warfare. The main use of cavalry is in the charge (see Denison's 'Hist. of Cavalry,' pp. 507-512). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/39-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He paws</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7717;&#183;p&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2658.htm">Strong's 2658: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pry into, to delve, to explore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the valley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1453;&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;meq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6010.htm">Strong's 6010: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vale</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and rejoices</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7797.htm">Strong's 7797: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bright, cheerful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his strength;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1425;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3581.htm">Strong's 3581: </a> </span><span class="str2">A small reptile (of unknown species)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he charges</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1437;&#1510;&#1461;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into battle.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#353;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5402.htm">Strong's 5402: </a> </span><span class="str2">Military equipment, arms, an arsenal</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/39-21.htm">OT Poetry: Job 39:21 He paws in the valley and rejoices (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/39-20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 39:20"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 39:20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/39-22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 39:22"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 39:22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
