In the context of the Book of Job, Zophar, one of Job's friends, is expressing a wish that God would directly address Job's situation. This longing for God to speak is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in instances like Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Elijah on Mount Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>). The desire for God to speak underscores the belief in His ultimate authority and wisdom, which is a central tenet of the faith.<p><b>and open His lips against you,</b><br>Zophar implies that if God were to speak, it would be in correction or rebuke of Job. This reflects the cultural and theological understanding of retribution theology prevalent in the ancient Near East, where suffering was often seen as a direct result of personal sin. The phrase also highlights the tension between human understanding and divine wisdom, a theme that runs throughout the Book of Job. This anticipation of divine correction can be compared to other biblical instances where God addresses human sin, such as His conversations with Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) and Cain (Genesis 4). The expectation of God's rebuke also foreshadows the eventual divine speeches in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God addresses Job directly, emphasizing His sovereignty and the limitations of human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Zophar&#8217;s desire is therefore understandable: he wants the argument to move from human reasoning to divine authority.<p>- Yet there is irony: God will indeed speak later (<a href="/bsb/job/38.htm">Job 38&#8211;41</a>), but His words will vindicate Job&#8217;s integrity and rebuke the friends (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-9</a>). This reminds us that longing for God&#8217;s voice must be coupled with humility, since His verdict may overturn our assumptions (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and open His lips against you</b><p>- Zophar expects God to &#8220;open His lips&#8221; in accusation, revealing Job&#8217;s supposed guilt. The phrase pictures a courtroom where the Judge announces charges (<a href="/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>).<p>- He is sure that a holy God cannot overlook sin (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>) and therefore assumes Job is at fault. His theology is partly right&#8212;God does expose sin (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>)&#8212;but he misapplies it by ignoring the possibility of innocent suffering (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>).<p>- Later, when God speaks, He does not list Job&#8217;s sins; instead He questions Job&#8217;s understanding of the Creator&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>). The &#8220;accusation&#8221; turns toward the friends: &#8220;You have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>).<p>- The lesson: desire God&#8217;s examination, but be prepared for His verdict to address our own hearts first (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/11-5.htm">Job 11:5</a> records Zophar&#8217;s wish that God would interrupt the debate and settle Job&#8217;s claims of innocence.
