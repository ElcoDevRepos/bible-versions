In the context of the Book of Job, this rhetorical question underscores the belief that humans, by nature, are not pure due to the original sin introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The idea of human impurity is echoed in <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>, where David acknowledges being sinful from birth. The rhetorical nature of the question suggests that purity is not achievable by human effort alone, pointing to the need for divine intervention and grace.<p><b>or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?</b><br>The phrase "born of woman" emphasizes the natural human condition, highlighting the universal experience of birth and the inherited sin nature. This reflects the biblical understanding that all humans are born into sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The question of righteousness is central to the biblical narrative, where true righteousness is seen as a gift from God rather than a human achievement. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who, though born of a woman (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), lived a sinless life and offers His righteousness to believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The phrase challenges the reader to consider the limitations of human righteousness apart from divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
