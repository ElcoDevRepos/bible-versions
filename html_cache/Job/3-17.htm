The "wicked" refers to those who cause suffering and injustice. In the context of the ancient Near East, societal structures often allowed the powerful to oppress the weak, and Job's lament reflects a desire for divine justice. Biblically, this echoes themes found in Psalms and Proverbs, where the ultimate downfall of the wicked is assured (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>, <a href="/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19-20</a>). The cessation of "raging" suggests a finality to the chaos and evil that the wicked perpetuate, aligning with prophetic visions of a future where God establishes peace and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>).<p><b>and there the weary find rest</b><br>This phrase highlights the hope for relief from suffering and toil. The "weary" can be seen as those burdened by life's hardships, a common theme in Job's narrative. In the historical context, labor was physically demanding, and rest was a precious commodity. Theologically, this rest can be seen as a type of the eternal rest promised to believers, as referenced in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>. The concept of rest is also tied to the Sabbath, a divine ordinance for physical and spiritual renewal (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus offers rest to the weary and burdened, symbolizing spiritual peace and salvation (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). This connection underscores the hope of ultimate rest in God's presence, free from the trials of earthly life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
