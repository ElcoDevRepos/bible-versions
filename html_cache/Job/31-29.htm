In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, personal vendettas and rejoicing over an enemy's downfall were common. However, Job's statement aligns with the biblical principle of loving one's enemies, as later emphasized by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. The idea of not rejoicing over an enemy's misfortune is also echoed in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>, which advises against gloating when an enemy falls. This reflects a heart attitude that values compassion and forgiveness over vengeance.<p><b>or exulted when evil befell him&#8212;</b><br>Job continues to emphasize his moral integrity by stating that he has not taken pleasure in the misfortunes of his adversaries. This attitude is consistent with the teachings found throughout Scripture, which advocate for empathy and kindness even towards those who oppose us. The historical context of Job's time would have seen such restraint as countercultural, as retribution was often expected. This anticipates the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who exemplified forgiveness and love for enemies, as seen in <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a> when He asked for forgiveness for those who crucified Him. Job's stance here can be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the perfect love and forgiveness that Jesus would later embody.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
