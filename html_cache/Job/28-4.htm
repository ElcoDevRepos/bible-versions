In the ancient Near East, mining was often conducted in desolate areas, far from cities and towns. This reflects the lengths to which humans go to extract valuable resources, paralleling the search for wisdom, which is also rare and requires effort to obtain. The isolation can also symbolize the spiritual journey, where one must often step away from the familiar to seek deeper understanding.<p><b>he cuts a shaft</b><br>The imagery of cutting a shaft refers to the labor-intensive process of mining, which involved digging deep into the earth to reach precious metals and stones. This can be seen as a metaphor for the pursuit of wisdom, which requires diligence and perseverance. The act of cutting a shaft also suggests the idea of creating a path or access to something hidden, much like the pursuit of divine wisdom that is not readily visible or accessible.<p><b>in places forgotten by the foot of man</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the obscurity and hidden nature of the mining locations. It suggests areas that are not frequently traveled or known, reinforcing the idea that true wisdom is not found in common or easily accessible places. Biblically, this can be connected to the concept of seeking God in solitude or in the wilderness, as seen in the experiences of figures like Moses and Elijah, who encountered God away from the crowds.<p><b>Far from men he dangles and sways</b><br>The image of a miner dangling and swaying conveys the precarious and dangerous nature of mining work. It underscores the risk and dedication involved in the pursuit of valuable resources, paralleling the spiritual risk and commitment required to seek wisdom. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who left the safety of heaven to dwell among men, taking on the dangers and burdens of humanity to bring forth the treasure of salvation. The solitary figure of the miner can symbolize Christ's unique role as the mediator between God and man, undertaking a task that no one else could accomplish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.

This passage is very obscure; but recent critics suggest, as its probable meaning, "He (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the miner) breaketh open a shaft, away from where men inhabit" (see the Revised Version). The miner does not wish to be interfered with, and therefore sinks his shaft in some wild spot, far from the habitations of men.
