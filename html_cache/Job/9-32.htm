Job acknowledges the vast difference between the divine nature and human nature. In biblical context, this reflects the consistent theme of God's holiness and separateness from creation, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than those of humans. Theologically, it underscores the Creator-creature distinction, emphasizing that God is not subject to human limitations or weaknesses.<p><b>that I can answer Him</b><br>Job expresses his inability to respond to God on equal terms. This reflects the human condition of limited understanding and power in contrast to God's omniscience and omnipotence. In the broader narrative of Job, this sentiment is echoed in God's speeches later in the book (Job 38-41), where God questions Job, highlighting Job's limited knowledge. This phrase also points to the need for humility before God, recognizing that human wisdom is insufficient to fully comprehend divine purposes.<p><b>that we can take each other to court</b><br>The imagery of a legal dispute suggests a desire for a mediator or arbiter between Job and God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, legal proceedings were a common way to resolve disputes, but Job recognizes that such a process is impossible with God due to His supreme authority. This longing for a mediator foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The concept of divine justice and the human quest for understanding it is a central theme in the book of Job, reflecting the struggle to reconcile suffering with faith in a just God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The light that has shined upon us was shining then in the heart of Job, and shines for ever in the pages of his book. Job felt, as he had been taught to feel, that in himself there not only was no hope, but no possibility of justification with God, unless there should be an umpire and impartial mediator, who could make the cause of both his own, and reconcile and unite the two in himself. It is useless to inquire what other particular form the aspiration of Job may have taken, or how far he understood and meant what he said; but here are his words, and this is what they must mean, and it is for us to adore the wisdom by which they were taught accurately to correspond with what we know has been given to us by God. We know that a daysman has laid his hand upon us both; and while we see that this is what Job wanted, we cannot but see more plainly that this is what we want. It is to be observed that this word daysman, or judge, is immediately connected with the Scripture phrase, "the <span class= "ital">day </span>of the Lord," and St. Paul's words, "the <span class= "ital">day </span>shall declare it" (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; and we should come together in judgment</span> (comp. vers. 2-14). On one of two conditions only, Job thinks, could the contest be even between himself and God. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If God, divesting himself of all his Divine attributes, became man; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some thirdsman could be found, some umpire or arbitrator, to preside over the contest, and decide it. Neither condition, however, was (he thought) possible; and therefore no satisfactory judgment could take place. Recent commentators observe that the Christian scheme, which Job could not anticipate, provides almost a literal fulfilment of both conditions, since the God who is to judge us is "true Man," and is also a Mediator, or "Thirds-man," between us and the offended Father, with authority to make the final decision, 'the Father having committed all judgment unto the Son "(<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), and" given him authority to execute judgment also'" for the very reason that he is "the Son of man" (<a href="/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
