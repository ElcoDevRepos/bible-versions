In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, loyalty to friends and family was paramount, and betrayal was seen as a grave sin. The act of denouncing friends for personal gain echoes the actions of Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). This connection underscores the timeless nature of the warning against placing monetary gain above relationships and moral duty. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical principle that God values truth and loyalty, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, which emphasizes the importance of a friend who loves at all times.<p><b>the eyes of his children will fail</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a generational consequence for the actions of the father, a common theme in the Old Testament where the sins of one generation can affect the next (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). The "eyes of his children will fail" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the loss of hope or future prospects, indicating that the consequences of betrayal and moral failure extend beyond the individual to impact their descendants. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where actions have long-term consequences. The imagery of failing eyes may also symbolize a lack of vision or understanding, suggesting that the children may suffer from a lack of moral guidance or spiritual insight due to the father's actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who visit Job to offer counsel but often misinterpret his situation and accuse him of wrongdoing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who allows Job's testing and ultimately restores him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary who challenges Job's faithfulness, initiating his trials.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_betrayal.htm">The Consequences of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betraying friends for personal gain can lead to dire consequences, not only for the betrayer but also for their descendants.

It signals a timeless moral principle&#8212;God observes every choice and holds each person accountable (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Denounces his friends</b><p>To &#8220;denounce&#8221; is to betray, accuse, or indict those who should be closest. David experienced similar treachery: &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230;has lifted up his heel against me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). Betrayal violates the covenant bond of friendship that Proverbs celebrates: &#8220;A friend loves at all times&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>). Here Job may be hinting at the harsh speeches his companions have hurled against him (<a href="/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For a price</b><p>The betrayal is motivated by gain. Scripture repeatedly condemns selling out righteousness for money:<p>&#8226; &#8220;A wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Woe to those&#8230;who acquit the guilty for a bribe&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22-23</a>).<p>This foreshadows Judas, who handed over Jesus &#8220;for thirty pieces of silver&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). God sees such transactions and records them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The eyes of his children will fail</b><p>Consequences extend beyond the betrayer: &#8220;the eyes of his children will fail.&#8221; In the Old Testament, family often shared in the fallout of a parent&#8217;s sin (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>). &#8220;Failing eyes&#8221; picture children waiting in vain for help that never comes (<a href="/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17</a>). While each soul is responsible before God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>), parental choices can set patterns of loss and sorrow that echo through generations (<a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a> warns that betraying friends for material gain invites judgment so severe it can touch one&#8217;s offspring.
