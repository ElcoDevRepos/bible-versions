Straw, being lightweight and insubstantial, is easily carried away by the wind. In biblical literature, wind often symbolizes judgment or the fleeting nature of life (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>). The rhetorical question suggests the transience and instability of the wicked, contrasting with the perceived prosperity of the unrighteous. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>, where God&#8217;s power is depicted as blowing away the wicked like stubble.<p><b>like chaff swept away by a storm?</b><br>Chaff refers to the husks separated from grain during threshing, which are useless and discarded. In the Bible, chaff often symbolizes worthlessness and is used to describe the fate of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). The storm represents divine judgment, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). This phrase underscores the ultimate futility and destruction awaiting those who oppose God, despite their temporary success. The imagery of chaff and storm is a powerful reminder of the sovereignty of God over human affairs and the eventual triumph of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

The righteous can trust God&#8217;s eventual justice even when they cannot trace it in the moment.<p>&#8226; Takeaway: God&#8217;s storm will separate the worthless from the valuable.
