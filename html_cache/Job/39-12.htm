In the ancient Near Eastern context, agriculture was a central part of life, and the harvest was crucial for survival. Trusting an animal to bring in the grain implies a dependence on its strength and reliability. This reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty and the limitations of human control over nature. The wild ox, or "re'em" in Hebrew, symbolizes untamed power, which humans cannot fully harness or trust, pointing to the need to rely on God rather than on human or animal strength. This can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which emphasizes trusting in the Lord rather than one's own understanding.<p><b>and gather it to your threshing floor?</b><br>The threshing floor was a significant location in ancient agricultural societies, where grain was separated from chaff. It was often a communal space and sometimes had religious significance, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz (<a href="/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6-14</a>) and the purchase of the threshing floor by David, which later became the site of the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>). The imagery of gathering grain to the threshing floor suggests a process of provision and preparation, but also of judgment and separation, as seen in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>, where John the Baptist speaks of Jesus gathering the wheat into the barn and burning the chaff. This phrase underscores the idea that while humans can prepare and plan, ultimate provision and judgment belong to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice and wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of divine wisdom and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wild_ox.htm">Wild Ox (Re'em)</a></b><br>A symbol of strength and untamed power, used by God to illustrate His control over creation and the limitations of human power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Just as Job is challenged to trust in God's control over creation, we are called to trust in His sovereignty over our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_limitations.htm">Human Limitations</a></b><br>Recognize our limitations in understanding and controlling the world, and submit to God's greater wisdom and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god_for_provision.htm">Dependence on God for Provision</a></b><br>Like the wild ox, which cannot be fully tamed or trusted by humans, we must rely on God to provide and gather our needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_unseen_outcomes.htm">Faith in Unseen Outcomes</a></b><br>Trusting God involves faith in outcomes we cannot see or control, much like trusting the wild ox to gather grain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Acknowledge our place in creation and approach God with humility, recognizing His ultimate authority and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_39_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 39:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_12_God_s_control_in_nature.htm">How does Job 39:12 illustrate God's control over nature and provision for needs?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_with_grain_faith_lesson.htm">What does trusting God with "your grain" teach about faith in His provision?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_12_God_s_sovereignty_insight.htm">How can Job 39:12 deepen our understanding of God's sovereignty in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/God_s_care_Job_39_12_Matt_6_26.htm">Connect Job 39:12 with Matthew 6:26 on God's care for His creation.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Job_39_12_trust_daily.htm">How can we apply the trust in Job 39:12 to our daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_12_God_s_control_human_reliance.htm">What does Job 39:12 reveal about God's control over nature and human reliance on it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Job_39_12_Divine_providence_vs_duty.htm">How does Job 39:12 challenge our understanding of divine providence and human responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Job_39_12_show_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways does Job 39:12 reflect the theme of trust in God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_proverbs_11_22_say_on_beauty.htm">Has Satan requested to test you like wheat?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_stop_sinful_body_actions.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'raise him up'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_essence_of_divine_truth.htm">What does 'chaff' mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_91_contradict_job's_suffering.htm">In light of biblical accounts where the righteous do suffer (e.g., Job), does Psalm 91 contradict other Scriptures regarding God's protection?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Job 39:12 Mean</div><b>Can you trust him</b><p>The &#8220;him&#8221; is the untamed wild ox God has just described (<a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9&#8211;11</a>).

By contrast, God alone commands absolute trust (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes human limitation. If we cannot trust a powerful beast to serve us, how much more should we humbly accept that only the Creator is worthy of full confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bring in your grain</b><p>Harvest is life-sustaining. Losing grain meant famine in the agrarian culture of Scripture (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48&#8211;49</a>).<p>&#8226; The wild ox possesses brute strength, yet that force cannot be enlisted to secure the crop.<p>&#8226; God alone oversees the seasons and yields (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>); He &#8220;gives food to every creature&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/136-25.htm">Psalm 136:25</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a> praises the tiny ant for gathering food&#8212;another reminder that success in harvest comes from God&#8217;s design, not human or animal might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gather it</b><p>Gathering is the careful work of drawing scattered stalks into safe storage (<a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Strength without obedience cannot complete delicate tasks. <a href="/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18</a> shows the landowner building bigger barns, but even in that parable God, not the owner, controls the outcome (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord gathers His people as surely as He gathers grain (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).
