Her presence highlights the personal and familial impact of Job's suffering. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, a wife's role was to support her husband, yet here she voices despair. This moment underscores the depth of Job's trials, affecting not just his physical and material state but also his closest relationships.<p><b>&#8220;Do you still retain your integrity?</b><br>Integrity in this context refers to Job's steadfastness and moral uprightness. Despite his immense suffering, Job has not sinned or spoken against God. This question from his wife challenges the value of maintaining faithfulness amidst adversity. It reflects a common human struggle: the temptation to abandon principles when faced with overwhelming hardship. This theme of integrity is central to the book of Job and is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>, which emphasizes the guidance of integrity.<p><b>Curse God and die!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct challenge to Job's faith and a suggestion to abandon his reverence for God. The term "curse" here is significant, as it implies a complete renunciation of God, which was considered a grave sin. The suggestion to "die" may reflect a belief that death would be preferable to continued suffering, a sentiment found in other biblical texts like <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>, where Elijah wishes for death. This moment also foreshadows the ultimate test of faith that Jesus Christ would endure, maintaining His integrity and obedience to God even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Now she can endure no longer. To see her husband so afflicted, and so patient under his afflictions, is more than she can bear. Her mind is weak and ill regulated, and she suffers herself to become Satan's ally and her husband's worst enemy.
