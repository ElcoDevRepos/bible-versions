In the context of Job, Eliphaz is accusing Job of being in such a state due to his alleged sins. Darkness in the Bible often symbolizes chaos, evil, or the absence of God's presence (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). It can also represent a lack of understanding or insight (<a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>). Theologically, this darkness can be seen as a metaphor for the separation from God that sin causes, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><b>and a flood of water covers you</b><br>Flood imagery in the Bible often signifies overwhelming trouble or judgment. The flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a> is the most prominent example, where water is used as a means of divine judgment. In the Psalms, floods are frequently used metaphorically to describe overwhelming distress or the threat of destruction (<a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69:1-2</a>, <a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4-5</a>). In the context of Job, Eliphaz suggests that Job is being overwhelmed by divine judgment due to his supposed unrighteousness. This imagery also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus calms the storm (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>), symbolizing His power over chaos and His ability to bring peace amidst life's storms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Spiritually, they picture overwhelming anguish when God&#8217;s protection is withdrawn (<a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; 69:1-2).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz again misreads Job&#8217;s situation, assuming the flood proves personal wickedness. Yet God will later declare Job blameless (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; 42:7).<p>&#8226; The metaphor reminds every reader that safety lies only in God&#8217;s ark of salvation. When storms rise, He remains &#8220;a refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a> stacks two vivid pictures&#8212;thick darkness and a covering flood&#8212;to argue that Job&#8217;s sufferings are the direct result of secret sin. While Eliphaz draws legitimate symbols of divine judgment from Scripture&#8217;s own storehouse, he errs by assuming that suffering always equals guilt. The verse therefore serves both as a sober warning about the real consequences of sin and as a call to trust the God who rescues from night and torrent alike, ultimately revealed in Jesus Christ, the Light of the world and the Rock that stands firm when waters rise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or darkness, that thou canst not see</span>.
