Papyrus boats were lightweight and swift, used in ancient Egypt for travel along the Nile. This imagery suggests speed and transience, emphasizing how quickly Job feels his days are passing without relief. The use of papyrus boats connects to the broader biblical context of Egypt, a place often associated with both refuge and bondage for the Israelites. The swift passage of time is a common theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, which speaks of the brevity of life.<p><b>like an eagle swooping down on its prey</b><br>The eagle is a powerful bird of prey, known for its keen sight and swift, decisive action. This imagery conveys a sense of inevitability and the suddenness with which Job's troubles have come upon him. In the Bible, eagles often symbolize strength and swiftness, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who hope in the Lord will "soar on wings like eagles." Here, however, the eagle represents the relentless and overwhelming nature of Job's afflictions. The cultural context of the ancient Near East, where eagles were respected for their prowess, adds to the intensity of this metaphor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Literally, <span class= "ital">ships of Eveh, </span>probably a proper name, and perhaps referring to a particular kind of boat in use on the Nile; if so, this is one instance out of many of Job's acquaintance with Egypt. The Vulgate has, <span class= "ital">naves poma portantes. </span>Job is a problem to himself; he is confident of his innocence, and yet he is confident that that very innocence will avail him nothing before God, he is sure that he must be condemned. Now, it is impossible to deny that this is the very attitude of the Gospel; it is, therefore, if we bear in mind the vast antiquity of the confession, both a witness to the truth of the Gospel and an anticipation of it that God alone could give. Indeed, it is hopelessly impossible to enter into the position of Job unless we are ourselves enlightened with the teaching of the Gospel, and able to look at it from the Gospel standpoint. While, therefore, admitting this fact, we are the better able to appreciate the wonderful confession Job is about to make in <a href="/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-33</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are passed away as the swift ships</span>; literally, <span class="accented">like the ships of reed.</span> The allusion is probably to the frail reed vessels of the Egyptians, of which many ancient writers speak (see Theophrastus, 'Hist. Plant.,' 4:9; Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:56; 13:11; Luean, ' Pharsalis,' 4:36, etc.). They were long, light canoes, formed generally of the papyrus plant, and propelled either by a single paddle or by a punting-pole. They were fiat-bottomed and broad, like punts, with a stem and stern rising considerably above the level of the water (see the authofs 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 507, 508). Isaiah speaks of them as "vessels of bulrushes," in which "swift messengers" were sent by the nations peopling the banks of the Nile (<a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1, 2</a>). The Euphrates boats described by Herodotus (1:194) were of an entirely different construction, and cannot be here intended. They consisted of a framework of wood, which was covered with skins, and then coated with bitumen, and resembled the Welsh "coracles<span class="cmt_word">." As the eagle that hasteth to the prey</span>; or, <span class="accented">as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey</span> (Revised Version). Job's observation presents to him three types of swiftness - the trained runner upon the earth, the swift ships upon the waters, and the hungry eagle in the air. It seems to him that his life passes away as swiftly as any of these. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They sweep by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1453;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2498.htm">Strong's 2498: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slide by, to hasten away, pass on, spring up, pierce, change</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">boats</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1459;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;o&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_591.htm">Strong's 591: </a> </span><span class="str2">A ship</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of papyrus,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1489;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7687;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_16.htm">Strong's 16: </a> </span><span class="str2">Reed, papyrus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like an eagle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1504;&#1462;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;ne&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
