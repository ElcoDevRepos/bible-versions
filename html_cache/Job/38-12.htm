It serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of human life, contrasting with God's eternal existence. This is a theme found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God's everlasting nature.<p><b>have you commanded the morning</b><br>This question highlights God's sovereign control over creation, specifically the daily cycle of day and night. The morning is depicted as something that God commands, illustrating His authority over time and nature. This echoes the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks light into existence. It also reflects the idea that God is actively involved in sustaining the world, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, where Christ is described as holding all things together.<p><b>or assigned the dawn its place</b><br>The dawn is portrayed as having a specific role and position, determined by God. This suggests order and purpose in creation, countering any notion of randomness. The imagery of dawn is often used in Scripture to symbolize new beginnings and hope, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning. The dawn can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "morning star" in <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>, symbolizing His role as the bringer of light and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
