In the biblical context, God's wrath is often associated with His righteous judgment against sin and pride. The imagery of unleashing fury is reminiscent of God's actions in the Old Testament, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). These events demonstrate God's ability to execute judgment and maintain moral order. Theologically, this phrase underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His ultimate authority over creation, a theme prevalent throughout the Book of Job.<p><b>look on every proud man</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in Scripture, often depicted as a sin that leads to downfall. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, pride was seen as a significant vice, often leading to conflict and divine retribution. This phrase calls to mind God's omniscience, His ability to see into the hearts of men, and His awareness of human arrogance. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>and bring him low.</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of divine justice, where God humbles those who exalt themselves. The act of bringing the proud low is a demonstration of God's power to reverse human fortunes, a concept seen in the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>) where Mary praises God for bringing down rulers from their thrones. Historically, this reflects the belief that God actively intervenes in human affairs to uphold justice. Theologically, it points to the eschatological hope that God will ultimately set things right, a theme echoed in the prophetic literature where the proud are judged, and the humble are exalted (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through immense suffering.
