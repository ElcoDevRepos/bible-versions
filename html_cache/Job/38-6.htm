In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the earth was often depicted as having a solid foundation, reflecting a common understanding of stability and order. The imagery of foundations suggests a deliberate and purposeful act of creation, aligning with the biblical theme that God is the ultimate architect of the universe. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>, which speaks of God setting the earth on its foundations so it can never be moved. The rhetorical question highlights human limitations in understanding the mysteries of creation, contrasting with God's omniscience.<p><b>or who laid its cornerstone</b><br>The cornerstone is a critical element in construction, symbolizing the starting point and stability of a structure. In biblical times, the cornerstone was the first stone set in the foundation, determining the position of the entire building. This imagery is used to illustrate God's role as the master builder of the earth. The cornerstone also has messianic implications, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where the Messiah is described as a precious cornerstone. In the New Testament, Jesus is identified as the cornerstone in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>, signifying His foundational role in the church and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. This connection underscores the continuity of God's plan from creation to redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of the universe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whirlwind.htm">The Whirlwind</a></b><br>The medium through which God speaks to Job, symbolizing His power and majesty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foundations_of_the_earth.htm">Foundations of the Earth</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the creation of the world, emphasizing God's role as the Creator.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornerstone.htm">Cornerstone</a></b><br>A symbolic element in construction, representing the starting point and stability of a structure, here used to illustrate God's wisdom in creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God alone has the wisdom and power to create and sustain the universe.

Creation is therefore orderly, intentional, and utterly dependent on the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture the cornerstone image also foreshadows Christ, the One through whom and for whom all things were made (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).
