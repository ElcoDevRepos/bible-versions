The rhetorical question implies that God's wisdom and understanding are beyond human comprehension. This is consistent with other biblical passages such as <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, which speak of God's unparalleled wisdom. The idea that no one can instruct God underscores His sovereignty and the futility of human pride. In the context of Job, this statement challenges the assumptions of Job's friends, who presume to understand God's ways and judgments.<p><b>since He judges those on high?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's authority over all, including celestial beings or those in positions of power. The phrase "those on high" can refer to angels or heavenly beings, as well as earthly rulers, indicating that God's jurisdiction is universal. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>, where God presides over a divine council, and <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>, which speaks of God's dominion over all the earth. The assertion that God judges even the highest beings reinforces His ultimate authority and justice, a theme that runs throughout the book of Job. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the judge of all, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.

If the reader prefers to understand these latter verses in any other way, it is open to him to do so, but in our judgment it seems better to understand them thus. The supposed alternative hypothetical argument seems to throw much light upon them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall any teach God knowledge?</span> Job has been searching the "deep things of God," speculating upon the method of the Divine government of the world, he has perhaps rashly ventured to "rush in where angels fear to tread." Now, however, he cheeks himself with the confession that God's ways are inscrutable, his knowledge far beyond any knowledge possessed by man. Men must not presume to judge him; it is for him to judge them. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he judgeth those that are high</span>. None so exalted, none so advanced in wisdom and knowledge, none so venturesome in sounding depths that they cannot fathom, but God is above them, judges them, knows their hearts, and, according to his infallible wisdom, condemns or approves them. This is a chastening thought, and its effect on Job is to make him contract his sails, and, leaving the empyrean, content himself with s lower flight. Previously he has maintained, as if he were admitted to the Divine counsels, that the prosperity of the wicked was a rule of God's government. Now he goes no further than to say that there is no rule discoverable. Happiness and misery are dispensed - as far as man can see - on no definite principle, and, at the end, one lot happens to all: all go down into the tomb, and lie in the dust, and the worms devour them (vers. 23-26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Can anyone teach</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;lam&#183;me&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3925.htm">Strong's 3925: </a> </span><span class="str2">To exercise in, learn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">knowledge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1847.htm">Strong's 1847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Knowledge</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hal&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">since He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">judges</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;p&#333;&#183;w&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8199.htm">Strong's 8199: </a> </span><span class="str2">To judge, pronounce sentence, to vindicate, punish, to govern, to litigate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those on high?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7311.htm">Strong's 7311: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be high actively, to rise, raise</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/21-22.htm">OT Poetry: Job 21:22 Shall any teach God knowledge seeing he (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/21-21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 21:21"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 21:21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/21-23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 21:23"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 21:23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
