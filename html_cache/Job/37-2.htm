In the context of Job, Elihu is speaking, urging Job and his friends to recognize God's sovereignty. Thunder is often associated with God's voice in Scripture, symbolizing His authority and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-4</a>). The imagery of thunder also connects to the theophany at Mount Sinai, where God's voice was accompanied by thunder and lightning (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). This serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the reverence due to Him.<p><b>and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.</b><br>The rumbling signifies the continuous and overwhelming power of God's communication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, natural phenomena like storms were often seen as manifestations of divine activity. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of God as the Creator who controls the elements (<a href="/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27-33</a>). The rumbling can also be seen as a metaphor for God's judgments and decrees, which are unstoppable and all-encompassing. This echoes the prophetic literature where God's voice is described as shaking the earth (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>). The phrase invites reflection on the power of God's word, which is living and active (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), and foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering his perspective on Job's suffering and God's majesty.
