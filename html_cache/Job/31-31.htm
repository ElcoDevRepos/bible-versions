In ancient Near Eastern culture, the household was a central unit, and the head of the house was responsible for the well-being of all its members. Job's integrity is so well-known that even those who serve him can attest to his character. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>, where a leader must manage his own household well. Job's life serves as a type of Christ, who also was known for His impeccable character and care for those around Him.<p><b>&#8216;Who is there who has not had his fill?&#8217;&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates Job's generosity and provision for those in his care. In the context of the ancient world, hospitality and provision were highly valued virtues. Job's question implies that he has been so generous that no one in his household has ever lacked anything. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." Job's actions prefigure Christ's provision for His people, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>), where Jesus ensures that all are satisfied.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
