In the context of Job, Bildad is suggesting that Job's children were responsible for their own actions and that their suffering was a direct result of their sin. This aligns with the Deuteronomic principle of retribution, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience or disobedience to God (Deuteronomy 28). The idea of children bearing consequences for their actions is also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, which emphasizes individual responsibility for sin.<p><b>He gave them over to their rebellion</b><br>The phrase "gave them over" suggests a judicial handing over to the consequences of one's actions, a concept found in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God gives people over to their sinful desires as a form of judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God allows individuals to experience the natural outcomes of their rebellion as a means of correction or judgment. The term "rebellion" indicates a willful turning away from God's commands, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the narratives of Israel's history (e.g., <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>). This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the justice of God in allowing the consequences of sin to unfold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>- A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Sin is an inborn condition (<a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>) and inevitably expresses itself in actions.<p>&#8226; Bildad assumes the children&#8217;s death was a direct consequence of their sin. While his theology is too rigid (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>), the text still affirms that sin has consequences (<a href="/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against Him</b><p>&#8226; All sin is ultimately directed &#8220;against Him&#8221;&#8212;God Himself. David confessed, &#8220;Against You, You only, I have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal offenses hurt others, yet first and foremost violate God&#8217;s holy standard (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Bildad&#8217;s statement underscores divine sovereignty: God is the offended party who alone has authority to respond (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He gave them over</b><p>&#8226; The phrase mirrors <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>: &#8220;Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts.&#8221; It conveys judicial release&#8212;God allows sinners to experience the fruit of their choices (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not divine indifference but righteous judgment. By stepping back, God lets consequences teach what warnings did not (<a href="/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Job had regularly interceded for his children (<a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>), showing the value of parental prayer. Bildad implies God&#8217;s restraint can be lifted when sin persists (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To their rebellion</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rebellion&#8221; highlights willful defiance, not accidental failure (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Persistent rebellion hardens the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>) and invites God&#8217;s disciplinary hand (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Bildad infers that calamity befell Job&#8217;s children because they reached a point of hardened resistance. Whether or not that was accurate in their case, Scripture affirms that rebellion ultimately reaps judgment (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/8-4.htm">Job 8:4</a> captures Bildad&#8217;s theology: sin has consequences because it offends a holy God, who may withdraw protection and let rebels face the results of their choices. While Bildad misapplies this to Job&#8217;s situation, the verse remains a sober reminder that sin&#8212;aimed against God&#8212;invites divine judgment when hearts persist in rebellion, and that only repentance and God&#8217;s mercy can break that sequence (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10-12</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And he have cast them away.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">then he sent them away. </span>By means of their transgression; it became their destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thy children have sinned against him</span>.
