It reflects the skepticism and challenge towards Job's claims of innocence and understanding of his suffering. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, wisdom was highly valued, and elders were often seen as the primary holders of knowledge. Eliphaz's question implies that Job, despite his suffering, cannot possess knowledge beyond what is already known by the wise men of his time. This reflects a common theme in the Book of Job, where human understanding is limited compared to God's omniscience. The rhetorical nature of the question suggests that Eliphaz believes Job's assertions are unfounded. This connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, which emphasize the vast difference between human and divine understanding.<p><b>What do you understand that is not clear to us?</b><br>This phrase continues the challenge to Job's claims of understanding his plight. It underscores the belief that Job's friends hold&#8212;that they, as a collective, possess a comprehensive understanding of God's ways and justice. Historically, this reflects the communal approach to wisdom in ancient societies, where knowledge was shared and validated within a group rather than through individual insight. Theologically, this question points to the limitations of human wisdom and the mystery of divine providence, a central theme in the Book of Job. It also foreshadows the eventual revelation that God's wisdom and plans are beyond human comprehension, as seen in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God speaks directly to Job, highlighting the limitations of human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Yet Job has already professed trust in God&#8217;s justice despite not grasping the reason for his pain (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The friends assume clarity comes only through their traditional theology: righteousness yields blessing, sin brings calamity (cf. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). They therefore conclude that Job must lack understanding&#8212;or be hiding sin.<p>&#8226; Other passages highlight that true understanding begins with the fear of the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and that God sometimes keeps His purposes veiled (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz&#8217;s challenge inadvertently foreshadows God&#8217;s later questions to Job&#8212;&#8220;Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>)&#8212;revealing that ultimate clarity rests with the Creator, not with man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9</a> records Eliphaz&#8217;s double-barreled challenge, exposing the friends&#8217; confidence in human tradition and their suspicion of anything outside their rigid formula. While Scripture faithfully captures Eliphaz&#8217;s words, the larger narrative will prove his assumptions inadequate. The verse reminds believers to approach suffering and mystery with humility, recognizing that all genuine knowledge and understanding come from the LORD, who alone sees the full picture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What knowest thou, that we know not?</span> So far as worldly wisdom went, this was probably quite true. Job was not more advanced in knowledge than Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. But he had a keener spiritual insight. He was wiser in the "wisdom which is from above." Perplexed and confused as were his thoughts concerning the Divine government of the universe, they were nearer the truth, more worthy of the Divine nature, than those of his adversaries. In his reply, without claiming any special wisdom, he pours contempt on their pretensions to spiritual understanding (<a href="/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What understandest thou, which is not in us?</span> A mere repetition of the first member of the verse in different words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do you know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that we do not?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">What do you understand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1437;&#1489;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_995.htm">Strong's 995: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate mentally, understand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">clear to us?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/15-9.htm">OT Poetry: Job 15:9 What do you know that we don't (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/15-8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 15:8"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 15:8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/15-10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 15:10"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 15:10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
