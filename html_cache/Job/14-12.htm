In the book of Job, death is often depicted as a sleep from which there is no awakening, emphasizing the permanence of the grave. This aligns with the cultural understanding of Sheol, the abode of the dead, where individuals are cut off from the living. The imagery of lying down suggests rest, yet it is a rest that lacks the hope of resurrection, contrasting with later biblical revelations of life after death. This phrase can be compared to other Old Testament passages such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>, which speaks of the dead knowing nothing, highlighting the cessation of earthly life and activity.<p><b>Until the heavens are no more,</b><br>This expression indicates an indefinite period, suggesting the permanence of death until a cosmic change occurs. The heavens being "no more" implies a cataclysmic event, possibly alluding to the end of the world or a divine intervention that alters the current order. This can be connected to prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>, where the heavens are described as being rolled up or dissolved, symbolizing the end times. The phrase underscores the belief that only a significant divine act could reverse the state of death.<p><b>he will not be awakened</b><br>The concept of awakening from death is a theme that finds fuller development in later biblical texts. In the context of Job, there is a sense of hopelessness regarding resurrection, as the prevailing belief was that death was a one-way journey. However, this notion of awakening foreshadows New Testament teachings on resurrection, where Christ is described as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). The idea of awakening also resonates with <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, which speaks of many who sleep in the dust of the earth awakening to everlasting life.<p><b>or roused from sleep.</b><br>The metaphor of sleep for death is common in biblical literature, emphasizing the temporary nature of death from a divine perspective. While Job expresses a lack of hope for resurrection, this imagery is later transformed in the New Testament, where believers are assured of being roused from the sleep of death through Christ's resurrection power. Passages such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14-16</a> provide assurance that those who have died in Christ will be raised at His coming. This transformation of the sleep metaphor highlights the progressive revelation of God's redemptive plan throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.

Yet the verse also plants a seed of hope&#8212;death&#8217;s reign is temporary. When God dissolves the present heavens and ushers in a new creation, He will awaken every sleeper. The passage therefore calls us to face death realistically, trust the promise of resurrection, and live now in light of the coming day when Christ&#8217;s voice breaks the silence of every grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So man lieth down, and riseth not</span>. This is not an absolute denial of a <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, since Job is speaking of the world as it lies before him, not of eventualities. Just as he sees the land encroach upon the sea, and remain land, and the river-courses, once dried up, remain dry, so he sees men descend into the grave and remain there, without rising up again. This is the established order of nature as it exists before his eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake</span>. This order of things, Job believes, rightly enough, will continue as long as the heavens and the earth endure. What will happen afterwards he does not so much as inquire. It is remarked, ingeniously, that Job's words, though not intended in this sense, exactly "coincide with the declarations of the New Testament, which make the resurrection simultaneous with the breaking up of the visible universe" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Nor be raised out of their sleep</span>. If "the glimmer of a hope" of the resurrection appears anywhere in vers. 10-12, it is in the comparison of death to a sleep, which is inseparably connected in our minds with an awakening. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/14-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">so man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
