Smiling at someone in ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of favor and approval. Job's smile would have been seen as a blessing or endorsement, indicating his high status and the esteem in which he was held by his community. This respect is reminiscent of the honor given to patriarchs like Abraham and leaders like Moses, who were seen as intermediaries of God's favor.<p><b>they did not believe it</b><br>This suggests that Job's favor was so significant that it was almost unbelievable to those who received it. It highlights the profound impact of his presence and approval. In a broader biblical context, this disbelief can be compared to the reaction of people to divine favor or miracles, such as when the Israelites doubted God's provision in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). It underscores the human tendency to doubt even when faced with clear signs of blessing.<p><b>the light of my countenance</b><br>The "light of my countenance" is a metaphor for the joy, approval, and favor that Job's presence brought to others. Biblically, light is often associated with God's presence and blessing, as seen in the Aaronic blessing: "The LORD make His face shine upon you" (<a href="/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>). This phrase indicates that Job's presence was a source of encouragement and hope, much like the presence of God is to His people.<p><b>was precious</b><br>The term "precious" denotes something of great value and rarity. Job's favor and presence were highly esteemed, much like wisdom is described in Proverbs as more precious than rubies (<a href="/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>). This reflects the cultural and historical context where leaders and elders were revered, and their approval was sought after. It also points to the idea of Christ, whose presence and favor are of ultimate value to believers, as He is the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
