The phrase emphasizes the totality of Job's trials and the comprehensive nature of his suffering. It highlights the severity of his situation, which serves as a backdrop for his response. The phrase underscores the completeness of the testing Job undergoes, reminiscent of the trials faced by other biblical figures such as Joseph and Daniel, who also maintained their integrity under pressure.<p><b>Job did not sin</b><br>Job's response to his suffering is characterized by his refusal to sin, which is significant given the cultural and religious expectations of his time. In the ancient Near Eastern context, suffering was often seen as a result of personal sin or divine displeasure. Job's steadfastness in maintaining his righteousness despite his circumstances is a testament to his character and faith. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of righteousness and integrity, as seen in figures like Noah and Abraham, who were also described as blameless in their generations.<p><b>or charge God with wrongdoing</b><br>Job's refusal to accuse God of injustice is a profound statement of faith and trust in God's sovereignty. In the historical and cultural context of the ancient Near East, where polytheistic beliefs often attributed capricious behavior to deities, Job's monotheistic faith stands out. This phrase highlights the theological theme of God's justice and righteousness, which is explored throughout the book of Job. It also foreshadows the New Testament portrayal of Jesus Christ, who, despite suffering unjustly, did not revile or accuse God, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>. Job's response serves as a model of patient endurance and trust in God's ultimate goodness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man from the land of Uz, described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s &#8220;all this&#8221; includes the sudden loss of his livestock, servants, and children (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that trials often come in clusters, not single events&#8212;<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a> likewise assumes &#8220;various trials.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Even while grieving, Job&#8217;s first response was worship: &#8220;The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that faith is proven genuine in adversity (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32-36</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording affirms that every hardship Job faced fell under God&#8217;s sovereign oversight (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Job did not sin</b><p>&#8226; Despite unbearable loss, Job refused to transgress with his lips or actions; he maintained the blameless character described in <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>.<p>&#8226; His restraint mirrors Joseph&#8217;s resolve when tempted by Potiphar&#8217;s wife: &#8220;How then could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a> assures believers that God provides a way to endure temptation; Job illustrates that promise.<p>&#8226; The verse does not claim Job was sinless in life, but that he did not sin in this circumstance&#8212;similar to David&#8217;s testimony in <a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s example invites us to guard our hearts in crisis (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>) and rely on the Spirit&#8217;s power to resist bitterness (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or charge God</b><p>&#8226;

Job lives out that verse by refusing to argue that God treated him unfairly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a> likens complaining against God to clay disputing with the potter; Job instead submitted to divine wisdom.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-38</a> teaches that both calamity and blessing pass through God&#8217;s hand; recognizing this truth kept Job from resentment.<p>&#8226; By not charging God, Job models reverent trust even when the &#8220;why&#8221; remains hidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With wrongdoing</b><p>&#8226; Scripture affirms repeatedly that God is righteous in all His ways (<a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p>&#8226; To accuse God would imply moral failure on His part, contradicting His perfect nature (<a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s restraint underscores the principle found in <a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;The judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In trials we often judge circumstances before the Lord&#8217;s purpose is revealed (<a href="/john/13-7.htm">John 13:7</a>). Job teaches patience until God&#8217;s wisdom becomes clear (<a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Trusting God&#8217;s character guards the heart against cynicism and keeps worship genuine (<a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a> spotlights a man surrounded by grief who still chose holiness over rebellion, reverence over accusation. Every calamity he faced was met with unwavering faith in God&#8217;s goodness. The verse calls believers to mirror that posture: accept God&#8217;s sovereignty &#8220;in all this,&#8221; refuse to sin when wounded, never lay blame on the Almighty, and rest in His flawless righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Foolishly.</span>--The same word as at <a href="/job/24-12.htm" title="Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God lays not folly to them.">Job 24:12</a>, signifying reproach or guilt.
