In the context of Job, God is responding to Job's earlier complaints and questions about justice and suffering. The question implies that no one has ever given anything to God that would obligate Him to repay. This reflects the biblical theme of God's independence and the idea that all things originate from Him (<a href="/romans/11-35.htm">Romans 11:35</a>). It also highlights the futility of human attempts to bargain with or manipulate God, as seen in the broader narrative of Job's friends and their flawed theology.<p><b>Everything under heaven is Mine.</b><br>This phrase asserts God's ownership and dominion over all creation. It echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God is depicted as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The statement reinforces the idea that God is the ultimate authority and possessor of all things, a theme also found in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it." This ownership implies that God has the right to govern and direct the universe according to His will. It also points to the concept of stewardship, where humans are caretakers of God's creation, accountable to Him for how they manage it. In a Christological sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate authority, as He is described in the New Testament as having all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

God resists any and every claim that is made on him to justify himself and his doings to a creature. He is not a debtor to any. If he explains himself to any extent, if he condescends to give an account of any of his doings, it is of pure grace and favour. It has been observed that we might have expected this to be the conclusion of the entire discourse begun in ch. 38; and that no doubt would have been, according to ordinary laws of human composition, its more proper place. But Hebrew poetry is erratic, and pays little regard to logical lawn If anything important has been omitted in its more proper place, it is inserted in one which is, humanly speaking, less proper.
