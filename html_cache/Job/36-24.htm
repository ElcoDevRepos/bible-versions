In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is urging Job and his friends to acknowledge God's greatness and sovereignty. The term "magnify" suggests not only recognition but also an active proclamation of God's power and majesty. This aligns with the biblical theme of glorifying God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, "Magnify the LORD with me; let us exalt His name together." The act of magnifying God's work is a form of worship and acknowledgment of His divine authority and creative power, which is evident throughout creation and history.<p><b>which men have praised in song</b><br>This phrase highlights the tradition of using music and song to celebrate God's deeds. Throughout the Bible, music is a significant means of worship and expression of faith. The Psalms, for instance, are filled with songs of praise that recount God's mighty works and faithfulness. In <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, the Song of Moses and Miriam celebrates God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. This tradition continued into the New Testament, where hymns and spiritual songs are encouraged as a form of teaching and admonishing one another (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). The use of song to praise God underscores the communal and enduring nature of worship, as it transcends generations and cultures, uniting believers in a shared expression of faith and reverence for God's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and majesty.
