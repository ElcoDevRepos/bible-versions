The comparison to a cedar, a tree known for its size and strength, suggests a creature of immense power and majesty. In biblical times, cedars, particularly those from Lebanon, were highly valued for their durability and were used in the construction of significant structures, such as Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). The imagery of a swaying cedar conveys not only the size but also the grace and strength of the Behemoth. This description has led some to speculate that the Behemoth could be a now-extinct creature or a poetic representation of a known animal, such as a hippopotamus or an elephant, though these animals do not have tails resembling cedars. Theologically, this imagery emphasizes God's creation's grandeur and the limitations of human understanding in comprehending His works.<p><b>the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.</b><br>This phrase highlights the strength and muscular build of the Behemoth, indicating a creature of great physical power. The sinews, or tendons, being "tightly knit" suggests a robust and well-structured anatomy, capable of supporting the creature's massive frame. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical strength was often associated with divine favor or blessing, and the Behemoth's formidable build serves as a testament to God's creative power. This description can be seen as a reminder of the order and intentionality in God's creation, contrasting with the chaos and disorder that humans often experience. Theologically, it underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the idea that His creation, in its complexity and strength, reflects His glory and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
