Bulls and rams were common sacrificial animals in ancient Near Eastern cultures, representing wealth and atonement. This specific instruction underscores the seriousness of the atonement required for the friends' transgressions.<p><b>go to My servant Job</b><br>Referring to Job as "My servant" highlights his restored relationship with God and his role as an intercessor. This title is significant, as it is used for other key figures in the Bible, such as Moses and David, indicating a position of honor and divine favor.<p><b>and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central part of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The act of sacrifice was a tangible expression of repentance and a plea for forgiveness, emphasizing the need for the friends to seek reconciliation with God through prescribed means.<p><b>Then My servant Job will pray for you</b><br>Job's role as an intercessor prefigures Christ's mediatory work. Just as Job prays for his friends, Jesus intercedes for believers. This act also demonstrates the power of righteous prayer, as seen in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, which states that the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.<p><b>for I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly</b><br>God's acceptance of Job's prayer highlights His mercy and willingness to forgive. The term "folly" refers to the friends' misguided theology and accusations against Job. This phrase underscores the importance of correct understanding and representation of God's character.<p><b>For you have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.&#8221;</b><br>This rebuke emphasizes the importance of speaking truthfully about God. The friends' error was in their simplistic understanding of suffering and retribution. Job, despite his struggles, ultimately maintained a more accurate view of God's sovereignty and justice, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's inscrutable wisdom and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This is probably one indication out of many that the age of Job was that of Moses, or before it. "My servant Job shall pray for you." This, strange to say, was the very promise with which Eliphaz himself had closed his third and last speech. His words therefore received a striking fulfilment in the case of himself and his friends. The intercession of Job seems to show us that his character is a typical one, representing to us the character of Christ as the sufferer and the mediator on behalf of man; and as in Job there is no trace of acquaintance with the Divine covenant, the book shows us a sort of anticipation of the Gospel to the Gentile world, that the mercies of God are not limited, as some have thought, to the chosen race, but that the principles of God's action are the same universally. He deals with men upon a principle of mediation: whether the mediator be Moses, as the mediator of the first covenant; or Job, who was the accepted mediator for his friends beyond the pale of the covenant; or whether the mediator be Jesus Christ, as the one Mediator between God and man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams</span>.
