The Bible frequently emphasizes the importance of caring for orphans and widows (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Job's assertion here is part of his defense of his righteousness, indicating that he has not committed such an injustice. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, the fatherless were often without protection or legal standing, making them easy targets for exploitation. Job's claim reflects the biblical principle of justice and mercy, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p><b>because I saw that I had support in the gate</b><br>The "gate" refers to the city gate, which was the place where legal matters were settled and where elders and leaders of the community gathered (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>, <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). Having "support in the gate" implies having influence or backing from the community leaders, which could be used to one's advantage in legal disputes. Job is asserting that he did not exploit his social standing or influence to harm the fatherless. This reflects the biblical call to use one's power and influence for justice and righteousness, rather than for personal gain (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The mention of the gate also highlights the importance of integrity and fairness in public and legal matters, a theme that resonates throughout the wisdom literature of the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
