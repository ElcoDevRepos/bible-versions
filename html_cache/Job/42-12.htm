The concept of God blessing the latter days more than the former is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's ability to restore and multiply blessings beyond previous states (see <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>, <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>). Job's restoration serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and justice, affirming that enduring faith and righteousness are ultimately rewarded. This also prefigures the ultimate restoration and blessing found in Christ, who brings eternal life and restoration to those who believe.<p><b>He owned 14,000 sheep,</b><br>Sheep were a significant measure of wealth in ancient times, used for wool, meat, and sacrificial offerings. The doubling of Job's sheep from 7,000 to 14,000 signifies not only material prosperity but also God's abundant provision. This increase reflects the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>, where the blessing of the Lord brings wealth without painful toil. The sheep also symbolize the flock of believers, with Christ as the Good Shepherd, indicating spiritual abundance and care.<p><b>6,000 camels,</b><br>Camels were valuable for trade and transportation, especially in the arid regions of the Near East. The doubling of camels from 3,000 to 6,000 underscores Job's restored status and influence in the community, as camels were essential for long-distance trade routes. This increase can be seen as a metaphor for the expansion of influence and the spreading of God's blessings, akin to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where believers are called to spread the gospel to all nations.<p><b>1,000 yoke of oxen,</b><br>A yoke of oxen, typically two animals, was crucial for plowing fields and agricultural productivity. The increase from 500 to 1,000 yoke signifies a doubling of Job's capacity for cultivation and harvest, symbolizing fruitfulness and divine favor. This abundance can be linked to the biblical principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, where faithful labor in God's service yields a bountiful harvest.<p><b>and 1,000 female donkeys.</b><br>Female donkeys were prized for their ability to bear offspring and provide milk, contributing to the sustainability and growth of a household's wealth. The doubling from 500 to 1,000 female donkeys highlights the theme of multiplication and prosperity. In a broader sense, this increase can be seen as a type of the church, which is called to be fruitful and multiply spiritually, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, where the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and loss, yet remained faithful to God.

It in no way pledged God to compensate worldly adversity by worldly prosperity in the case of any other sufferer; and certainly the general law seems to be that such earthly compensation is withheld. But, in combination with the instinct which demands that retributive justice shall prevail universally, it may be taken as an earnest of God's ultimate dealings with men, and a sure indication that, if not on earth, at least in the future state; each man shall receive "the deeds done in the body," according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. <span class="cmt_word">For he had</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and he had</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses</span>.
