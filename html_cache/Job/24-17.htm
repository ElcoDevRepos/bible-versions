In biblical context, darkness often symbolizes evil, ignorance, and judgment (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The imagery here reflects the moral corruption of those who thrive in sin, as they find comfort and opportunity in darkness rather than light. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual blindness, where the wicked are unable to perceive the truth and righteousness that light represents (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>).<p><b>surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the close association between the wicked and the fearsome aspects of darkness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, night was a time of danger and uncertainty, filled with threats from both natural and supernatural forces. The "terrors of darkness" could refer to both literal dangers, such as thieves and wild animals, and spiritual threats, such as demonic forces (<a href="/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5-6</a>). The phrase suggests that the wicked are not only unafraid of these terrors but are allied with them, indicating a deep-seated alignment with evil. This can be contrasted with the protection and peace promised to the righteous, who walk in the light of God's presence (<a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1

Mean</div><b>For to them</b><p>- Job has just cataloged how the wicked steal, oppress, and murder under cover of night (<a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>- &#8220;Them&#8221; therefore points to people who reject God&#8217;s light and choose a path of sin (compare <a href="/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently distinguishes between &#8220;children of light&#8221; and those who &#8220;walk in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>; <a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>). Job is describing the latter group.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>deep darkness</b><p>- &#8220;Deep darkness&#8221; is not ordinary nightfall; it is the pitch-black gloom that conceals all sight (see <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21&#8211;23</a> for a physical picture of such darkness).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> says, &#8220;The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.&#8221;<p>- Spiritually, this darkness symbolizes separation from God&#8217;s truth (<a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>). The wicked are at home in that realm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is their morning</b><p>- Morning normally signals hope, work, and worship (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>). For these people, the very opposite is true: the darker it gets, the more alive they become.<p>- Jesus exposes the same reality: &#8220;People loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>).<p>- The inversion shows how sin twists everything. What God designed for rest (night) becomes their peak activity period.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>surely they are friends</b><p>- &#8220;Friends&#8221; implies familiarity and fondness. These individuals don&#8217;t merely dabble in darkness; they welcome it, defend it, and depend on it.<p>- <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a> asks, &#8220;Can two walk together unless they are agreed?&#8221; Their alliance with evil proves agreement with it.<p>- <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a> portrays the same mindset: approving and encouraging what God condemns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the terrors of darkness!</b><p>- Darkness in Scripture often carries fearful connotations&#8212;uncertainty, danger, judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65&#8211;67</a>).<p>- Ironically, the wicked cozy up to what should terrify them. <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> warns against calling evil good and good evil; that is exactly what is happening here.<p>- Yet <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11&#8211;12</a> reminds believers that even darkness is as light to God; He sees, He judges, and ultimately no secret deed will stay hidden (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a> paints a stark portrait of the wicked: they are so committed to sin that the darkest hours feel like dawn, and the very horrors that ought to frighten them have become their companions. The verse warns that when people embrace sin, their values invert&#8212;night becomes day, fear becomes friendship&#8212;yet God remains fully aware and will bring every work into His perfect light.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death</span>. They hate the morning light. It is associated in their minds with the idea of detection; for when it breaks in upon them unexpectedly in the midst of their ill deeds, detection commonly follows; and detection is a true "shadow of death," for it commonly means the gallows. If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death; rather, <span class="accented">for they know the terrors of the shadow of death</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> the Revised Version).
