In the context of Job, it refers to the wicked who indulge in their desires and accumulate wealth without regard for righteousness. Biblically, this imagery is often used to depict those who trust in their own resources rather than in God (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19-20</a>). The stomach being full symbolizes a temporary state of contentment that precedes divine judgment.<p><b>God will vent His fury upon him</b><br>This indicates the certainty of divine retribution. The concept of God's fury is consistent with the Old Testament portrayal of God's justice against sin (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>). It reflects the belief that God is not indifferent to evil and will act to uphold His righteousness. Theologically, it underscores the principle that God's patience with the wicked has limits, and His justice will ultimately prevail.<p><b>raining it down on him as he eats</b><br>The imagery of rain suggests an overwhelming and inescapable judgment. In biblical literature, rain can symbolize both blessing and judgment, depending on the context (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14-17</a>). Here, it conveys the sudden and comprehensive nature of God's wrath. The phrase "as he eats" emphasizes the unexpected timing of judgment, reminiscent of the suddenness of the flood in Noah's time (<a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38-39</a>). This serves as a warning that divine justice can interrupt human complacency at any moment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Scripture often warns that earthly fullness without God is deceptive; <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> reminds us &#8220;there is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Zophar, the speaker in <a href="/bsb/job/20.htm">Job 20</a>, is stressing that even when the ungodly reach peak prosperity, they stand on the brink of disaster (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will vent His fury upon him</b><p>Immediately after satisfaction comes divine intervention: &#8220;God will vent His fury upon him.&#8221;<p>&#8226;
