In the context of the Book of Job, Job has been lamenting his suffering and questioning God's justice. This reflects a broader biblical theme where humans often struggle to understand God's ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The cultural context of the Ancient Near East often involved questioning deities, but the Hebrew tradition emphasized trust in God's wisdom and sovereignty.<p><b>that He answers nothing</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the perceived silence of God in response to human questioning. Throughout the Bible, there are instances where God seems silent, such as in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>) and during the intertestamental period. This silence can be a test of faith or a call to deeper trust. Theologically, it suggests that God's ways and timing are beyond human understanding, and His silence does not equate to absence or indifference.<p><b>a man asks?</b><br>The phrase underscores the human perspective in seeking answers from God. It reflects the limited understanding of humanity compared to divine wisdom. In the broader biblical narrative, God often answers in unexpected ways or through His actions rather than direct responses (Job 38-41). This can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, the ultimate answer to human suffering and sin, came in a manner that was unexpected by many (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>). The historical context of Job, set in a patriarchal society, emphasizes the humility required in approaching God with questions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

Earlier Job had said, &#8220;Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>). Honest lament is biblical (<a href="/psalms/142-1.htm">Psalm 142:1&#8211;2</a>), yet complaining that indicts God crosses a line.<p>&#8226; Complaint often grows from forgetting God&#8217;s sovereign goodness (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; It narrows vision to present pain and ignores past mercy (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; It overlooks that &#8220;The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p>When hearts drift to grumbling, James warns, &#8220;Do not complain, brothers, so that you will not be judged&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a>). Elihu lovingly redirects Job to worshipful trust instead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He answers nothing</b><p>Job felt heaven&#8217;s silence, yet Elihu insists God is not mute: &#8220;For God speaks once, and twice, yet no one perceives it&#8221; (<a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8212;&#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Creation&#8212;&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Conscience&#8212;God&#8217;s law is &#8220;written on their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Providence&#8212;He weaves circumstances for good (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8212;&#8220;He will guide you into all truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Wise counsel&#8212;&#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p>Perceived silence often signals dull ears, not a silent God. Even David cried, &#8220;I cry out by day, and You do not answer&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>), yet later confessed, &#8220;He has not hidden His face&#8230;He has listened&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-24.htm">Psalm 22:24</a>).

Job was striving with and against the darkness that was round about His throne, not with the justice of God, which he entirely trusted.
