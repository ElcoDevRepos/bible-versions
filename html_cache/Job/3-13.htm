In the context of the ancient Near Eastern culture, lying down in peace often symbolized death, which was seen as a release from the troubles of life. Job's lament here is not a wish for death itself but for the peace that he believes death would bring. This longing for peace can be connected to the biblical theme of rest found in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, where God rests on the seventh day, and in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of a Sabbath rest for the people of God. Job's expression of wanting to lie down in peace also foreshadows the ultimate peace and rest found in Christ, who offers rest for the weary (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>I would be asleep</b><br>In the biblical context, sleep is often used as a metaphor for death (<a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-15</a>). Job's use of the term "asleep" suggests a state of unconsciousness and inactivity, contrasting with his current state of turmoil and suffering. This metaphorical use of sleep indicates a temporary state, implying hope for awakening or resurrection, which is a theme developed more fully in the New Testament. The idea of sleep as a peaceful state also reflects the cultural understanding of death as a time when one is free from the struggles and pains of earthly life.<p><b>and at rest.</b><br>Rest, in the biblical sense, often signifies a cessation from labor and struggle, as seen in the concept of the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). For Job, rest would mean an end to his intense physical and emotional suffering. This longing for rest can be seen as a type of the ultimate rest promised to believers in the eschatological hope of eternal life with God, where there will be no more pain or suffering (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The rest Job seeks is a precursor to the rest offered by Jesus, who provides spiritual rest and peace to those who trust in Him (<a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
