Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as a protector and deliverer of the needy, as seen in Psalms 72:12-14, where He is described as rescuing the poor and needy. This reflects God's character as compassionate and just, ensuring that those who cannot defend themselves are cared for.<p><b>from the sword in their mouth</b><br>The "sword in their mouth" can be understood metaphorically, referring to harmful words or accusations that can destroy reputations or lives. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, words were powerful and could be used as weapons. This phrase may also connect to the idea of false testimony or slander, which is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The imagery of a sword suggests the destructive potential of speech, a theme echoed in <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, where the tongue is described as a fire.<p><b>and from the clutches of the powerful</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's ability to deliver the needy from those who wield power unjustly. In the historical context, the powerful often exploited the weak, a situation addressed by the prophets who called for justice and righteousness (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). The "clutches" imply a grip or control, suggesting that the powerful may oppress or manipulate the needy. This deliverance is a type of Christ's work, who came to set the oppressed free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>) and who stands against the forces of injustice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>- A man of great faith and patience, who endures immense suffering and loss.
