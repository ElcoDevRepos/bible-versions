The term "persecute" suggests a relentless pursuit or harassment, which Job feels from both his friends and, in his perception, from God. This reflects Job's deep anguish and confusion about his suffering. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, suffering was often seen as a direct result of divine displeasure, which is why Job's friends insist he must have sinned. Job's comparison of his friends' actions to God's indicates his feeling of being unjustly targeted. This echoes the broader theme of the book, where Job struggles to understand the reason for his suffering. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of divine testing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>, where God tests Abraham.<p><b>Will you never get enough of my flesh?</b><br>Here, "flesh" symbolizes Job's physical and emotional being, which has been ravaged by his afflictions. The phrase suggests a sense of being consumed or devoured, highlighting the intensity of his suffering. In the historical context, physical suffering was often seen as a manifestation of spiritual or moral failure, which is why Job's friends believe he must have sinned. The imagery of consuming flesh can also be seen in <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, where enemies are described as seeking to devour the psalmist's flesh. This phrase underscores the relentless nature of Job's trials and the insatiable nature of his friends' accusations. In a typological sense, Job's suffering and feeling of being consumed can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own suffering and the way He was metaphorically "devoured" by the sins of the world, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Instead of comforting, they intensify his misery (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns against compounding a brother&#8217;s affliction: &#8220;They persecute him whom You have struck&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-26.htm">Psalm 69:26</a>). Job&#8217;s friends ignore that warning, presuming insight into divine purposes they do not possess (<a href="/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking the question, Job insists that human comforters must show mercy, not mimic what they believe to be God&#8217;s disciplinary hand (<a href="/proverbs/19-22.htm">Proverbs 19:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will you never get enough of my flesh?</b><p>Job pictures his friends as predators who have already consumed much of him yet still crave more.<p>&#8226; He has lost possessions, children, and health (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13&#8211;19</a>; 2:7), and now feels stripped of dignity by their relentless words (<a href="/job/19-9.htm">Job 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Flesh&#8221; recalls the boils covering his body (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>) and the scabs he scrapes with broken pottery (<a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>). Their verbal assault feels like another round of tearing at what little is left.<p>&#8226; Scripture condemns such exploitation of the wounded: &#8220;You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>). Paul later calls believers to &#8220;bear one another&#8217;s burdens&#8221; instead (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s vivid language anticipates Christ, of whom the psalmist says, &#8220;All my bones are on display; people stare and gloat over me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>). Just as Job&#8217;s suffering pointed beyond itself, so his friends&#8217; cruelty foreshadows those who would mock the Man of Sorrows (<a href="/matthew/27-41.htm">Matthew 27:41&#8211;43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a> exposes the cruelty of friends who, instead of offering compassion, align themselves with what they assume is God&#8217;s judgment. Job&#8217;s twin questions highlight the danger of presuming divine insight, the callousness of piling reproach on the afflicted, and the deep need for mercy in human relationships. Scripture consistently affirms that God alone has the right to discipline, while His people are charged to comfort, restore, and uphold those in pain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Why do ye persecute me as God?</span>--Comp. <a href="/job/16-9.htm" title="He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.">Job 16:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why do ye persecute me as God?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Why are ye as hard on me as God himself?
