In the context of the Book of Job, Job is in the midst of intense suffering and is seeking answers from God. This longing to find God is a common theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, where the psalmist expresses a thirst for God. Theologically, this reflects the human condition of seeking divine presence and understanding, a theme that resonates with the idea of God being both transcendent and immanent. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern context often depicted gods as distant, yet Job's yearning suggests a personal relationship with the divine, which is a distinctive feature of the Hebrew faith.<p><b>so that I could go to His seat</b><br>The "seat" here refers to a place of judgment or authority, akin to a throne. In ancient cultures, a king's seat was where he rendered judgments and decrees. Job's desire to approach God's seat indicates his wish to present his case before God, seeking justice and vindication. This imagery is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as a righteous judge, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>. Theologically, this foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the ultimate judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), who invites believers to approach the throne of grace with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The concept of God's seat also connects to the mercy seat in the tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt, symbolizing both judgment and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

God seems to be very far removed from us. He is in heaven, and we are on earth; nay, he is in the highest heaven, or outside it, walking on its circumference (<a href="/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>). How are we to approach near to him, so near as to be sure that he can hear us? How are we to "find" him? So, in all ages, has the human heart gone out to God, aspiring towards him, seeking after him, but, for the most part, baffled and disappointed. Job, like most other men in the olden times, though he has faith in God, though he serves him and prays to him, has yet the feeling that he is remote, distant, well-nigh inaccessible. It needed revelation to let man know that God is not far off, but very near to each one of us; that "in him we live, and move, and have our being" (<a href="/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might come even to his seat!</span> Job's idea of bridging the distance between himself and God is that he should rise to the region where God is, not that God should condescend to come down to him.
