In the Old Testament, the presence of God is often associated with blessing and protection, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Job's lament here echoes the covenantal relationship God had with Israel, where His presence was a sign of His favor and guidance (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament promise of God's abiding presence through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). Job's longing for the Almighty's presence also prefigures the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity in the person of Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and my children were around me</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial blessings Job enjoyed before his suffering. In the ancient Near Eastern context, having children was considered a sign of divine blessing and favor (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). Job's children being around him signifies not only the joy and pride of parenthood but also the social and economic stability that a large family provided in that era. The loss of his children was one of the most profound aspects of Job's suffering, emphasizing the depth of his trials. This loss can be compared to the grief experienced by other biblical figures, such as Jacob mourning Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34-35</a>). The restoration of Job's fortunes, including the blessing of more children at the end of the book (<a href="/job/42-13.htm">Job 42:13</a>), serves as a testament to God's restorative power and foreshadows the ultimate restoration and reconciliation found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil. He is the central figure in the Book of Job, known for his immense suffering and unwavering faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_almighty.htm">The Almighty (Shaddai)</a></b><br>A name for God emphasizing His power and sovereignty. In Hebrew, "Shaddai" conveys the idea of God as the all-powerful one who provides and protects.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_children.htm">Job's Children</a></b><br>Job had ten children, seven sons and three daughters, who were part of his life before his trials began. Their presence in Job's life is a symbol of blessing and prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel.

Job&#8217;s memory echoes that assurance of divine partnership.<p>&#8226; Protection experienced: &#8220;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). Job once lived in this confidence before calamity struck.<p>&#8226; Provision recognized: &#8220;The young lions suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>). Job&#8217;s former prosperity flowed from trusting that the Almighty actively cared for him.<p>&#8226; Peace known: &#8220;You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast mind, because he trusts in You&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). Job remembers the inward rest that accompanies felt fellowship with God.<p>&#8226; Promise contrasted: <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a> affirms, &#8220;Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you,&#8221; yet Job&#8217;s lament shows how pain can cloud, though not cancel, that reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my children were around me</b><p>Job&#8217;s memory turns to the joy of family fellowship that once filled his home.<p>&#8226; Blessing of offspring: &#8220;Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). Job treasured his sons and daughters as gifts directly from God.<p>&#8226; Picture of abundance: &#8220;Your children will be like olive shoots around your table&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>).

The verse highlights how the loss of either&#8212;sense of God&#8217;s nearness or loved ones&#8212;can deepen suffering. Yet the broader testimony of Scripture affirms that God&#8217;s presence is constant and His power to restore remains, offering hope to all who, like Job, cling to Him amidst affliction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the Almighty was yet with me</span>.
