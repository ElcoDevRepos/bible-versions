The term "blessed" indicates a state of happiness and divine favor, suggesting that Job was seen as someone who was in right standing with God and thus prospered. This reflects the cultural belief in retributive justice, where righteousness leads to blessing. Job's status as a respected elder in his community is evident here, as he was a man of influence and integrity. This respect is reminiscent of the blessings pronounced in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where those who are righteous are called blessed. Job's experience can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was called blessed by those who recognized His divine mission (<a href="/luke/1-42.htm">Luke 1:42</a>).<p><b>and those who saw me commended me</b><br>This phrase highlights the public acknowledgment of Job's character and deeds. To be commended means to be praised or approved, indicating that Job's actions were in line with societal and divine expectations. In the ancient Near Eastern context, public reputation was crucial, and Job's commendation by others underscores his role as a community leader and a man of wisdom. This public recognition is similar to the way Jesus was commended by those who witnessed His miracles and teachings (<a href="/mark/7-37.htm">Mark 7:37</a>). Job's life serves as a foreshadowing of the ultimate commendation of Christ, who was affirmed by God the Father at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
