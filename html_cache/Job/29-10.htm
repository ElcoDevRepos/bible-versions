The "nobles" refer to the leaders and influential figures of the community. In ancient Near Eastern culture, these individuals held significant power and authority. Job's presence and wisdom commanded such respect that even these high-ranking individuals would fall silent. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>, where a righteous person's ways can cause even their enemies to be at peace with them. Job's righteousness and integrity were so evident that it commanded the respect and attention of the most powerful.<p><b>and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.</b><br>This vivid imagery emphasizes the profound silence and awe that Job's wisdom and presence inspired. In the ancient world, the tongue sticking to the roof of the mouth was a metaphor for being speechless or unable to respond, often due to reverence or fear. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a>, where the psalmist speaks of the tongue sticking to the roof of the mouth as a sign of deep emotional response. In Job's case, it underscores the respect and authority he once held, which is a type of Christ, who also commanded silence and awe through His wisdom and authority, as seen in <a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>, where people were amazed at His teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, known for his patience and faithfulness amidst severe trials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nobles.htm">Nobles</a></b><br>Influential and respected leaders in society who, in this context, are rendered silent in the presence of Job's wisdom and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel, though its exact location is uncertain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_past_prosperity.htm">Job's Past Prosperity</a></b><br>This chapter reflects on a time when Job was respected and honored, contrasting with his current suffering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_wisdom.htm">Divine Wisdom</a></b><br>The underlying theme of divine wisdom and justice, as Job reflects on his past influence and the respect he commanded.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_godly_wisdom.htm">The Power of Godly Wisdom</a></b><br>Job's wisdom and integrity commanded respect, demonstrating the power of living a life aligned with God's principles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_earned_through_righteous_living.htm">Respect Earned Through Righteous Living</a></b><br>Job's past respect from the nobles was a result of his righteous and just actions, encouraging believers to live in a way that earns respect from others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humility_of_the_wise.htm">The Humility of the Wise</a></b><br>The nobles' silence before Job's wisdom teaches the importance of humility and the willingness to listen and learn from those who are wise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_past_blessings.htm">Reflecting on Past Blessings</a></b><br>Job's reflection on his past prosperity can encourage believers to remember and be grateful for God's blessings, even in times of trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_a_godly_life.htm">The Influence of a Godly Life</a></b><br>Job's life serves as a reminder of the influence a godly life can have on others, inspiring believers to be a positive influence in their communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_29_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 29:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_29_10_Job_s_community_influence.htm">How does Job 29:10 reflect Job's influence and leadership in his community?

Respect was not demanded; it was granted because they recognized God&#8217;s wisdom flowing through him, echoing <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, &#8220;For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were hushed</b><p>Their immediate silence shows reverence. <a href="/job/29-9.htm">Job 29:9</a> states, &#8220;the princes refrained from speaking.&#8221; Such restraint mirrors <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>, &#8220;the LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him,&#8221; and reminds us of <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where stillness positions God&#8217;s people to witness His work.
