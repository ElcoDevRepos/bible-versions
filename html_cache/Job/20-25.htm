In the context of Job, Zophar is describing the fate of the wicked, implying that their punishment is both inevitable and severe. The imagery of a weapon being drawn from the back indicates a surprise attack or betrayal, which aligns with the biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Historically, arrows were common in warfare, and their removal was a painful process, emphasizing the suffering of the wicked.<p><b>the gleaming point from his liver</b><br>The liver was considered the seat of life and emotions in ancient cultures, including the Hebrew context. The "gleaming point" suggests a sharp, deadly weapon, possibly a metaphor for divine judgment. The liver's mention highlights the depth of the wound, both physically and spiritually. In biblical symbolism, the liver's damage signifies a fatal blow, indicating the totality of the wicked's downfall. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>, where God&#8217;s judgment is depicted as a sharp sword.<p><b>Terrors come over him</b><br>This phrase captures the psychological and spiritual consequences of sin, as the wicked are overwhelmed by fear and dread. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, fear was often associated with divine retribution. The terrors can be seen as both internal guilt and external threats, reflecting the comprehensive nature of divine judgment. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/10-24.htm">Proverbs 10:24</a>, which states that what the wicked dread will overtake them. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the final judgment, where unrepentant sinners face eternal separation from God, contrasting with the peace promised to the righteous.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Just as an archer&#8217;s shaft finds its target, so divine retribution never misses (see <a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12-13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Pulling the weapon out does not heal; it only exposes the mortal wound. Zophar is emphasizing that the wicked cannot escape the consequences of their sin (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;your sin will find you out&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The back is the part the victim cannot protect, showing vulnerability when God&#8217;s judgment strikes from a direction the sinner never expected (<a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, &#8220;Your arrows have sunk deep into me&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the gleaming point from his liver</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues: &#8220;the gleaming point from his liver.&#8221; The liver, in ancient thought, is the seat of life and vitality. A pierced liver means certain death.<p>&#8226; Removing the &#8220;gleaming point&#8221; (the polished, shining metal tip) makes the fatal damage visible. So the wicked person&#8217;s inner corruption is laid bare before everyone&#8212;no hidden sin remains concealed (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links fatal wounds to the liver when speaking of sin&#8217;s consequences. <a href="/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a> pictures a young man struck &#8220;till an arrow pierces his liver,&#8221; and <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a> speaks of deep grief &#8220;my liver is poured on the ground.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The brightness of the point highlights God&#8217;s righteous justice: His judgments are never murky or unfair; they shine with perfect clarity (<a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Terrors come over him</b><p>&#8226; Once the weapon is removed and the mortal injury exposed, &#8220;Terrors come over him.&#8221; Physical pain and imminent death usher in overwhelming dread.<p>&#8226; Zophar stresses that internal fear accompanies external judgment. When God&#8217;s wrath breaks out, panic overwhelms the conscience of the ungodly (<a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-24.htm">Proverbs 10:24</a>).<p>&#8226; In life the wicked may boast, but in the moment of reckoning, all courage evaporates (<a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6-8</a>). No human defense or wealth can silence the terrors God sends (<a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6-7, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; These terrors hint at eternal consequences. Earthly anguish foreshadows the everlasting fear awaiting those who die apart from God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/20-25.htm">Job 20:25</a> delivers a sobering, literal snapshot of divine judgment: a weapon removed from the wicked man&#8217;s back, its bright tip pulled from his very liver, followed by waves of terror. Each phrase reinforces the certainty, severity, and unveiling nature of God&#8217;s justice. Hidden sin is struck, exposed, and paid for; the sinner&#8217;s false security crumbles into dread. The verse stands as a vivid warning&#8212;and an urgent invitation&#8212;to seek the righteousness and refuge that only the Lord provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Yea, terrors overtake him.</span>--Even when he has escaped a second and a third calamity, terrors shall still be upon him.
