The "sounds of terror" symbolize the constant anxiety and dread that accompany those who live in opposition to God's ways. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, auditory imagery was often used to convey psychological states. The idea of terror filling one's ears suggests an overwhelming sense of impending doom, which aligns with the biblical theme that the wicked cannot escape the consequences of their actions (<a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>). This phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative that peace and security are found in righteousness and obedience to God (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>).<p><b>in his prosperity</b><br>The mention of "prosperity" highlights the temporary and deceptive nature of the wicked's success. In the historical context of the Old Testament, prosperity was often seen as a sign of divine favor. However, Eliphaz argues that even in times of apparent success, the wicked are not truly secure. This reflects the biblical principle that material wealth and success are fleeting and cannot provide true peace or security (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>). The prosperity of the wicked is often contrasted with the enduring blessings of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3-4</a>).<p><b>the destroyer attacks him.</b><br>The "destroyer" can be understood as a representation of divine judgment or calamity that befalls the wicked. In the biblical context, the term "destroyer" is sometimes used to describe agents of God's judgment, such as the angel of death in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. This phrase underscores the inevitability of divine retribution for those who live in defiance of God's laws. The imagery of an attack during prosperity serves as a warning that no amount of wealth or success can shield one from the consequences of sin. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God's justice will ultimately prevail, and the wicked will face destruction (<a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

How suddenly they are destroyed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly pairs earthly success with looming judgment for those who ignore God. <a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a> notes, &#8220;The triumph of the wicked is short.&#8221; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a> adds, &#8220;While people are saying, &#8216;Peace and security,&#8217; destruction will come upon them suddenly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;The destroyer&#8221; can refer to any agent God allows&#8212;calamity, enemy invasion, or death itself. In <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a> the same title describes the angel who struck Egypt; here it signals inevitable divine reckoning.<p>&#8226; Prosperity is no armor when hearts remain proud. <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a> pictures disaster &#8220;sweeping like a whirlwind&#8221; precisely when the complacent least expect it.<p>&#8226; Eliphaz means this as a direct accusation against Job, but the broader biblical witness confirms the warning: comfort without godliness invites catastrophe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21</a> portrays the grim reality that sin breeds torment within and judgment without. Even while a person seems secure, unaddressed rebellion fills the mind with dread and opens the door for sudden destruction. Though Eliphaz misapplies the verse to Job, the principle stands: true peace and safety flow only from humble, obedient trust in the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A dreadful sound is in his ears</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a sound of terrors.</span> Fears of all kinds beset him, lest he should lose his prosperity.
