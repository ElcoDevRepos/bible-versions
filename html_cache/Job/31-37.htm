This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of legal proceedings where individuals would present their case before a judge. Job's confidence in his integrity is evident, as he believes he can justify his actions. Biblically, this mirrors the idea of living a life that is transparent before God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>, where the psalmist invites God to search and know his heart. The concept of giving an account is also echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where believers are reminded that each person will give an account of themselves to God.<p><b>I would approach Him like a prince.</b><br>Job's assertion that he would approach God "like a prince" indicates his sense of dignity and confidence in his righteousness. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, a prince would have had the right to enter the presence of a king with a certain level of respect and authority. This imagery suggests that Job feels justified in his actions and believes he has the right to stand before God without fear. Theologically, this can be connected to the New Testament teaching of believers having boldness to approach God through Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are encouraged to approach the throne of grace with confidence. This phrase also foreshadows the believer's position in Christ, who is described as the "Prince of Peace" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, and through whom believers are made co-heirs with Christ, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
