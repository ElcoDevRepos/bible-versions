In biblical literature, trees often represent life, growth, and stability (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). The imagery of hope in a tree suggests a natural cycle of life and restoration, contrasting with human mortality. The use of "hope" here is significant, as it reflects a theme throughout Scripture where hope is often tied to faith in God's promises (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>).<p><b>If it is cut down:</b><br>The cutting down of a tree can symbolize destruction or judgment, akin to the fall of nations or individuals who turn away from God (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>). However, the context here implies a temporary setback rather than a permanent end. This reflects the biblical theme of redemption and restoration, where what seems lost can be renewed by divine intervention (<a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>).<p><b>It will sprout again:</b><br>The ability of a tree to sprout again after being cut down highlights the theme of resurrection and new beginnings. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though crucified, rose again, bringing new life to believers (<a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>). The resilience of the tree mirrors the hope of resurrection and eternal life promised to those who trust in God (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><b>And its tender shoots will not fail:</b><br>The tender shoots represent new growth and the continuation of life. This imagery is consistent with the biblical promise of God's faithfulness and the assurance that His purposes will prevail (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>). The unfailing nature of the shoots can also be seen as a metaphor for the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people, as seen in the promises made to Abraham and fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the nature of human existence and divine justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel, possibly in Edom or northern Arabia.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_suffering.htm">Job's Suffering</a></b><br>The context of Job's lament in chapter 14, where he reflects on the brevity and difficulty of life, using the metaphor of a tree to express hope amidst despair.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>Just as a tree can sprout again after being cut down, believers can find hope in God's power to restore and renew, even in the midst of trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resilience_in_faith.htm">Resilience in Faith</a></b><br>The imagery of a tree's resilience encourages believers to remain steadfast in faith, trusting that God can bring new life and growth from seemingly hopeless situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>This verse reminds us of God's sovereignty and providence, assuring us that He is capable of bringing about renewal and redemption in His perfect timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_through_trials.htm">Endurance through Trials</a></b><br>Job's reflection teaches us the importance of enduring through life's challenges, holding onto the hope that God will ultimately bring restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_new_beginnings.htm">Symbol of New Beginnings</a></b><br>The sprouting tree serves as a symbol of new beginnings, encouraging believers to look forward to the new life and opportunities God provides.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_14_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 14:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_14_7_Hope_in_hopelessness.htm">How does Job 14:7 illustrate hope in seemingly hopeless situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_tree_symbolize_today.htm">What does the "tree" symbolize in Job 14:7 for believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Job_14_7_Persevere_in_trials.htm">How can Job 14:7 encourage perseverance during personal trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Job_14_7_with_Isaiah_40_31.htm">Connect Job 14:7 with another Bible verse about renewal or restoration.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_hope_for_a_tree_daily.htm">How can we apply the concept of "hope for a tree" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Job_14_7_Hope_and_renewal_in_despair.htm">What does Job 14:7 suggest about hope and renewal in the face of despair?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Job_14_7_s_link_to_resurrection_theme.htm">How does Job 14:7 relate to the theme of resurrection in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Job_14_7.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Job 14:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_appear_silent_or_absent.htm">Why does God appear silent or absent?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_jesus_currently_living.htm">How does delayed hope affect one's emotional state?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_job_14_14_doubt_resurrection.htm">Does Job 14:14&#8217;s question &#8220;If someone dies, will they live again?&#8221; indicate uncertainty about resurrection, challenging other parts of the Bible that teach it?

A tree looks dead when a lumberjack fells it, yet hope remains hidden in the roots. Scripture repeatedly links hope with God&#8217;s sustaining power (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>). In context, Job feels crushed by suffering, but he still recognizes, even if only intellectually, that God has built hope into creation itself (<a href="/psalms/31-24.htm">Psalm 31:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Creation testifies to God&#8217;s pattern of renewal (<a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of hope, even in nature, points to the Author of hope (<a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If it is cut down,</b><p>The axe represents severe loss&#8212;exactly what Job has endured. Yet the stump remains. God often prunes to bring greater fruitfulness (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>). Believers may experience sharp setbacks, but God never abandons the root (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Trials may &#8220;cut down&#8221; our plans, health, or security, but not our relationship with the Lord (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; What seems final to us is only partial from God&#8217;s viewpoint (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will sprout again,</b><p>Job observes that new shoots push through the soil, proving life was still inside. Scripture shows God reviving what looked finished:<p>&#8226; Israel returning from exile (<a href="/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Jairus&#8217;s daughter raised (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; Most supremely, Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>).<p>These examples reinforce that God delights in restoring what appeared beyond recovery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its tender shoots will not fail.</b><p>Fresh growth starts fragile but carries divine assurance. God guards the new life He plants (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). Job&#8217;s statement anticipates the certainty of resurrection&#8212;truth later affirmed clearly (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Tender shoots&#8221; hint that early stages of renewal may look weak, yet God guarantees completion (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise underscores steadfastness: what God revives, He sustains (<a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a> pictures a felled tree reviving from its roots, illustrating God-given hope amid apparent ruin. Though life&#8217;s blows may cut us down, the Creator implants resilience and the promise of restoration. In Christ, that hope extends beyond present trials to ultimate resurrection, assuring that what God brings to life He will never allow to fail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3426.htm">Strong's 3426: </a> </span><span class="str2">Being, substance, existence, is</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hope</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1451;&#1511;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tiq&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8615.htm">Strong's 8615: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cord, expectancy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a tree:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1431;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
