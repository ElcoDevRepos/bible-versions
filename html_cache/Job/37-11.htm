In the ancient Near Eastern context, rain was crucial for agriculture and survival, making God's provision through rain a sign of His care and power. The imagery of God loading clouds with moisture can be seen as a metaphor for His ability to provide abundantly. This aligns with other biblical passages that depict God as the provider of rain, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, where God promises rain for the land in its season. Theologically, this reflects God's ongoing involvement in creation, sustaining it through His divine will.<p><b>He scatters His lightning through them.</b><br>Lightning in the Bible often symbolizes God's power and presence. In <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, lightning accompanies God's descent on Mount Sinai, signifying His majesty and authority. The scattering of lightning can also be seen as a demonstration of God's judgment, as in <a href="/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a>, where lightning is used as a weapon against enemies. This phrase underscores the idea that God is not only the creator but also the ruler who actively governs the natural world. The unpredictability and power of lightning serve as a reminder of God's might and the awe He inspires. In a broader theological sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as coming with power and great glory, as in <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>, where His return is likened to lightning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's majesty and justice.

If He commands lightning, should He not also oversee the events of Job&#8217;s life?<p>&#8226; At the same time, lightning within rain clouds shows that God&#8217;s nurture and His awe-inspiring might travel together&#8212;mercy wrapped in majesty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a> paints a vivid, literal picture of the Lord&#8217;s mastery over weather: He packs the clouds with water to sustain the earth and flings lightning to display His unrivaled power. Elihu&#8217;s point to Job&#8212;and to us&#8212;is simple: the God who balances life-giving rain with fearsome flashes is fully capable of balancing comfort and trial in our lives. Recognizing that sovereignty invites trust, worship, and humble submission to the One who loads the clouds and lights up the sky.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) He <span class= "bld">wearieth the thick cloud.</span>--Also He ladeth the thick cloud with moisture, maketh it to be charged with rain. "He scattereth the cloud of His lightning," that is, which containeth His lightning. Others render, "Yea, the bright sun weareth out (disperseth) the thick cloud; it scattereth the cloud that holds His lightning. And it (the cloud) is turned round about by His counsels, that they may do His purpose, even all which He commandeth them, upon the face of the habitable world." Whether for correction, or for His land generally, or whether He causeth the rain to come as a special mercy:--these are the various purposes for which God reserves His showers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud</span>; rather, <span class="accented">also with moisture he ladeth the thick cloud.</span> Elihu returns from his description of the winter season to the more ordinary condition of things. Rain is the chief necessity of Eastern countries; and God is ever providing it, causing moisture to be drawn up from earth and sea, and safely lodged in the clouds, whence it descends, as needed, and as commanded by God, upon the fields and plains that man cultivates. <span class="cmt_word">He scattereth his bright cloud</span>. Most commentators see a reference to lightning here; and it is possible, no doubt, that such a reference is intended. "His bright cloud" - literally, "the cloud of his light" - may mean "the cloud in which his lightning is stored." But perhaps no more is meant than that God spreads abroad over the earth the clouds on which his sunlight rests. The genial showers of spring fall generally from clouds that are, in part at any rate, steeped in the sun's rays. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/37-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He loads</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1496;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7789;&#183;r&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2959.htm">Strong's 2959: </a> </span><span class="str2">To toil, be burdened</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the clouds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5645.htm">Strong's 5645: </a> </span><span class="str2">An envelope, darkness, a, cloud, a copse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with moisture;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7377.htm">Strong's 7377: </a> </span><span class="str2">Irrigation, a shower</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He scatters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1437;&#1508;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6327.htm">Strong's 6327: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be dispersed or scattered</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His lightning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_216.htm">Strong's 216: </a> </span><span class="str2">Illumination, luminary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">through them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;nan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6051.htm">Strong's 6051: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cloud, the nimbus, thunder-cloud</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/37-11.htm">OT Poetry: Job 37:11 Yes he loads the thick cloud (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/37-10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 37:10"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 37:10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/37-12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 37:12"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 37:12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
