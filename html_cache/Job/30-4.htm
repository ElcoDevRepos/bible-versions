Mallow is a plant that grows in arid regions and is often associated with poverty and survival. In biblical times, it was not considered a desirable food source, indicating the dire circumstances of those who consumed it. The act of plucking mallow among the shrubs suggests a scavenging lifestyle, highlighting the theme of suffering and degradation. This imagery connects to the broader context of Job's lament about his fallen state and the reversal of fortunes. The use of wild plants for food can also be seen in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>, where wild gourds are gathered during a famine.<p><b>and the roots of the broom tree were their food</b><br>The broom tree, known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in desert conditions, provides a stark image of survival in harsh environments. Its roots, though not typically consumed, are mentioned here as a last resort for nourishment. This reflects the extreme poverty and desperation faced by those who rely on such sources for sustenance. The broom tree is also mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>, where Elijah rests under it, symbolizing a place of refuge and desolation. The consumption of its roots underscores the theme of suffering and the lengths to which people will go to survive. This imagery serves as a metaphor for Job's own experience of loss and hardship, as he identifies with those who are marginalized and destitute.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
