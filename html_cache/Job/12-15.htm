In biblical context, water often symbolizes chaos and disorder, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The ability to hold back waters signifies divine authority over creation, reminiscent of God's control during the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). This act of holding back waters can also be seen as a metaphor for God's restraint of judgment or chaos, aligning with His role as a protector and sustainer.<p><b>they dry up,</b><br>The drying up of waters can symbolize desolation and judgment. In the historical context of the Ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, essential for life and agriculture. The drying up of water sources would lead to drought and famine, seen as a divine judgment or curse, as in the case of Elijah's prophecy of drought in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>. This phrase underscores the dependence of creation on God's provision and the consequences when He withholds it.<p><b>and if He releases them,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's ability to unleash the waters, symbolizing His power to bring about abundance or destruction. The release of waters can be seen in the context of the Flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>, where God opens the floodgates of heaven, resulting in a deluge that covers the earth. It serves as a reminder of God's capacity to execute judgment but also to provide, as seen in the blessings of rain for a fruitful harvest.<p><b>they overwhelm the land.</b><br>The overwhelming of the land by waters signifies destruction and chaos, akin to the Flood in Noah's time. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to depict God's judgment, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>, where the Assyrian invasion is likened to a flood overwhelming the land. It also serves as a type of Christ, who calms the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, demonstrating His authority over the natural world and His role as the one who brings peace and order out of chaos. This phrase ultimately points to the dual nature of God's power to both judge and save.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering. He is known for his dialogues with his friends and his unwavering trust in God despite his circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator and Sustainer of the universe, who is in control of all natural and supernatural events. In this verse, God's power over nature is emphasized.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/waters.htm">Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of both life and chaos in the Bible. In the context of <a href="/job/12-15.htm">Job 12:15</a>, waters represent God's control over creation, whether in withholding rain or causing floods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/land.htm">Land</a></b><br>Represents the earth and its inhabitants, who are subject to God's sovereign will and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are part of the larger account.

But, beside this great occasion, he also in ten thousand other cases, causes, by means of floods, tremendous ruin and devastation, sweeping away crops and cattle, and even villages and cities, sometimes even "overturning the earth," causing lakes to burst, rivers to change their course, vast tracts of land to be permanently submerged, and the contour of coasts to be altered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
