In the ancient Near East, iron was considered a strong and valuable metal, used for weapons and tools. The comparison to straw, a material easily broken and of little worth, emphasizes Leviathan's power and the futility of human efforts to subdue it. This imagery underscores the theme of God's unmatched power and the limitations of human strength, as seen throughout the book of Job. The metaphor also reflects the cultural understanding of iron as a symbol of strength, which is rendered insignificant in the face of Leviathan.<p><b>and bronze as rotten wood</b><br>Bronze, like iron, was a significant metal in ancient times, used for armor and weaponry. The comparison to rotten wood, which is weak and decayed, further illustrates the creature's dominance over human technology and defenses. This imagery serves to remind readers of the futility of relying on human strength and wisdom in the face of divine creation. The use of bronze in this context may also connect to other biblical passages where bronze symbolizes judgment or strength, such as in the construction of the Tabernacle and Temple. The depiction of Leviathan's indifference to bronze reinforces the message of God's sovereignty and the need for humility before His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
