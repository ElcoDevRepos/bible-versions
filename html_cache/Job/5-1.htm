In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking to Job, suggesting that his cries for help may go unanswered if directed towards anyone other than God. This highlights the belief in the sovereignty and uniqueness of God as the ultimate source of help and wisdom. The rhetorical question implies the futility of seeking aid from other spiritual entities, emphasizing the monotheistic belief that only God can truly respond to human distress. This can be connected to passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>, where God invites people to turn to Him for salvation, underscoring His role as the sole responder to human needs.<p><b>To which of the holy ones will you turn?</b><br>The "holy ones" likely refer to angelic beings or celestial figures considered to be part of the divine council. In the ancient Near Eastern context, there was a belief in a pantheon of gods or divine beings, but the Hebrew Scriptures consistently affirm the supremacy of Yahweh over any other spiritual entities. This phrase challenges the notion of turning to intermediaries instead of directly to God. It reflects the cultural and religious milieu of the time, where people might have been tempted to seek the favor of lesser deities or spiritual beings. Theologically, this aligns with the biblical teaching that God alone is the source of wisdom and help, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>, which emphasizes looking to the Lord for assistance. This also prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the sole mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), reinforcing the idea that turning to any other "holy ones" is unnecessary and ineffective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

While Eliphaz intends to warn Job that unseen sin blocks divine help, the broader biblical witness assures us that God listens to the upright, responds to humble repentance, and offers direct access through His Son. The verse thus contrasts human misjudgment with God&#8217;s faithful readiness to hear and rescue those who truly trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">V.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Call now.--</span>The speaker now becomes more personal and direct in his tone and bearing.

The anticipation is in remarkable accordance with the ultimate event (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>), and shows that Eliphaz, if not a prophet in the higher sense, is at least a sagacious interpreter of God's ways with men, and can very happily forecast the future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">call now</span>; <span class="accented">is there any that will answer thee?</span> What aid, that is, wilt thou invoke, if thou turnest away from God, and reproachest him?

The question, "To <span class="accented">which</span> wilt thou turn?" seems to imply that there was already in Job's time some knowledge of individual members of the angelic host, such as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, etc., though we have no mention of any names of angels in Scripture until the time of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).
