In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is speaking about God's ability to see and judge the actions of people. The idea that God recognizes deeds is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, which speaks of God's intimate knowledge of human actions and thoughts. This reflects the biblical theme that nothing is hidden from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in divine justice, where God is aware of both righteous and wicked actions and will respond accordingly.<p><b>He overthrows them in the night</b><br>The imagery of God acting "in the night" suggests suddenness and unexpectedness, as night often symbolizes a time of vulnerability and lack of awareness. This can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where God acts decisively during the night. The phrase also implies divine intervention that is beyond human control or prediction. Historically, night raids or attacks were common in ancient warfare, making this imagery relatable to the original audience. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereign power to disrupt human plans and execute judgment.<p><b>and they are crushed.</b><br>The term "crushed" conveys total defeat and destruction, often used in the context of divine judgment. This reflects the ultimate consequence of opposing God's will, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, where God promises to break the rebellious with a rod of iron. Theologically, it points to the finality of God's judgment against the wicked, aligning with eschatological themes found in Revelation. The crushing of the wicked can also be seen as a type of Christ's victory over sin and evil, where through His death and resurrection, He defeats the powers of darkness (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and sovereignty.

Because this is true, &#8220;therefore&#8221; signals a settled conclusion: God&#8217;s next move is always grounded in flawless knowledge. Like <a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>, &#8220;The LORD looks down from heaven&#8230;He forms the hearts of all; He considers all their works.&#8221; We can rest in the certainty that nothing escapes His sight, whether treachery in high places or faithfulness in hidden corners.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He recognizes their deeds</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s assessment is personal&#8212;&#8220;He recognizes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It is comprehensive&#8212;&#8220;their deeds&#8221; includes motives and actions, public and private (<a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>, <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; His recognition is moral, not merely observational. He weighs each act against His own righteous standard (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4-5</a>).<p>This exposes the folly of secret sin and underscores the comfort of being known by a righteous Judge. As <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a> reminds us, &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He overthrows them in the night</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Overthrows&#8221; pictures decisive, inescapable judgment, echoing the sudden fall of Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13, 24</a>-25).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the night&#8221; highlights the element of surprise; the proud assume safety under cover of darkness, yet darkness is as light to God (<a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing underscores mercy as well: God&#8217;s patience delays judgment, but when it comes, it is swift (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3, 6</a>).<p>This serves as both warning and reassurance&#8212;evil will not prevail indefinitely, and believers need not engineer vengeance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they are crushed</b><p>The result is final: the wicked are &#8220;crushed,&#8221; unable to rebuild their rebellion (<a href="/job/34-24.htm">Job 34:24</a>, <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-38</a>).
