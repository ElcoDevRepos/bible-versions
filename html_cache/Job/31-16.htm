In the ancient Near Eastern context, the poor were often marginalized and lacked social support. The Mosaic Law emphasized care for the poor (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), reflecting God's heart for justice and mercy. Job's statement aligns with the biblical principle of generosity and compassion, seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which states that kindness to the poor is akin to lending to the Lord. This phrase also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the least of these (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><b>or allowed the widow&#8217;s eyes to fail</b><br>Widows in ancient times were particularly vulnerable, often lacking financial support and protection. The "eyes to fail" metaphorically describes the despair and hopelessness that can result from neglect. Scripture consistently calls for the protection and provision for widows (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Job's claim of not allowing the widow's eyes to fail highlights his commitment to justice and mercy, reflecting God's character. This concern for widows is echoed in the New Testament, where the early church is instructed to care for widows (<a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3-16</a>), demonstrating continuity in God's concern for the vulnerable throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The duty of relieving the poor, solemnly enjoined upon the people of Israel in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), was generally admitted by the civilized nations of antiquity. In Egypt it was especially insisted on. "The Egyptian's duties to mankind," says Dr. Birch, "were comprised in giving bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, oil to the wounded, and burial to the dead" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 46). <span class="cmt_word">Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail</span>.
