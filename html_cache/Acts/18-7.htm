This action reflects a pattern seen throughout Acts, where Paul initially preaches to the Jews and then turns to the Gentiles when faced with rejection (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>). The synagogue was a central place for Jewish worship and community life, and leaving it indicates a shift in focus towards a broader audience. This decision aligns with Jesus' instruction to His disciples to shake the dust off their feet when not welcomed (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>).<p><b>and went next door</b><br>The proximity of Titus Justus's house to the synagogue is significant. It suggests that Paul did not abandon his mission to the Jews entirely but rather positioned himself strategically to continue reaching out to them. This move also symbolizes the transition of the early Christian movement from Jewish roots to a more inclusive community. The physical closeness underscores the spiritual continuity and the hope that some Jews might still come to faith.<p><b>to the house of Titus Justus</b><br>Titus Justus, also known as Titius Justus in some manuscripts, is identified as a Gentile who worships the God of Israel. His Roman name indicates his Gentile background, and his willingness to host Paul highlights the openness of some Gentiles to the Gospel. This hospitality reflects the early church's reliance on the generosity of believers for meeting spaces, as seen in other New Testament accounts (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>).<p><b>a worshiper of God</b><br>The term "worshiper of God" or "God-fearer" refers to Gentiles who were attracted to Judaism and its monotheistic beliefs but had not fully converted, often due to cultural or social barriers like circumcision. These individuals played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity, as they were familiar with Jewish teachings and more receptive to the message of Jesus as the Messiah. Cornelius, the centurion in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, is another example of a God-fearer who embraced the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul was an apostle who spread the Gospel to the Gentiles.

Verse 6 records fierce opposition at Corinth, so he literally shakes out his garments and steps away.

It may be added here that it occurs also in early Christian inscriptions in the Vatican Museum, in one case at the bottom of a glass cup, in the <span class= "ital">Museo Christiano, </span>in conjunction with the name of Timotheus. In some of the better MSS. the name Titus is prefixed to Justus, and it will be noted that both in <a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>, and <a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>, the latter is used as an epithet after the names of Joseph and of Jesus. It is found by itself in the Jewish cemetery above referred to. (See Note on <a href="/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a>.) It would be rash to infer from this the identity of this Titus Justus with the Titus of <a href="/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>, as the disciple left in Crete. The name Titus was, like Gaius or Gains, one of the commonest Roman names, and, if the reading be genuine, we may think of the epithet as added to distinguish the Titus of Corinth from his namesake. On the other hand, to state the evidence on both sides fairly, the Titus who appears in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2Corinthians 8:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, was obviously very closely connected with the Church of Corinth, and was not unlikely to be sent to Crete to exercise a mission analogous to that which he had been entrusted with at Corinth, and the combination of the names Timotheus and Justus, above referred to, as equally entitled to reverence, is more intelligible if we assume that the latter name belonged to Titus, and that both stood therefore in the same relation to St. Paul as disciples and friends. In any case the Justus who is here named was, like Titus, an uncircumcised Gentile, attending the synagogue as a proselyte of the gate. Up to this time apparently, St. Paul had been lodging in the house of a Jew, in some region of Corinth analogous to the Ghetto of modern Rome, in the hope of conciliating his brethren according to the flesh. Now, in sight of the wild frenzied fanatics, he goes into a house which they would have shrunk from entering, even though it was next door to the synagogue, and though the man who lived in it was a devout worshipper. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Went</span> for <span class="accented">entered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the house of a certain man</span> for <span class="accented">a certain man's house</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Titus Justus</span> for <span class="accented">Justus</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Thence</span>. Clearly from the synagogue, where he had been preaching to the Jews, not from Aquila's house, as Alford and others.
