This appeal was made during his trial before Festus, the Roman governor. The context here is that Paul, facing accusations from Jewish leaders, exercised his right to have his case heard by the highest authority in the Roman Empire. This reflects the Roman legal system's structure, where citizens could appeal to the Emperor if they believed they were not receiving a fair trial. The Emperor at this time was Nero, known for his later persecution of Christians. Paul's appeal demonstrates his strategic use of his Roman citizenship to further the gospel and protect his mission.<p><b>I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar</b><br>Festus, as the Roman governor, had the authority to detain Paul until arrangements could be made for his transfer to Rome. This phrase indicates the legal process and the administrative duties of a Roman governor. The journey to Rome was significant, as it fulfilled God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). This also aligns with the broader narrative of Acts, where the gospel spreads from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth, with Rome symbolizing the heart of the known world. The mention of Caesar connects to the broader theme of the early church's interaction with Roman authority and the spread of Christianity within the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.

no lower court could override it (compare <a href="/acts/25-25.htm">Acts 25:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>- In God&#8217;s providence, this secular legal system became the vehicle to transport the gospel to the heart of the empire (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I ordered that he be held</b><p>- Festus, newly installed as governor (<a href="/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>), had to maintain Roman order, so he kept Paul in custody at Caesarea (<a href="/acts/25-4.htm">Acts 25:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- Though physically confined, Paul remained spiritually free, continuing to witness to governors, kings, and visiting dignitaries (<a href="/acts/26-1.htm">Acts 26:1&#8211;29</a>).<p>- The Lord often channels His purposes through setbacks; Paul&#8217;s imprisonment opened doors to speak before Agrippa and, ultimately, Nero&#8217;s household (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until I could send him to Caesar</b><p>- Festus needed time to prepare an official report (<a href="/acts/25-26.htm">Acts 25:26&#8211;27</a>).

By appealing to Caesar, Paul relied on his rights as a Roman citizen and on God&#8217;s prior promise. Festus&#8217;s order to keep Paul in custody and later send him to the emperor reveals how the Lord weaves earthly authority into His redemptive plan, turning prison walls into platforms for proclaiming Christ all the way to the emperor&#8217;s court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Unto the hearing of Augustus.</span>--The title is the Greek equivalent, as seen in the name Sebaste (= Augusta) given to Samaria, for the epithet which, like our "his majesty," had become a kind of official title of the Roman emperor.

It is spoken of all holy things, temples and the like, "Et queocunque sua Jupiter auget ope" (Ovid, 'Fast.,' 1:609); and, as Ovid says in the same passage, is a title proper to the gods. For, comparing it with the names of the greatest Roman families, Maximus, Magnus, Torquatus, Corvus, etc., their names, he says, bespeak human honors, but of Augustus, he says, "Hie socium summo cum Jove nomen habet." And so the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> bespeaks a veneration closely akin to adoration. <span class="cmt_word">Caesar</span>, originally the name of a family of the Juliagens, became the name of Octavius Caesar Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Caesar; then of Tiberius, as the adopted son of Augustus; and then of the successors of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who had by descent or adoption some relationship to C. Julius Caesar the great dictator. After Nero, succeeding emperors usually prefixed the name of Caesar to their other names, and placed that of Augustus after them. AElius Verus, adopted by Hadrian, was the first person who bore the name of Caesar without being emperor. From this time it became usual for the heir to the throne to bear the name; and later, for many of the emperor's kindred to be so called. It was, in fact, a title of honor conferred by the emperor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/25-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But [when]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Paul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
