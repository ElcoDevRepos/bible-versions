The synagogues were central to Jewish religious life, serving as places of worship, teaching, and community gathering. Saul's choice to begin his ministry there underscores his initial mission to the Jewish people, aligning with <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where the gospel is "first to the Jew." This setting also reflects Saul's background as a Pharisee, familiar with Jewish law and customs, making the synagogues a strategic starting point for his ministry.<p><b>declaring, &#8220;He is the Son of God.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is significant as it directly addresses the identity of Jesus, affirming His divine nature. The title "Son of God" is a messianic term rooted in Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as God's anointed king. Saul's proclamation aligns with the early church's teaching about Jesus' divinity, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-34.htm">John 1:34</a> and <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>. This bold statement would have been controversial and provocative in the synagogues, challenging traditional Jewish expectations of the Messiah and asserting Jesus' unique relationship with God.

When God saves, delay is out of place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>began to proclaim Jesus</b><p>&#8211; Paul&#8217;s first instinct is proclamation, not private reflection. Like Philip in Samaria who &#8220;proclaimed the Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>), Paul centers his message on Jesus Himself, not on abstract ideas.<p>&#8211; The focus is the Person, aligning with Paul&#8217;s later statement, &#8220;We preach Christ crucified&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>).<p>&#8211; His own dramatic conversion becomes the platform for witnessing, similar to John who writes, &#8220;what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; True faith is never silent; it overflows in words that direct others to the Savior (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the synagogues</b><p>&#8211; Paul goes first to the very places where he once hunted believers (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1&#8211;2</a>).

The tense of the verb implies that the work was continued for some length of time. What he had to proclaim was, first, that the Christ was actually and verily the Son of God no less than the Son of David; and, secondly, that Jesus of Nazareth had been shown to be the Christ. The better MSS., however, give the reading, <span class= "ital">preached Jesus.</span> The line of reasoning we may assume to have been identical with that of <a href="/context/acts/13-16.htm" title="Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience.">Acts 13:16-41</a>. It is not without interest to remember here also that the Samaritans had a synagogue of their own at Damascus, and that he may thus have preached to them, so following in the footprints of Philip and taking his first step in the great work of breaking down the barriers that divided Israel from the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">In the synagogues he proclaimed</span> Jesus for he <span class="accented">preached Christ in the synagogues</span>, A.V. and T.R.

As regards the expression <span class="cmt_word">straightway</span>, we must understand it as descriptive of Saul's action upon his return from Arabia. Is it possible that St. Luke uses it with the same meaning as he may have heard St. Paul use it in when speaking of his Damascus preaching, in the same sense as St. Paul actually does speak in <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, viz. as expressing that he did not wait for authority from the apostles, but at once, fresh from the Divine call, and having a direct commission from Christ himself, entered upon his apostolic ministry? If the Epistle to the Galatians was written A.D. , it would be just about the time that St. Luke joined St. Paul, and might be commencing to collect materials for his history. So that the phrase in the Galatians and the phrase in this twentieth verse might really be the expression of one thought committed to paper by St. Paul on the one hand, and uttered in the ear of Luke on the other. It is a confirmation of this view that in 2 Corinthians, written about the same time, there is also an account of Saul's escape from Damascus<span class="cmt_word">. In the synagogues</span>; the very synagogues (ver. 2) to which the letters of the high priest were addressed, empowering him to arrest either man or woman who called upon the Name of Jesus, and bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem to be tried before the Sanhedrim.
