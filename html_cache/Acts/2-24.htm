The resurrection is central to Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a cornerstone of apostolic preaching, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>, where Paul underscores its importance. The act of God raising Jesus signifies His approval of Jesus' sacrifice and His power over life and death, distinguishing Christianity from other beliefs.<p><b>releasing Him from the agony of death</b><br>The "agony of death" refers to the suffering and separation associated with death. In Jewish thought, death was often seen as a state of suffering and corruption. Jesus' release from this agony signifies the breaking of death's power, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, which speaks of God swallowing up death forever. This release also prefigures the future resurrection of believers, as promised in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>, where those who have died in Christ will be raised.<p><b>because it was impossible for death to keep Him in its grip</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine necessity and inevitability of the resurrection. Death could not hold Jesus because of His sinless nature and divine identity. <a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a> states that death no longer has dominion over Him, underscoring His eternal life. The impossibility of death's hold is also a testament to Jesus' fulfillment of the law and the prophets, as He is the promised Messiah who conquers death. This victory is a type of the ultimate triumph over evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, where Jesus declares He holds the keys of death and Hades.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who raised Jesus from the dead, demonstrating His power over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection is the focal point of this verse, affirming His divinity and victory over death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle delivering the sermon at Pentecost, explaining the significance of Jesus' resurrection to the gathered crowd.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pentecost.htm">Pentecost</a></b><br>The Jewish festival occurring fifty days after Passover, during which the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles, empowering them to preach the gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the backdrop for the birth of the early Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>God's ability to raise Jesus from the dead demonstrates His supreme power over all creation, including death itself.
