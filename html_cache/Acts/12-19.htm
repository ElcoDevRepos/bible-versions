This search refers to his attempt to find Peter, who had been miraculously freed from prison by an angel (<a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7-10</a>). Herod's failure to locate Peter highlights the divine intervention and protection over the apostles, emphasizing God's sovereignty over human authority.<p><b>he examined the guards and ordered that they be executed</b><br>In Roman law, if a prisoner escaped, the guards responsible could face the same penalty intended for the prisoner. This reflects the severity of Roman military discipline and the high stakes for those tasked with guarding prisoners. Herod's decision to execute the guards underscores his frustration and desire to maintain control and authority, as well as to deter any further insubordination or perceived incompetence.<p><b>Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea</b><br>Caesarea was a significant city in the Roman province of Judea, serving as the administrative center and a hub of Roman culture and power. Herod's movement from Judea to Caesarea indicates a shift from a Jewish context to a more Roman one, reflecting his dual role as a ruler trying to appease both Jewish and Roman interests. This geographical transition also sets the stage for subsequent events in Herod's life, as recorded later in <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.<p><b>and spent some time there</b><br>Herod's stay in Caesarea is historically significant, as it was during this time that he would later face his own demise (<a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20-23</a>). The phrase suggests a period of political activity and engagement with Roman officials, as Caesarea was a center of governance.

See Note on <a href="/acts/27-42.htm" title="And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.">Acts 27:42</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- Guards</span> for <span class="accented">keepers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarried there</span> for <span class="accented">there abode</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Herod</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;&#961;&#8180;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;r&#333;d&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2264.htm">Strong's 2264: </a> </span><span class="str2">Compound of heros and eidos; heroic; Herod, the name of four Jewish kings.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had searched</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(epiz&#275;t&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seek after, desire, search for, make inquiries about.
