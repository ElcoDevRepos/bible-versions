The message refers to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which Peter and John were proclaiming. The context is the aftermath of the healing of the lame man at the temple gate, which drew a large crowd and provided an opportunity for Peter to preach about Jesus' resurrection. The belief of many indicates a positive response to the gospel, showing the effectiveness of the apostles' witness and the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Holy Spirit would empower them to be His witnesses (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This belief is not merely intellectual assent but a deep, transformative faith that leads to salvation.<p><b>and the number of men grew to about five thousand</b><br>This phrase provides a numerical account of the growth of the early church. The mention of "men" specifically may indicate that the count does not include women and children, suggesting that the total number of believers could be significantly higher. This growth is remarkable considering the opposition from religious authorities and the societal challenges faced by the early Christians. The increase from the initial 3,000 converts on the day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>) to 5,000 men shows the rapid expansion of the church. This growth fulfills Jesus' parable of the mustard seed (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>), illustrating how the kingdom of God starts small but grows large.

Just as Joseph told his brothers, &#8220;You meant evil against me, but God intended it for good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>), so God turns persecution into opportunity.<p>&#8211; The word &#8220;many&#8221; underscores the breadth of God&#8217;s saving reach, echoing Jesus&#8217; promise that the kingdom would grow like a mustard seed into a tree where &#8220;the birds of the air find nests&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-18.htm">Luke 13:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who heard the message</b><p>&#8211; Faith begins with exposure to the Word: &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Peter&#8217;s sermon in Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade (<a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12-26</a>) centered on the risen Jesus&#8212;exactly what Jesus commanded in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a> and <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>.<p>&#8211; Hearing here is more than catching sound; it is attentive listening like Lydia, whose heart the Lord opened to &#8220;heed what Paul was saying&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Believed</b><p>&#8211; Belief is personal trust in the risen Christ, not mere assent to facts.

Counting men was common in that culture (cf. <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>), so the total crowd&#8212;including women and children&#8212;was likely much larger.<p>&#8211; Rapid growth highlights the Spirit&#8217;s power. In only a short span, the church had multiplied from 120 (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>) to several thousand, fulfilling <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p>&#8211; Even as leaders jailed the apostles, God was &#8220;adding to their number those who were being saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>).

As in the narrative of the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-21.htm" title="And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.">Matthew 14:21</a>), women and children were not included. The number was probably ascertained, as on that occasion, by grouping those who came to baptism and to the breaking of bread by hundreds and by fifties (<a href="/mark/6-40.htm" title="And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.">Mark 6:40</a>). The connection in which the number is given makes it probable that it represents those who, under the influence of the impression made by the healing of the cripple and by St. Peter's speech, attended the meetings of the Church that evening. The coincidence of the numbers in the two narratives could scarcely fail to lead the disciples to connect the one with the other, and to feel, as they broke the bread and blessed it, that they were also giving men the true bread from heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">howbeit</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came to be</span> for <span class="accented">was</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The number of the men</span>; strictly, of the <span class="accented">males</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a>), but probably used here more loosely of men and women.
