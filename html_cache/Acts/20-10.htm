In the context of <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, Paul is in Troas, a city in modern-day Turkey, during his third missionary journey. This journey is marked by his deep commitment to the early Christian communities, and his willingness to go down to the young man shows his concern for individuals within the church.<p><b>threw himself on the young man</b><br>This action is reminiscent of Old Testament prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who performed similar acts when raising the dead (<a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34</a>). It signifies a deep identification with the young man's plight and a reliance on God's power to restore life. This act of physical contact underscores the belief in the power of God working through His servants.<p><b>and embraced him</b><br>The embrace signifies compassion and the transmission of life. In the cultural context of the time, physical touch was a significant means of conveying care and concern. This act also symbolizes the unity and love within the Christian community, reflecting the teachings of Jesus about love and compassion.<p><b>&#8220;Do not be alarmed!&#8221; he said</b><br>Paul's words are meant to calm the gathered believers, who were likely in a state of shock and distress. This reassurance reflects the peace that comes from faith in God's power over life and death. It echoes Jesus' own words of comfort and assurance to His disciples in times of fear (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>&#8220;He is still alive!&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a testament to the miraculous power of God working through Paul. It serves as a sign of divine intervention and the truth of the resurrection, a central tenet of Christian faith.

The episode testifies to the reliability of Scripture, the continuity of God&#8217;s saving work from Old Testament prophets to New Testament apostles, and the sure hope of resurrection for all who belong to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him . . .</span>--The act reminds us of those of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm" title="And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.">1Kings 17:21</a>), and Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm" title="And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.">2Kings 4:34</a>). The close contact, the clasp of warm affection, gave a new intensity to the prayer of faith, and, as a current of vitality passed, as it were, from the one body to the other, enabled the Apostle to feel that the heart had not ceased to beat, and to give the calming assurance, "his life is in him." The whole scene is painted, as before, vividly, as by an eye-witness. We have to think of the cries of alarm, the rush of men down the staircase from the third floor with lamps and torches in their hands, the wail of sorrow on finding what looked like death, the undisturbed calmness of the Apostle, sure that his prayer was answered, and returning quietly, leaving the motionless body in the cool night air, to finish the interrupted discourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Make ye no ado</span> for <span class="accented">trouble not yourselves</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Fell on him</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and embracing him said</span>; imitating the action of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Make ye no ado</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are words especially used of the lamentations made for the dead.
