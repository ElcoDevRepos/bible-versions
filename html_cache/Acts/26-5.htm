This emphasizes the transparency and consistency of his life before his conversion. His long-standing reputation among the Jews is significant, as it establishes his credibility and the authenticity of his testimony.<p><b>and can testify, if they are willing</b><br>Paul challenges his accusers to speak the truth about his past. This implies that the Jewish leaders are aware of his former zeal and dedication to Judaism. The phrase suggests that their unwillingness to testify might be due to their reluctance to acknowledge the truth of his transformation and the implications of his message.<p><b>that I lived as a Pharisee</b><br>The Pharisees were a prominent Jewish sect known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. Paul&#8217;s identification as a Pharisee highlights his deep commitment to Jewish law and customs before his conversion. This background is crucial in understanding his initial opposition to the Christian faith and his subsequent transformation.<p><b>adhering to the strictest sect of our religion</b><br>The Pharisees were known for their rigorous observance of the Law of Moses and additional oral traditions. Paul&#8217;s statement underscores his former life of strict religious observance, which adds weight to his testimony of conversion. This strict adherence is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5-6</a>, where Paul describes his zeal for the law.<p><b>our religion</b><br>Paul refers to Judaism, the faith of the Jewish people, which is rooted in the covenantal relationship with God as revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures.

The statement underscores transparency&#8212;his past was lived in the public eye. Like <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, where Paul says, &#8220;I was brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel&#8221;, he anchors his credibility in shared history. <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13&#8211;14</a> and <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a> echo the same open record: everyone knew his zeal before Christ met him on the Damascus road.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and can testify,</b><p>Jewish authorities possessed firsthand evidence of Paul&#8217;s former life; their silence before Agrippa therefore speaks volumes. Scripture often establishes truth by the testimony of witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). Paul is effectively inviting sworn statements, confident none can deny his past devotion to Judaism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if they are willing,</b><p>The willingness clause exposes a heart issue, not a lack of information. Much like Jesus&#8217; words&#8212;&#8220;You refuse to come to Me to have life&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>)&#8212;Paul notes that the problem is spiritual stubbornness. <a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a> shows a similar tension: knowledge does not always produce admission of truth. Their reluctance betrays a deeper resistance to the gospel rather than ignorance of facts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I lived as a Pharisee,</b><p>Before Christ, Paul belonged to the very group most scrupulous about Mosaic Law. <a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a> records him saying, &#8220;I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee&#8221;. His former identity strengthens his present defense: he did not abandon Torah out of ignorance; he met its fulfillment in Jesus (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5&#8211;6</a> details how his Pharisaic pedigree included circumcision, tribe, and zeal&#8212;credentials his accusers cannot match.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>adhering to the strictest sect of our religion.</b><p>Pharisaism demanded rigorous obedience. <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a> notes Paul was &#8220;zealous for God as all of you are today&#8221;. The &#8220;strictest sect&#8221; language parallels Jesus&#8217; observation that Pharisees &#8220;tie up heavy burdens&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>). Paul&#8217;s claim spotlights continuity: the gospel he now preaches flows from the same Scriptures he once guarded with Pharisaic fervor (<a href="/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s defense in <a href="/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> rests on a shared, verifiable biography. Long-standing observers can confirm his Pharisaic zeal, yet their unwillingness to testify lays bare spiritual resistance, not factual doubt. By stressing his past in the &#8220;strictest sect,&#8221; Paul demonstrates that faith in Christ is not a break from Scripture but its fulfillment&#8212;turning a lifetime of rigorous law-keeping into a living proclamation of grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">After the most straitest sect.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">most rigid, </span>or <span class= "ital">most precise.</span> The Greek does not contain anything answering to the double superlative of the English.
