David, a central figure in Israel's history, is often seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the Messiah. The reference to David underscores the continuity between the Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus Christ. This connection is crucial for understanding the legitimacy of Jesus as the promised Messiah, as David's lineage and his writings in the Psalms are frequently cited in the New Testament to affirm Jesus' messianic role.<p><b>&#8216;I saw the Lord always before me;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the constant presence and guidance of the Lord. In the context of David's life, it reflects his reliance on God during times of trial and triumph. For early Christians, this statement would resonate as an assurance of Christ's presence and guidance. Theologically, it speaks to the omnipresence of God and the believer's ability to live with the awareness of God's continual presence. This phrase also connects to the idea of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, always leading and protecting His flock.<p><b>because He is at my right hand,</b><br>The right hand is a position of honor and strength. In ancient cultures, being at someone's right hand signified a place of power and support. For David, this meant God's unwavering support and strength in his kingship and personal life. In the New Testament context, it reflects Jesus' exalted position at the right hand of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. This imagery reinforces the authority and power of Christ, who intercedes for believers and reigns with God.<p><b>I will not be shaken.</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of security and stability. For David, it meant confidence in God's protection and promises, despite the challenges he faced. In the broader biblical narrative, it speaks to the unshakeable foundation that faith in God provides. For Christians, this assurance is found in Jesus Christ, who is described as the cornerstone and the rock of salvation. This confidence is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/62-6.htm">Psalm 62:6</a>, where the psalmist declares trust in God as a refuge and fortress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>King David, the second king of Israel, is the speaker in this prophecy.

Because Jesus lives in that constant presence and now shares it with every believer, we, too, can walk in confident awareness of God, rest in His power, and stand unshaken no matter what comes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">For David speaketh concerning him.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">in reference to Him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in words which extended to Him. Reading Psalms 16 without this interpretation, it seems as if it spoke only of the confidence of the writer that he would be himself delivered from the grave and death. Some interpreters confine that confidence to a temporal deliverance; some extend it to the thought of immortality, or even of a resurrection. But Peter had been taught, both by his Lord and by the Spirit, that all such hopes extend beyond themselves--that the ideal of victory after suffering, no less than that of the righteous sufferer, was realised in Christ. The fact of the Resurrection had given a new meaning to prophecies which would not, of themselves, have suggested it, but which were incomplete without it.<p><span class= "bld">He is on my</span> <span class= "bld">right hand.</span>--The Psalmist thought of the Eternal as the warrior thinks of him who, in the conflict of battle, extends his shield over the comrade who is on the left hand, and so guards him from attack. When the Son of Man is said to sit on the right hand of God (<a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>) the imagery is different, and brings before us the picture of a king seated on his throne with his heir sitting in the place of honour by his side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Saith</span> for <span class="accented">speaketh</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">held</span> for <span class="accented">foresaw</span>, A.V. The sixteenth psalm is ascribed to David in the title prefixed to it in the Hebrew and the LXX. Without pronouncing the titles to be infallible, we must confess that they carry great weight with them in the absence of any strong internal evidence against them. Meyer speaks of the psalm as "certainly later than David," and Ewald and others ascribe it to the time of the Captivity; but Hitzig thinks the internal evidence is in favor of its belonging to the time before David ascended the throne ('Speaker's Commentary'). We may safely rest on the authority of St. Peter here and St. Paul (<a href="/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35, 36</a>), and be satisfied that it is really David's. The manner in which it is quoted by the two apostles is also very strong evidence that by the Jews of that day it was generally admitted to be a Messianic psalm. The following quotation is verbatim from the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#945;&#965;&#8054;&#948;</span> <span class="translit">(Dauid)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1138.htm">Strong's 1138: </a> </span><span class="str2">David, King of Israel.
