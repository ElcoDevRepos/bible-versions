His associates would include other leading members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. This group held significant religious and political power in Jerusalem. The high priest and his associates were responsible for maintaining the religious order and were often in conflict with the early Christian movement, which they saw as a threat to their authority.<p><b>who belonged to the party of the Sadducees</b><br>The Sadducees were a sect within Judaism known for their aristocratic status and control of the temple. They were distinct from the Pharisees, another Jewish sect, in their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits, as noted in <a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>. Their theological beliefs were more conservative, adhering strictly to the written Torah and rejecting oral traditions. The Sadducees' collaboration with Roman authorities helped them maintain their power, but it also made them wary of any movements that could disrupt the status quo, such as the burgeoning Christian church.<p><b>were filled with jealousy</b><br>The jealousy of the Sadducees was likely fueled by the apostles' growing influence and the miracles being performed in Jesus' name, which attracted large crowds and followers. This jealousy is reminiscent of the envy that led to Jesus' crucifixion, as noted in <a href="/matthew/27-18.htm">Matthew 27:18</a>. The apostles' success threatened the Sadducees' religious authority and their control over the people.

In the First Epistle of Clement, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied to the anger of Cain, of Joseph's brethren, of the Israelites against Moses, of the persecution of St. Peter and St. Paul (iv., 5.). It is only occasionally that it means that kind of anger which we call <span class="accented">jealousy.</span> The high priest and his party were indignant at the defiance of their authority, and at the success of the doctrine which they had made it a special object to put down. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
