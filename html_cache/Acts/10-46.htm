Here, it signifies the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Gentiles, similar to what the Jewish believers experienced. This event marks a pivotal moment in the early church, demonstrating that the gift of the Holy Spirit is not limited by ethnic or cultural boundaries. The ability to speak in tongues serves as a sign of divine approval and inclusion into the body of Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>and exalting God.</b><br>The act of exalting God indicates a response of worship and acknowledgment of His greatness. This mirrors the response of the Jewish believers at Pentecost, who also praised God when filled with the Holy Spirit. The Gentiles' worship underscores the universality of the gospel message and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>. It also reflects the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, where all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>Then Peter said,</b><br>Peter, a leading apostle, plays a crucial role in the early church's expansion to the Gentiles. His presence and response are significant, as he had received a vision from God in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, preparing him for this moment. Peter's willingness to accept the Gentiles into the faith community demonstrates the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in overcoming traditional Jewish prejudices. This moment is a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth," and it sets a precedent for the inclusion of all people in the church, as further discussed in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, a key leader in the early Christian church, and the primary speaker in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion who is devout and God-fearing, whose household is the setting for this event.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_of_cornelius.htm">Household of Cornelius</a></b><br>Includes family and close friends gathered to hear Peter's message, experiencing the Holy Spirit's outpouring.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, whose presence is manifested through the speaking in tongues and exalting God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>The city where Cornelius lives, a significant location for the spread of the Gospel to Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The event at Cornelius' house demonstrates that the Gospel is for all people, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit's presence is evidenced by speaking in tongues, signifying divine approval and empowerment for ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles into the faith community highlights the unity and diversity within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_leading.htm">Obedience to God's Leading</a></b><br>Peter's willingness to visit Cornelius, despite cultural barriers, shows the importance of obedience to God's direction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response_to_god's_work.htm">Worship as a Response to God's Work</a></b><br>The exalting of God by Cornelius' household is a natural response to the work of the Holy Spirit and should be a model for believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_10_46_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 10:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_46_Holy_Spirit_in_Gentiles.htm">How does Acts 10:46 demonstrate the Holy Spirit's work among Gentile believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Tongues_role_in_God_s_acceptance_in_Acts_10.htm">What role does speaking in tongues play in confirming God's acceptance in Acts 10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_sense_the_Holy_Spirit_today_2.htm">How can we discern the Holy Spirit's presence in our church today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_10_46_to_Pentecost_in_Acts_2.htm">How does Acts 10:46 connect with the events of Pentecost in Acts 2?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_46_God_s_inclusive_salvation.htm">How should Acts 10:46 influence our view of God's inclusivity in salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_10_46_tongues_mean.htm">What does speaking in tongues signify in Acts 10:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_46_Challenge_to_Jewish-Christian_norms.htm">How does Acts 10:46 challenge traditional Jewish-Christian boundaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Holy_Spirit_in_Acts_10_46.htm">Why is the Holy Spirit's presence significant in Acts 10:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_'foundation_of_apostles'.htm">What does 'The End of All Things Is at Hand' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_worship_styles.htm">What are the different styles of worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/proof_gentiles_got_holy_spirit,_tongues.htm">Acts 10:44-46 -
