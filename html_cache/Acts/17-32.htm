The Epicureans and Stoics, who were present in Athens, had differing views on life after death. The Epicureans generally denied any form of afterlife, while the Stoics believed in a more pantheistic view of the soul. The resurrection of the dead, as preached by Paul, was a radical idea that challenged both philosophical schools. In Jewish tradition, the resurrection was a well-established belief, particularly among the Pharisees, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>. This doctrine is central to Christian faith, as it affirms Jesus Christ's victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.<p><b>some began to mock him</b><br>Mockery was a common reaction to the preaching of the Gospel, especially when it involved miraculous events like the resurrection. This response reflects the skepticism and intellectual pride prevalent in Athens, a city known for its philosophical heritage. The mocking echoes the scorn Jesus faced during His ministry, as seen in <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>, where He was ridiculed by onlookers at His crucifixion. This reaction also fulfills Jesus' warning in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> that His followers would face persecution and derision.<p><b>but others said, &#8220;We want to hear you again on this topic.&#8221;</b><br>This response indicates an openness and curiosity among some of the Athenians. It reflects the diverse reactions to the Gospel message, as seen throughout Acts. The Bereans, mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, were commended for their eagerness to examine the Scriptures. Similarly, these Athenians show a willingness to explore new ideas, which is a hallmark of the city's intellectual culture. This openness provides an opportunity for further dialogue and evangelism, illustrating the varied soil in which the seed of the Gospel is sown, as described in the Parable of the Sower in <a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is delivering the message about Jesus and the resurrection to the people of Athens.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A city known for its intellectual and philosophical pursuits, where Paul is speaking at the Areopagus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_areopagus.htm">The Areopagus</a></b><br>A prominent rock outcropping in Athens that served as a place for discussion and debate, especially concerning religious and philosophical matters.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Comprised of Athenians and foreigners, including philosophers from the Epicurean and Stoic schools, who are listening to Paul's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The central theme of Paul's message, which provokes a mixed reaction from the audience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Power of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith.

(See Note on <a href="/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>.) We may venture to assume that the mockers were found chiefly among the Epicureans, and that the inquirers, perhaps putting off the inquiry to a "more convenient season," were Stoics, who wished to hear more from a teacher with whom they found themselves in sympathy on so many points of contact with their own system. Whether they carried on their inquiry we are not told. The words that follow imply a certain indignation on the part of the Apostle.

Athenian skepticism could not accept so spiritual a truth as the resurrection of the dead; and Athenian levity of purpose deferred to another day the decisive step of accepting the salvation of the risen Savior, just as it had deferred resistance to Philip of Macedon till their liberties were gone and their country enslaved.
