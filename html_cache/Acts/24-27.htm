The two-year duration highlights the Roman legal system's inefficiency and the political maneuvering that often delayed justice. It also reflects the patience and endurance of Paul, who continued his ministry even while confined. This period allowed Paul to write letters and strengthen the early Christian communities.<p><b>Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus</b><br>Felix, the Roman governor, was known for his corruption and harsh rule, which eventually led to his recall to Rome. Porcius Festus succeeded him around AD 59-60. Festus was considered more just and competent than Felix, but he inherited the complex situation involving Paul. The transition of power is significant as it sets the stage for Paul's appeal to Caesar, fulfilling God's plan for Paul to testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>).<p><b>And wishing to do the Jews a favor</b><br>Felix's desire to appease the Jewish leaders reflects the political tensions of the time. The Roman governors often sought to maintain peace in Judea by placating influential Jewish factions. This phrase underscores the precarious balance of power and the compromises made by Roman officials to avoid unrest. It also highlights the persistent opposition Paul faced from Jewish authorities who viewed his teachings as a threat.<p><b>Felix left Paul in prison</b><br>Felix's decision to leave Paul imprisoned was a political move rather than a legal necessity. Despite recognizing Paul's innocence, Felix prioritized his political standing over justice. This action parallels other instances in Scripture where God's servants faced unjust treatment, such as Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>) and Jesus before Pilate (<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12-16</a>).

Literally, <span class= "ital">When a period of two years was accomplished, Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor.</span> We can, of course, only conjecture how these years were spent. Some writers who maintain the Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews have assigned it to this period: others have supposed that the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon were written from Caesarea; but there is no adequate evidence in support of either hypothesis. It is better to confine ourselves to the thought of the Apostle's patient resignation, learning obedience by the things he suffered--of his intercourse with Philip, and other members of the Church of Caesarea, as comforting and refreshing to him. We may venture, perhaps, to think of St. Luke, who had come with him to Jerusalem, and who sailed with him from Caesarea, as not far off from him during his imprisonment. Attention has already been called (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's Gospel and to the Acts</span>) to the probable use made by the Evangelist of these opportunities for collecting materials for his two histories.<p>The change of administration was caused by the complaints which the Jews brought against Felix, and which led Nero to recall him. The influence of his brother Pallas availed, however, to save him from any further punishment. His successor, Festus, who came to the province in A.D. 60, died in his second year of office. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 14, ? 1) speaks of him as suppressing the outrages of the robbers who infested the country, and maintaining the tranquility of the province. Felix, with characteristic baseness, sought by his latest act to court the favour of the Jews, and left the Apostle in prison as a set-off against the many charges which were brought against him.<p><span class= "bld">Willing to shew the Jews a pleasure.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to deposit a favour.</span> The boon conferred was not to be without return.

Jud.,' 20. 9:1). But the impression derived from Josephus is the same as that conveyed by St. Luke, that he was a just and upright ruler, in marked contrast with Felix his predecessor, and his successors Albinus and Gessius Florus. <span class="cmt_word">Desiring to gain favor</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to lay up in store good will</span>, or favor, or <span class="accented">a boon</span>, to be requited at some future period. A frequent phrase in the best classical authors. Felix had good reason thus to try and put the Jews under obligation to him at the close of his government. For the danger was great to the retiring governor of complaints being sent to the emperor of oppression and plunder, which were often listened to and punished. Josephus relates, in point of fact, that the chief Jews in Caesarea sent an embassy to Rome to lodge a charge against Felix before Nero; and that he only escaped punishment by the influence of his brother Pallas ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9). The scene in this chapter is a very striking one, depicted with admirable simplicity and force. The bloated slave sitting on the seat of judgment and power, representing all the worst vices of Roman degeneracy. The beads of the sinking Jewish commonwealth, blinded by bigotry and nearly mad with hatred, forgetting for the moment their abhorrence of their Roman masters, in their yet deeper detestation of the Apostle Paul. The hired advocate with his fulsome flattery, his rounded periods, and his false charges. And then the great apostle, the noble confessor, the finished Christian gentleman, the pure-minded, upright, and fearless man, pleading his own cause with consummate force and dignity, and overawing his heathen judge by the majesty of his character. It is a graphic description of s very noble scene. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/24-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two years</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#949;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Dietias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1333.htm">Strong's 1333: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dietes; a space of two years.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had passed,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pl&#275;r&#333;theis&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4137.htm">Strong's 4137: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pleres; to make replete, i.e. to cram, level up, or to furnish, satisfy, execute, finish, verify, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Felix</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#8134;&#955;&#953;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(Ph&#275;lix)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5344.htm">Strong's 5344: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Latin origin; happy; Phelix, a Roman.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was succeeded by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(diadochon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1240.htm">Strong's 1240: </a> </span><span class="str2">A successor.
