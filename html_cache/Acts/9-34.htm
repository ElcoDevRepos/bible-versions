The name is also found in Greek mythology, but here it identifies a real person in the early Christian community. His condition and healing serve as a testament to the power of Jesus Christ working through the apostles.<p><b>Peter said to him,</b><br>Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early church, is the speaker. His role as a leader is emphasized in Acts, where he performs miracles and preaches the gospel. This reflects the authority given to him by Christ (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Jesus Christ heals you!</b><br>Peter attributes the healing directly to Jesus Christ, emphasizing that the power comes from Jesus, not from Peter himself. This aligns with the apostolic teaching that miracles are signs pointing to Jesus' divine authority and the truth of the gospel (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6, 16</a>).<p><b>Get up and put away your mat.&#8221;</b><br>This command mirrors Jesus' own healings, such as the healing of the paralytic in <a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>. It signifies a complete restoration to health and the end of Aeneas's dependence on his mat, which symbolized his previous condition of paralysis.<p><b>Immediately Aeneas got up,</b><br>The immediacy of the healing underscores the miraculous nature of the event. It demonstrates the power of Jesus' name and serves as a sign to others of the truth of the apostles' message.

In the assonance of the Greek words (<span class= "ital">Iesus i?tai se</span>) we may, perhaps, trace a desire to impress the thought that the very name of Jesus testified that He was the great Healer.
