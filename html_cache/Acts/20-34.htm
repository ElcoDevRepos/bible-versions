Luke has already noted, &#8220;he was a tentmaker by trade&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>).<p>- Paul often highlighted working with his own hands: &#8220;We toil, working with our own hands&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>).<p>- His physical work illustrates humble service, following the example of the Lord who &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have ministered to my own needs</b><p>- Rather than relying on the Ephesian church&#8217;s resources, Paul met his necessities himself, fulfilling what he wrote elsewhere: &#8220;For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p>- This self-support protected the gospel from accusations of financial exploitation (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12-15</a>) and modeled contentment (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p>- His example aligns with <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, &#8220;All hard work brings a profit,&#8221; showing practical obedience to God&#8217;s wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those of my companions</b><p>- Paul&#8217;s labor overflowed to supply his coworkers as well, embodying sacrificial generosity: &#8220;The laborer is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>), yet Paul chose to waive his own for the sake of others.<p>- <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> lists those traveling with him&#8212;Timothy, Trophimus, and others&#8212;whose provisions were helped by Paul&#8217;s earnings.<p>- This mirrors the early church&#8217;s ethos: &#8220;There was not a needy person among them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34</a>) and anticipates his charge in the next verse, &#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>).<p>- Such care advances gospel mission, as seen when churches supplied Paul: &#8220;You sent me aid again and again when I was in need&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-16.htm">Philippians 4:16</a>); here, Paul flips the pattern by personally supplying his team.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a> reveals a leader whose life matches his message.
