This phrase indicates a period of spiritual preparation and discernment. Fasting is often associated with seeking divine intervention or clarity, as seen in other biblical instances such as <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>. Prayer, a central aspect of Christian life, is emphasized throughout the New Testament, highlighting the importance of communication with God (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>). The combination of fasting and prayer suggests a solemn and earnest approach to decision-making, particularly in commissioning individuals for ministry.<p><b>they laid their hands on them</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act with roots in the Old Testament, often associated with blessing, commissioning, or imparting authority (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). In the New Testament, it is used in various contexts, including healing (<a href="/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a>), receiving the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>), and ordination (<a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>). Here, it signifies the church's recognition and endorsement of Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for their missionary work. This act also represents a transfer of spiritual authority and support, aligning with the practice of setting apart individuals for specific tasks within the community of believers.<p><b>and sent them off</b><br>The sending off of Barnabas and Saul marks the beginning of Paul's first missionary journey, a pivotal moment in the spread of the Gospel to the Gentile world. This action reflects the church's obedience to the Holy Spirit's direction, as seen earlier in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>. The term "sent" implies a mission with purpose and divine mandate, echoing Jesus' Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. The church in Antioch, a significant center for early Christianity, becomes a launching point for missionary activity, demonstrating the shift from a predominantly Jewish context to a broader, inclusive mission field. This moment underscores the church's role in fulfilling God's redemptive plan for all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key leader in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of other believers.

It does not follow that the laying on of hands was on the same day. On the contrary, the mention of the fasting again in this verse makes it impossible so to understand it. Doubtless, on receiving this intimation of the Spirit, they fixed a day for the ordination, and prepared for it by fasting and prayer. The ember days of the Church before ordinations are m accordance with this precedent of Holy Scripture.
