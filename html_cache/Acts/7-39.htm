The refusal to obey highlights a recurring theme of rebellion against divinely appointed leadership, seen throughout the Old Testament. This disobedience is a reflection of the human tendency to resist God's commands, as seen in other instances such as the rebellion against God in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). The Israelites' refusal to obey Moses can be seen as a type of humanity's broader rebellion against God, which is ultimately addressed through the obedience of Jesus Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>Instead, they rejected him</b><br>The rejection of Moses by the Israelites is symbolic of the rejection of God's messengers throughout biblical history. This rejection is paralleled in the New Testament with the rejection of Jesus Christ by the Jewish leaders and people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). Moses, as a type of Christ, foreshadows the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus. The rejection of divine leadership is a recurring theme, emphasizing the need for repentance and acceptance of God's chosen deliverer.<p><b>and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</b><br>Turning back to Egypt in their hearts signifies a longing for the past and a lack of faith in God's promises. Egypt represents bondage and slavery, both physically and spiritually. This longing for Egypt is a metaphor for the temptation to return to a life of sin and bondage rather than embracing the freedom offered by God. The Israelites' desire to return to Egypt reflects a spiritual condition that is addressed in the New Testament, where believers are called to leave behind their old lives and follow Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Egypt, in this context, serves as a symbol of the world and its enticements, which believers are urged to forsake in pursuit of the promised land, representing eternal life with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, Stephen is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.
