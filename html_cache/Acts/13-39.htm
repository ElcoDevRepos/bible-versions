The concept of "through Him" emphasizes the mediatory role of Christ in salvation. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus declares, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." This underscores the belief that Jesus is the sole pathway to reconciliation with God, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many.<p><b>everyone who believes</b><br>The inclusivity of "everyone" highlights the universal offer of salvation, transcending ethnic, cultural, and social barriers. This is a significant theme in the Book of Acts, as the early church expands beyond Jewish communities to include Gentiles. Belief, or faith, is the key requirement for justification, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, which states that if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart, you will be saved. This reflects the shift from the works-based righteousness of the law to faith-based righteousness.<p><b>is justified</b><br>Justification is a legal term signifying a declaration of righteousness. In the context of the New Testament, it means being declared righteous before God. <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a> states, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." This concept is central to Pauline theology, emphasizing that justification is a gift of grace through faith, not by works, as further elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>from everything</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the justification offered through Christ. It suggests that all sins, regardless of their nature or severity, can be forgiven. This aligns with 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, which assures believers that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The totality of forgiveness is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, offering complete redemption.<p><b>from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses</b><br>The law of Moses, given in the Old Testament, includes the Ten Commandments and various ceremonial laws. While the law was holy and righteous, as stated in <a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, it was incapable of providing complete justification because it highlighted human sinfulness and the need for a savior. <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a> describes the law as a "tutor" leading us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. The inability of the law to justify is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the superiority of the new covenant established through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is delivering the message in <a href="/bsb/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.

It reveals sin but cannot remove it. Only through Christ can we be truly justified.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The message of justification through Christ is for everyone, regardless of background or previous adherence to the law.

It is interesting to note in this, the first recorded example of St. Paul's teaching, the occurrence of the word which, as time passed on, came to be almost identified with him and with his work. It is clearly used, as interpreted by the "forgiveness of sins" in the context, in its forensic sense, as meaning "acquitted," "declared not guilty." (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">From which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span>--The words are full of meaning, as the germ of all that was most characteristic in St. Paul's later teaching. The Law, with its high standard of righteousness (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>), its demand of entire obedience, its sacrifices which bore witness to the burden of sin, yet had no power to liberate conscience from its thraldom (<a href="/context/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1-3</a>), had taught him that its function in the spiritual life of man was to work out the knowledge of sin (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>), not to emancipate men from it. The sense of freedom from guilt, and therefore of a true life, was to be found, as he had learnt by his own experience, through faith in Christ.
