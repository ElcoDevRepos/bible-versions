The term "all Israel" refers to the Jewish people, emphasizing the message's importance to the entire nation. The certainty mentioned here underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the undeniable truth of Jesus' identity and mission. This call to knowledge is rooted in the Jewish tradition of seeking truth and understanding, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Shema calls Israel to hear and know the Lord.<p><b>that God has made this Jesus</b><br>The phrase highlights the divine action in establishing Jesus' role and authority. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and His sovereign plan. The use of "this Jesus" points directly to the historical figure who lived, taught, and performed miracles among them, as recorded in the Gospels. It emphasizes the continuity of Jesus' earthly ministry with His exalted status. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where God exalts Jesus and gives Him the name above every name.<p><b>whom you crucified</b><br>This part of the verse directly addresses the responsibility of the Jewish people in the crucifixion of Jesus. It serves as a convicting reminder of their actions, which were part of God's redemptive plan. The crucifixion, a Roman method of execution, was carried out at the behest of Jewish leaders, as seen in the Gospel accounts. This phrase also connects to <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant is described, pointing to the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death.<p><b>both Lord and Christ!</b><br>The declaration of Jesus as "Lord" and "Christ" affirms His divine authority and messianic role. "Lord" (Kyrios in Greek) is a title of divinity and sovereignty, often used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew name for God, Yahweh. "Christ" (Christos in Greek) means "Anointed One," equivalent to the Hebrew "Messiah." This dual title confirms Jesus as the promised deliverer and ruler, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.

The word "Lord" is used with special reference to the prophetic utterance of the Psalm thus cited. There is a rhetorical force in the very order of the words which the English can scarcely give: "that both Lord and Christ hath God made this Jesus whom ye crucified." The pronoun of the last verb is emphatic, as pointing the contrast between the way in which the Jews of Jerusalem had dealt with Jesus and the recognition which he had received from the Father. The utterance of the word "crucified" at the close, pressing home the guilt of the people on their consciences, may be thought of as, in a special manner, working the result described in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- Let all the house of Israel therefore</span> for <span class="accented">therefore let all the house of Israel</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified</span> for <span class="accented">that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ</span>, A.V., a change very much for the worse, inasmuch as the R.V. is not an English phrase, and adds nothing to the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
