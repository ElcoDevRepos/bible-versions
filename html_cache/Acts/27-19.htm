In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, it marks a critical point in the storm at sea, emphasizing the severity and duration of the crisis. Biblically, the third day is associated with resurrection and new beginnings, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>) and Jonah's deliverance from the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>). This timing underscores the desperation and urgency faced by those on the ship.<p><b>they threw the ship&#8217;s tackle overboard</b><br>The act of throwing the ship's tackle overboard indicates the extreme measures taken to lighten the ship during the storm. The tackle included essential equipment for sailing, such as ropes, pulleys, and other gear necessary for navigation and control. This decision reflects the dire situation and the crew's willingness to sacrifice vital resources in hopes of survival. It also highlights the futility of human efforts in the face of overwhelming natural forces, a theme echoed in other biblical accounts of divine intervention during storms (<a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37-41</a>).<p><b>with their own hands</b><br>The phrase "with their own hands" emphasizes the personal involvement and labor of those on board, including the sailors and possibly the passengers. This detail suggests a collective effort and shared responsibility in the crisis, regardless of rank or status. It also illustrates the humility and vulnerability of humanity when confronted with forces beyond their control. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for the need for personal repentance and reliance on God's providence, as human strength alone is insufficient for salvation (<a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The Apostle Paul, a central figure in the New Testament, is on his way to Rome as a prisoner.

God allows the crisis to deepen so that His deliverance will be unmistakable (compare <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17-2</a>:10, where rescue also follows a third-day marker).<p>- The delay highlights perseverance in trial. Paul had earlier forewarned danger (<a href="/acts/27-10.htm">Acts 27:10</a>), yet he now endures alongside everyone, modeling steadfast faith (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they threw the ship&#8217;s tackle overboard</b><p>- &#8220;Tackle&#8221; includes ropes, pulleys, spare spars&#8212;critical equipment for steering and maintaining a vessel. Discarding it means surrendering self-reliance and trusting God&#8217;s promise of survival (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-25</a>).<p>- Similar scenes of jettisoned cargo emphasize the costliness of obedience and the priority of life over possessions (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>; <a href="/acts/27-38.htm">Acts 27:38</a>).<p>- Spur-of-the-moment sacrifices remind believers that even good tools can become hindrances when God calls us to travel lighter (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with their own hands</b><p>- The sailors personally hurl the gear; Luke stresses eyewitness detail and the crew&#8217;s desperation. No delegation&#8212;everyone is involved (cf. <a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37-38</a>, where seasoned fishermen fear for their lives).<p>- Their &#8220;own hands&#8221; echo the necessity of active trust: God promised deliverance, yet they still had to act (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<p>- Paul&#8217;s calm leadership shines in this chaos&#8212;he neither panics nor withdraws but remains present, embodying Christlike composure (<a href="/acts/27-33.htm">Acts 27:33-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-19.htm">Acts 27:19</a> records a literal, third-day moment when seasoned sailors, pressed to the brink, flung vital gear into the sea with their own hands. The verse spotlights escalating peril, voluntary sacrifice of essentials, and wholehearted participation in God&#8217;s unfolding rescue. It calls believers to endure trials, release anything that impedes obedience, and actively trust the Lord who sovereignly guides every storm-tossed voyage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">We cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span>--The better MSS. give the third person plural, and not the first. If we accept the Received text, the fact that the passengers as well as the crew were pressed into the service indicates the urgency of the peril; but even with the other reading, the words describe the prompt spontaneous action caused by a strong sense of danger. The Greek word for "tackling" (better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">furniture</span>) is wider in its range than the English, and includes the beds and personal luggage and movables of all kinds. Even these the sailors were ready to sacrifice for the chance of safety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - They for <span class="accented">we</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">their</span> for <span class="accented">our</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The third day</span> after leaving Clanda.

The word seems to mark that the sacrifice was very great, implying a very pressing danger. <span class="cmt_word">The tackling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>). There is great difference of opinion as to what the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> means here. Smith thinks the main spar is meant, "the huge mainyard," and Farrar adopts his view, which he thinks is strengthened by the use of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (for he adopts the T.R.), implying one single act, and showing, by the use of the first person, that it was the act of the whole crew united. Alford thinks that it means all the furniture, beds, and movables of all kinds, and <span class="accented">so</span> Wordsworth and Meyer. Wetstein explains it of the passengers' baggage. Howson thinks it unlikely they would have thrown away a great spar which would have supported twenty or thirty men in the water in the event of the ship foundering. Schleusner renders it "apparatus quo navis erat instructa." <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, and it is difficult to speak decisively. But the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and the general use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> in classical Greek favors the interpretation "the ship's furniture" ("meubles et ustensiles," Renan). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
