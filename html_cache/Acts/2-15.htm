This miraculous event led some onlookers to mock them, suggesting they were drunk. Peter's response here is a defense against this accusation. The cultural context of the time shows that drunkenness was not uncommon, but Peter's assertion highlights the absurdity of the claim given the time of day. This moment also fulfills Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, marking the beginning of the Church's mission.<p><b>It is only the third hour of the day!</b><br>The "third hour" refers to approximately 9:00 AM, as the Jewish day began at sunrise, around 6:00 AM. This detail underscores the unlikelihood of the apostles being drunk, as it was customary for Jews to refrain from eating or drinking until after morning prayers. This time reference also connects to the Jewish practice of morning sacrifices, aligning the outpouring of the Holy Spirit with a time of worship and devotion. The early hour emphasizes the divine nature of the event, distinguishing it from ordinary human behavior and pointing to the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy about the outpouring of the Spirit (<a
