The "outer gate" refers to the entrance of a typical first-century home, which often had a courtyard with a gate separating it from the street. This setting highlights the urgency and secrecy of Peter's situation, as he seeks refuge among fellow believers. The act of knocking signifies Peter's desire to enter a place of safety and fellowship, reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a> about asking, seeking, and knocking. The outer gate also symbolizes the boundary between the hostile world and the community of believers.<p><b>and a servant girl named Rhoda</b><br>Rhoda, whose name means "rose" in Greek, is identified as a servant girl, indicating her low social status in the household. Her presence in the narrative underscores the inclusivity of the early Christian community, where individuals of all social standings played significant roles. The mention of her name suggests her importance in the early church, as personal names are often omitted for minor characters. Rhoda's role is reminiscent of other biblical figures who, despite their humble positions, are used by God to fulfill His purposes, such as the servant girl in <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2-3</a> who directed Naaman to Elisha.<p><b>came to answer it</b><br>Rhoda's action of coming to answer the gate demonstrates her responsibility and attentiveness, qualities valued in a servant. Her response is immediate, reflecting the communal vigilance and expectation of the early Christians, who were likely gathered in prayer for Peter's release (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>). This moment also highlights the theme of divine intervention and human response, as God orchestrates events beyond human control, yet involves His people in the unfolding of His plans. Rhoda's role in this narrative parallels the faithful response expected of believers when God answers prayer, as seen in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, where the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who was miraculously freed from prison by an angel.

Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>), and He promises, &#8220;Knock, and it will be opened to you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s persistent knock mirrors his confidence that God, who opened the prison doors (<a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10&#8211;11</a>), will now open hearts and homes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the outer gate</b><p>&#8226; First-century homes commonly had a street gate leading into a courtyard. Peter stops here, respecting household order (compare <a href="/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15-16</a> where servants guard a gate).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s rescue brings him from iron bars (<a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a>) to a wooden gate&#8212;yet both open by God&#8217;s providence. &#8220;Blessed are those whose strength is in You&#8230; even the doorkeeper in the house of my God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5, 10</a>).<p>&#8226; The gate also pictures safety. While Herod hunts for Peter (<a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>), God provides a secure threshold much like the blood-covered lintel protected Israelites in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a servant girl named Rhoda</b><p>&#8226; Luke records her name&#8212;Rhoda, meaning &#8220;rose&#8221;&#8212;underscoring that every believer, no matter social rank, is known and valued (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Servant girls feature prominently in Scripture: the unnamed maid tells Naaman about Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2-3</a>), and the servant who recognized Peter by the firelight (<a href="/luke/22-56.htm">Luke 22:56</a>). God regularly uses the overlooked to advance His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Rhoda serves in Mary&#8217;s house, a gathering place for prayer (<a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>). Her presence confirms that households can be centers of ministry, echoing Lydia&#8217;s home in <a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a> and the jailer&#8217;s in <a href="/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to answer it</b><p>&#8226; Rhoda &#8220;came to answer,&#8221; illustrating alertness and willingness.

God honors such courage with firsthand participation in His miracles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a> spotlights humble actions that God weaves into His rescue plan: Peter&#8217;s faithful knock, the protective outer gate, a named servant girl, and her eager response.

This is the primary sense of the word; that of <span class="accented">answering</span> after listening is a secondary sense. At a time of such alarm to Christians a knock at the door in the dead of the night would carry terror with it, and careful listening to ascertain whether there was more than one person, and then to ask who was there and what was his business, was the natural course. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
