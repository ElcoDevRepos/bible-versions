It follows the previous day's events where Festus discussed Paul's case with King Agrippa. The timing underscores the importance of the trial and the interest it generated among the local authorities.<p><b>Agrippa and Bernice</b><br>King Agrippa II and his sister Bernice were part of the Herodian dynasty, known for their complex relationship with the Jewish people and the Roman Empire. Agrippa II was the great-grandson of Herod the Great, who ruled during Jesus' birth. Bernice, often accompanying Agrippa, was known for her influence and controversial personal life, which was a subject of gossip and scandal in Roman society.<p><b>came with great pomp</b><br>The phrase "great pomp" suggests a display of wealth, power, and authority. This was typical of Roman and Herodian rulers who used such displays to assert their status and command respect. The Greek word used here, "phantasia," implies a showy display, highlighting the contrast between the earthly power of Agrippa and Bernice and the spiritual authority of Paul.<p><b>and entered the auditorium</b><br>The auditorium, or "place of hearing," was likely a large hall used for public gatherings and official proceedings. This setting emphasizes the formal and public nature of the trial. Archaeological findings in Caesarea, where this event took place, reveal structures that could have served such purposes, reflecting the Roman architectural influence in Judea.<p><b>along with the commanders and leading men of the city</b><br>The presence of commanders and leading men indicates the high-profile nature of the trial. These were likely Roman military officers and local civic leaders, illustrating the intersection of Roman political power and local governance. Their attendance underscores the significance of Paul's case, which had implications for both Roman law and Jewish customs.<p><b>And Festus ordered that Paul be brought in</b><br>Festus, the Roman governor, played a crucial role in the legal proceedings. His order to bring Paul in highlights the Roman legal process and the rights of a Roman citizen, which Paul was. This moment sets the stage for Paul's defense and his opportunity to witness about his faith before a diverse and influential audience, fulfilling his mission to spread the Gospel to the Gentiles and rulers, as foretold in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agrippa.htm">Agrippa</a></b><br>King Herod Agrippa II, the last of the Herodian dynasty, known for his knowledge of Jewish customs and laws.

Paul&#8217;s calm obedience shows trust in Christ&#8217;s promise of protection and purpose (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23</a> contrasts worldly pomp with gospel power. A glittering assembly of royalty, officers, and dignitaries gathers, yet God&#8217;s spotlight falls on a humble apostle. The verse demonstrates:<p>&#8226; Divine timing&#8212;events unfold &#8220;the next day&#8221; to fulfill Christ&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; Sovereign placement&#8212;Paul stands before the highest earthly authorities, just as promised.<p>&#8226; Stark contrast&#8212;earthly splendor sets the stage for heavenly truth.<p>&#8226; Gospel reach&#8212;every social stratum hears the message.<p>In one concise scene, the Lord turns political pageantry into a platform for eternal proclamation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">When Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp.</span>--The description may be noted as probably coming from one who had been an eye-witness of the stately parade, and was able to report with precision all that had passed. The fact was the first fulfilment of the promise that the Apostle was to bear His witness before "kings" as well as rulers (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>). The Greek word for "pomp" (more literally, <span class= "ital">show</span>) is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. There is an almost tragic pathos in the thought, which must have been present to the mind of the historian, and perhaps, also, to that of others, that this display of the pride of state was exhibited in the very city that had witnessed the terrible chastisement of a like display in his father. The vice was inherited: the lesson had not been learnt.<p><span class= "bld">The chief captains.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">chiliarchs, </span>as in <a href="/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- So</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they were</span> for <span class="accented">was</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the principal</span> for <span class="accented">principal</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the command of Festus</span> for <span class="accented">Festus</span> <span class="accented">commandment</span>, A.V.;<span class="accented">brought in</span> for <span class="accented">brought forth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">With great pomp</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, here only in the New Testament.
