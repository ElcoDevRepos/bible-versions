His conversion was a significant event, as he was a well-known figure among the Jewish leaders. The plot against Saul highlights the immediate danger he faced due to his newfound faith. This reflects the early church's struggles and the hostility from Jewish authorities who saw the Christian movement as a threat. Saul's awareness of the plot suggests divine intervention and protection, a theme consistent with God's providence throughout Scripture, as seen in the protection of figures like David from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11-12</a>).<p><b>Day and night they watched the city gates</b><br>The city gates of Damascus were strategic locations for controlling entry and exit, often heavily guarded and monitored. In ancient cities, gates were not only for defense but also served as places of commerce and legal transactions. The constant surveillance "day and night" indicates the seriousness of the threat against Saul and the determination of his adversaries. This vigilance mirrors the persistent opposition faced by early Christians, as seen in other parts of Acts where apostles were imprisoned and persecuted (<a href="/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18</a>, <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>).<p><b>in order to kill him.</b><br>The intent to kill Saul underscores the extreme measures the Jewish leaders were willing to take to stop the spread of Christianity. This reflects the broader theme of martyrdom and persecution in the early church, as seen in the stoning of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>). Saul's own later writings, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, recount the numerous dangers and persecutions he faced for the sake of the Gospel. This phrase also foreshadows Saul's future as a key figure in spreading Christianity, despite the constant threats to his life, illustrating the transformative power of Christ and the cost of discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

He does not presume on divine protection; he acts prudently, a pattern echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32-33</a> where he recounts the same escape.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Day and night they watched the city gates</b><p>&#8220;Day and night they watched the city gates &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>b)<p>&#8226; The gates of Damascus were the only legal exit points.

The verse assures believers that while opposition may be relentless, divine protection and purpose are even more certain, propelling the gospel forward through every threat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">They watched the gates day and night to kill him.</span>--A somewhat fuller account of this episode in the Apostle's life is given by him in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:">2Corinthians 11:32</a>. There we read that the governor--literally, <span class= "ital">ethnarch</span>--of the city, under Aretas, King of Arabia Petraea, with Petra as his capital, the father of the wife whom Herod Antipas divorced, in order that he might marry Herodias, took an active part in the plot against Paul. On the manner in which Aretas had gained possession of a city which was properly attached to the Roman province of Syria, see Note on <a href="/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>. It is noticeable that there are coins of Damascus bearing the names of Augustus and Tiberius, and again of Nero and his successors, but none of those of Caligula and Claudius, who succeeded Tiberius. Caligula, on his accession, reversed the policy of Tiberius, who had been a friend and supporter of Antipas against Aretas, and it is probable that, as in other instances, he created a new principality, or ethnarchy, in favour of Aretas, to whose predecessors Damascus had belonged (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 15, ? 2). The ethnarch apparently wished to court the favour of the large Jewish population, and, looking on St. Paul as a disturber of the public peace, took measures for his arrest and condemnation. Troops were stationed at each gate of the city in order to prevent his escape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Their plot</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="accented">became known</span> for <span class="accented">their laying await was known</span>, A.V.; to <span class="accented">Saul</span> for <span class="accented">of Saul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the gates also</span> for <span class="accented">the gates</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">that they might</span> for to, A.V.; a colon instead of full point at end of verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">but</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#973;&#955;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(Saul&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4569.htm">Strong's 4569: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul, the apostle.
