In the context of <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>, the apostles were performing many signs and wonders among the people, leading to increased faith and reverence for their message. The phrase suggests that the actions described are a direct consequence of the apostles' growing influence and the power of the Holy Spirit working through them.<p><b>people brought the sick into the streets</b><br>The act of bringing the sick into the streets reflects the desperation and hope of the people seeking healing. In the ancient world, illness was often seen as a result of sin or spiritual affliction, and public spaces were common venues for seeking healing from renowned figures. This also demonstrates the communal nature of early Christian society, where the well-being of individuals was a shared concern.<p><b>and laid them on cots and mats</b><br>Cots and mats were common items used by the poor and infirm, indicating the socio-economic status of those seeking healing. This detail highlights the inclusivity of the early Christian message, reaching out to the marginalized and needy. The use of such simple items underscores the humility and accessibility of the healing ministry of the apostles.<p><b>so that at least Peter&#8217;s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by</b><br>The belief in the power of Peter's shadow reflects the extraordinary faith of the people in the apostolic authority and the presence of the Holy Spirit. Shadows were often associated with influence and presence in ancient cultures. This act parallels other biblical accounts where physical proximity to a holy person or object resulted in healing, such as the woman touching Jesus' garment in <a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>.

The phrase ties verse 15 directly to God&#8217;s ongoing display of power (<a href="/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>). The gospel&#8217;s advance produces visible change; salvation and healing walk hand-in-hand, confirming that Jesus is alive and working through His people (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>people brought the sick into the streets</b><p>The populace didn&#8217;t wait for an official meeting; they carried their needy friends right into public view. Faith moved them to action, reminiscent of the four men lowering their paralytic friend through a roof to reach Jesus (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3-5</a>). The &#8220;streets&#8221; reveal openness&#8212;God&#8217;s compassion isn&#8217;t confined to temple courts. Just as crowds once spread along village roads to meet Jesus (<a href="/mark/6-56.htm">Mark 6:56</a>), now they assemble for His apostle. The same Lord who healed then still heals now (<a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and laid them on cots and mats,</b><p>&#8220;Cots&#8221; suggests the more affluent could afford lightweight beds; &#8220;mats&#8221; belonged to the poor. Luke, the physician-historian, notes both, underscoring Christ&#8217;s impartial grace (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). Whether paralytics (<a href="/acts/9-33.htm">Acts 9:33</a>) or any other ailment, all found a place. Physical weakness turned into an opportunity for God&#8217;s strength (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that at least Peter&#8217;s shadow might fall on some of them</b><p>This detail shows expectancy.

Earlier, Peter had lifted a lame man &#8220;in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a>). Later, handkerchiefs from Paul would carry healing power (<a href="/acts/19-11.htm">Acts 19:11-12</a>). God sometimes uses unconventional conduits&#8212;Elisha&#8217;s bones (<a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>), a woman touching Jesus&#8217; cloak (<a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43-48</a>)&#8212;so that all credit returns to Him. The shadow points to God&#8217;s presence, echoing <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, where those who dwell &#8220;in the shadow of the Almighty&#8221; find refuge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as he passed by.</b><p>Peter wasn&#8217;t setting up a healing booth; he was simply &#8220;passing by,&#8221; living out daily ministry. God&#8217;s power accompanied normal obedience (<a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32-35</a>). The verb implies continual movement&#8212;the gospel advances, and grace overflows wherever God&#8217;s servants go (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18-19</a>). What mattered was not Peter&#8217;s schedule but God&#8217;s sovereign initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a> records an overflow of faith sparked by undeniable miracles. Crowds placed the sick in city streets, rich and poor alike, longing for even Peter&#8217;s shadow to brush them. The scene showcases:<p>&#8226; the unstoppable impact of Christ&#8217;s risen power working through the apostles,<p>&#8226; a community&#8217;s confident faith that God heals,<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s readiness to meet human need beyond conventional settings, and<p>&#8226; the confirmation that the same Jesus who showed compassion in the Gospels continues His ministry through His church. The verse invites believers today to expectant faith, active compassion, and confidence that God&#8217;s saving and healing work is still alive wherever His people walk.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Insomuch that they</span> <span class= "bld">brought forth the sick . . .</span>--The tense implies habitual action.

All that was wanted was the expectation of an intense faith, as the subjective condition on the one side, the presence of an objective supernatural power on the other, and any medium upon which the imagination might happen to fix itself as a help to faith. So afterwards the "hand, kerchiefs and aprons" from St. Paul's skin do what the shadow of St. Peter does here (<a href="/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>).
