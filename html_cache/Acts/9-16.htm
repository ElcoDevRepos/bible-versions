In the context of <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>, God is speaking to Ananias about Saul (later Paul). The use of "show" implies that God will reveal His plans to Saul, emphasizing the personal relationship and direct communication between God and His chosen instruments. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where God reveals His will to His servants, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and the calling of the prophets (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>).<p><b>how much he must suffer</b><br>The concept of suffering is central to the Christian faith, as it reflects the path of Jesus Christ, who suffered for humanity's redemption. Saul's future suffering is not a punishment but a part of his calling as an apostle. This suffering includes physical persecution, imprisonment, and hardships, as detailed in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>. It highlights the cost of discipleship and the reality of spiritual warfare. The early church faced significant persecution, and Saul's experiences would serve as a testament to his commitment and the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>for My name.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "for My name" signifies the reason and purpose behind Saul's suffering. It is for the sake of Jesus Christ and the proclamation of His name. In biblical terms, a name represents character and authority. Saul's mission is to spread the Gospel and bear witness to the name of Jesus among the Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the call to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Saul's transformation from persecutor to proclaimer underscores the power of Christ's name and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul/paul.htm">Saul/Paul</a></b><br>Originally known as Saul, he was a zealous Pharisee who persecuted Christians.

(<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; This suffering will serve as a refining fire that shapes Paul&#8217;s character (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>) and authenticates his apostleship (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226;
