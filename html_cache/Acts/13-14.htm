It was known for its temple of Artemis and was a significant city in the Roman province. The mention of Perga indicates the missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas as they traveled through Asia Minor. This journey marks the beginning of Paul's first missionary journey, highlighting the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish territories.<p><b>they traveled inland to Pisidian Antioch</b><br>Pisidian Antioch was a Roman colony in the region of Phrygia, not to be confused with the more famous Antioch in Syria. It was strategically located on a major Roman road, the Via Sebaste, which facilitated travel and communication. This city was a center of Roman administration and culture, making it a significant location for spreading the Gospel. The journey from Perga to Pisidian Antioch involved traversing difficult terrain, indicating the missionaries' dedication.<p><b>where they entered the synagogue</b><br>The synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life and a place where the Scriptures were read and discussed. Paul&#8217;s strategy often involved starting his ministry in a new city by preaching in the synagogue, as it provided an audience familiar with the Scriptures. This approach allowed him to connect the message of Jesus to the Jewish understanding of the Messiah.<p><b>on the Sabbath</b><br>The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a day of rest and worship for the Jewish people. By attending the synagogue on the Sabbath, Paul and Barnabas were able to engage with the Jewish community during their regular time of worship and teaching. This timing was strategic for reaching both Jews and God-fearing Gentiles who attended the synagogue.<p><b>and sat down</b><br>Sitting down in the synagogue was a customary position for teaching and discussion. It indicates that Paul and Barnabas were prepared to participate in the service, possibly to listen first and then to speak. This posture reflects a respectful approach to the local customs and an openness to dialogue. It also sets the stage for Paul&#8217;s subsequent opportunity to share the Gospel message, as recorded later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, known for their missionary journeys to spread the Gospel.

It lay on the slopes of Mount Taurus, which the travelers must have crossed, had obtained the "Jus Italicum"--a modified form of Roman citizenship--under Augustus, and had attracted, as the sequel shows, a considerable Jewish population, who had made many proselytes among the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/13-42.htm" title="And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles sought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.">Acts 13:42</a>).

They sat as in the seat of the Rabbi, and their doing so was an indication, as the sequel shows, that they asked for permission to address the congregation. It will be remembered that the organisation of the synagogue excluded the sacerdotal element altogether, and that lay-preaching, assuming a sufficient training, was an established practice.
