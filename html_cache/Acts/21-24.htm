The Nazirite vow was a special commitment to God, often involving abstaining from wine, not cutting one's hair, and avoiding contact with the dead. Paul is advised to join these men to demonstrate his respect for Jewish customs.<p><b>purify yourself along with them</b><br>Purification rituals were common in Jewish tradition, especially for those who had been in Gentile lands, as Paul had been. This act of purification would involve ceremonial washing and possibly offering sacrifices, as outlined in the Mosaic Law. It signifies Paul's willingness to adhere to Jewish customs to maintain peace and unity within the Jerusalem church.<p><b>and pay their expenses</b><br>Paying for the sacrifices required at the end of a Nazirite vow was a significant financial commitment.

Paul, just back from Gentile lands, willingly enters this seven-day process (<a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>). His example teaches that observances rooted in Scripture remain honorable when they do not undermine Christ&#8217;s finished work (compare <a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>, where Paul himself had taken a vow).<p>Key takeaway<p>&#8226; Grace frees us from legalistic fear, yet grace also frees us for respectful cooperation when it serves the gospel (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pay their expenses</b><p>Covering the cost of sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/6-14.htm">Numbers 6:14&#8211;15</a>) was a generous act often done by the well-to-do (Josephus, Antiquities 19.6.1 for King Agrippa I). Paul uses his resources so these brothers can complete their vow. <a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a> reminds us he worked with his own hands; generosity is not limited to the wealthy.<p>Practical angle<p>&#8226; Supporting others&#8217; worship and witness displays the self-giving love of Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so they can have their heads shaved</b><p>The shaving marked fulfillment of a Nazarite vow (<a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18</a>). Public, visible, and communal, it declared gratitude to God. Paul&#8217;s involvement shows respect for the outward sign without trusting in it for salvation&#8212;just as baptism or the Lord&#8217;s Supper today are meaningful symbols when joined with faith (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then everyone will know that there is no truth to these rumors about you</b><p>Rumors said Paul taught Jews to &#8220;abandon Moses&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>). By taking part in a thoroughly Jewish ceremony, Paul offers observable proof to the contrary. <a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a> values a good name; sometimes God calls His servants to dispel falsehood through humble action rather than argument (<a href="/1_peter/2-15.htm">1 Peter 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but that you also live in obedience to the law</b><p>Paul&#8217;s gospel never contradicts the moral law (<a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>). His life shows that faith in Christ fulfills the law&#8217;s righteous requirements (<a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>). Participating in temple rites under the old covenant was acceptable until the temple&#8217;s destruction; what mattered was the motive. For Jewish believers, cultural loyalty and moral obedience could harmonize with faith in Jesus (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>).<p>Guardrails<p>&#8226; Such practices must never be imposed on Gentile believers (<a href="/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Rituals must never replace the sufficiency of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a> showcases Paul&#8217;s flexible love: he gladly joins, purifies, finances, and finishes a Jewish vow to silence slander and advance unity. The verse confirms that gospel freedom and respectful observance can coexist. Paul models how believers, secure in Christ, may lay down personal preferences to build up others and display the unchanging truth of God&#8217;s Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Purify thyself with them . . .</span>--This involved sharing their abstinence for the uncompleted term of the vow, and shaving the head at its conclusion.<p><span class= "bld">Be at charges with them . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">spend money on them.</span> This involved payment (1) for the act of shaving the head, for which probably there was a fixed fee to priest or Levite; (2) for the sacrifices which each Nazarite had to offer--<span class= "ital">sc.,</span> two doves or pigeons, a lamb, an ewe lamb, a ram, a basket of uneavened bread, a meat offering and a drink offering (<a href="/context/numbers/6-9.htm" title="And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.">Numbers 6:9-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- These</span> for <span class="accented">them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for them</span> for <span class="accented">with them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall know</span> for <span class="accented">may know</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there is no truth in the things</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">those things... are nothing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hare been</span> for <span class="accented">were</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">keeping</span> for <span class="accented">and keepest</span>, A.V. As regards the transaction recommended by James, Kypke (quoted by Meyer) says, "It was a received thing among the Jews, and was reckoned an act of eminent piety, for a rich man to undertake to bear, on behalf of poor Nazarites, the expense of those sacrifices which they had to offer when they shaved their heads at the expiration of their vow." Josephus seems to allude to the custom, and to speak of King Agrippa as acting in accordance with it, when he says of him that he ordered great numbers of Nazarites to be shaved ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 6:1). The sacrifices were costly, consisting of" three beasts, one for a burnt offering, another for a sin offering, and a third for a peace offering" (Lightfoot, vol. 9. p. 307). Alexander Jannaeus is said to have contributed nine hundred victims for three hundred Nazarites ('Dict. of Bible,' under "Nazarite;" comp. 1 Macc. 3:49). <span class="cmt_word">Purify thyself</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, the word used in the LXX. of <a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2, 3, 8</a> (with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and co-derivatives <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) for the corresponding Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, to take the Nazarite vow.
