Roman law held jailers accountable for their prisoners, often with their own lives.

In the ancient world, earthquakes were often seen as acts of divine intervention. The open doors symbolize freedom and divine deliverance, reminiscent of Peter's miraculous escape from prison in <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7-10</a>.<p><b>he drew his sword</b><br>The sword was a common weapon for Roman soldiers and guards. The act of drawing his sword indicates the jailer's immediate response to a perceived crisis. In Roman culture, honor was highly valued, and failing in one's duty could lead to severe consequences.<p><b>and was about to kill himself</b><br>Suicide was considered an honorable way to avoid disgrace in Roman society. The jailer likely feared the punishment for allowing prisoners to escape, which could include execution. This reflects the severe accountability Roman guards faced, as seen in <a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>, where Herod executed the guards after Peter's escape.<p><b>presuming that the prisoners had escaped</b><br>The assumption that the prisoners had escaped was logical given the circumstances. However, Paul and Silas, along with the other prisoners, remained, demonstrating their integrity and the power of their witness.

An earthquake has shaken the foundations, yet the jailer had been asleep&#8212;oblivious to the worship and wonder happening right under his roof.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs physical sleep with spiritual unawareness. Just as Jesus told His disciples in Gethsemane, &#8220;Keep watch and pray&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>), the jailer illustrates how quickly crisis can rouse a person to eternal realities.<p>&#8226; The scene proves the literal power of God to interrupt human routine. Like Elijah awakening Israel at Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37&#8211;39</a>), the Lord now jolts this man from slumber so he can meet salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And saw the prison doors open</b><p>&#8226; What his eyes behold is unmistakable: every door stands wide. This is an echo of Peter&#8217;s earlier deliverance&#8212;&#8220;the iron gate leading into the city opened for them by itself&#8221; (<a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; An open door in Scripture often signals divine opportunity (<a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>). Here, God is not merely freeing apostles; He is opening the heart of a pagan jailer (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a> parallels Lydia&#8217;s story).<p>&#8226; No lock or chain can resist the Lord (<a href="/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a>). The physical sight of open doors prepares the jailer to embrace the spiritual door of salvation (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He drew his sword</b><p>&#8226; As a Roman servant of the state, he carried the &#8220;sword&#8221; granted to civil authorities (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>). The weapon intended to enforce order now threatens its bearer.<p>&#8226; His reflex shows how fear&#8212;rather than faith&#8212;rules a heart apart from Christ (<a href="/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>). While Paul and Silas reacted to the earthquake with praise, the jailer responds with panic.<p>&#8226; The contrast signals the difference between those who know the living God and those who do not (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was about to kill himself</b><p>&#8226; Roman law held guards personally liable; failure meant execution (compare <a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>, where Herod kills the soldiers after Peter&#8217;s escape). Facing shame and torture, the jailer chooses suicide.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently upholds the sanctity of life; self-harm never aligns with God&#8217;s will (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19&#8211;20</a>). His despair underscores humanity&#8217;s need for a Savior who conquers both external chains and internal hopelessness (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment also highlights the urgency of divine intervention. Just as the angel stopped Abraham&#8217;s knife over Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-10.htm">Genesis 22:10&#8211;12</a>), Paul&#8217;s shout in the next verse will halt the jailer&#8217;s fatal act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Presuming that the prisoners had escaped</b><p>&#8226; He makes a natural assumption: open doors mean empty cells. <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> warns, &#8220;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His presumption ignores God&#8217;s unseen work. Miraculously, every prisoner remains (<a href="/acts/16-28.htm">Acts 16:28</a>). The same power that flung doors wide held hearts steady, demonstrating that freedom in Christ is not lawless but ordered by love (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The jailer&#8217;s false conclusion sets the stage for true revelation: instead of losing prisoners, he will gain eternal life (<a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30&#8211;34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a> records the split-second when a hardened official awakens to disaster, leaps to the wrong conclusion, and stands on the brink of self-destruction. God uses an earthquake, open doors, and imminent suicide to expose the emptiness of human security and the futility of fear. The scene prepares both the jailer and the reader to witness how the gospel turns death into life, despair into joy, and a prison into a house of worship&#8212;proving once more that our sovereign Lord &#8220;opens and no one will shut&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">He drew out his sword, and would have killed himself.</span>--We have seen in <a href="/acts/12-19.htm" title="And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.

Here the man sought to anticipate his fate. Suicide was a natural resource under such conditions everywhere, but here there was a local predisposing influence. Philippi, after the great battle in which Brutus and Cassius had been defeated by Antonius, had been conspicuous for the number of those who had thus preferred death to the abandonment of the Republic and the loss of freedom.
