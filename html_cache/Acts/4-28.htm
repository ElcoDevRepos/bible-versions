It highlights the human responsibility and involvement in the events leading to Jesus' death. The phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan through human actions, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph acknowledges God's purpose in his brothers' actions.<p><b>what Your hand and will</b><br>The "hand" of God is a biblical metaphor for His power and authority. It signifies God's active involvement in the world and His ability to bring about His purposes. The "will" of God refers to His divine plan and purpose. This phrase emphasizes the belief in God's sovereignty and providence, suggesting that nothing happens outside of His control. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, and in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, which speaks of God working all things according to the counsel of His will.<p><b>had decided beforehand</b><br>This indicates the doctrine of predestination, where God, in His omniscience, has foreordained events before they occur. It reflects the belief that the crucifixion of Jesus was not an accident but a predetermined part of God's redemptive plan. This concept is supported by prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretells the suffering of the Messiah, and by Jesus' own predictions of His death and resurrection in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p><b>would happen</b><br>The phrase confirms the certainty and inevitability of God's plan being fulfilled. It reassures believers of the reliability of God's promises and the unfolding of His redemptive history. This is seen in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah and in the New Testament's assurance of future events, such as the return of Christ (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>). The crucifixion, though carried out by human hands, was ultimately the fulfillment of God's salvific purpose, demonstrating His control over history and His commitment to redeem humanity through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign planner whose will and hand orchestrate events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the divine plan, whose life, death, and resurrection were foreordained.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_and_pontius_pilate.htm">Herod and Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>Rulers who played roles in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus, acting within God's predetermined plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>Early Christian leaders who are praying and acknowledging God's sovereignty in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events unfolded, significant in both Jewish and Christian history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, both past and present.

The verse magnifies His sovereign power, underscores mankind&#8217;s accountability, and assures believers that no enemy can overturn what God has already decided for our salvation and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">To do whatsoever</span> <span class= "bld">thy hand</span>. . . .--The great problem of the relation of the divine purpose to man's free agency is stated (as before in <a href="/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>), without any attempt at a philosophical solution. No such solution is indeed possible. If we admit a Divine Will at all, manifesting itself in the government of the world, in the education of man kind, in the salvation of individual souls, we must follow the example of the Apostle, and hold both the facts of which consciousness and experience bear their witness, without seeking for a logical formula of reconciliation. In every fact of history, no less than in the great fact of which St. Peter speaks, the will of each agent is free, and he stands or falls by the part he has taken in it; and yet the outcome of the whole works out some law of evolution, some "increasing purpose," which we recognise as we look back on the course of the events, the actors in which were impelled by their own base or noble aims, their self-interest or their self-devotion. As each man looks back on his own life he traces a sequence visiting him with a righteous retribution, and leading him, whether he obeyed the call, or resisted it, to a higher life, an education no less than a probation. "Man proposes, God disposes." "God works in us, therefore we must work." Aphorisms such as these are the nearest approximation we can make to a practical; though not a theoretical, solution of the great mystery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - To do <span class="accented">for</span> for <span class="accented">to do</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">foreordained to come to pass</span> for <span class="accented">determined before to be done</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To do</span> (for the sentiment, comp. <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>).
