The early church was closely knit, and communication was vital for maintaining doctrinal unity. This awareness suggests a network of communication among the early Christians, possibly through letters or messengers, which was crucial for addressing issues promptly.<p><b>that some went out from us</b><br>The individuals mentioned here were originally part of the Jerusalem church, indicating that they had some level of authority or influence. This reflects the early church's struggle with maintaining doctrinal purity as it expanded. The phrase suggests a breach of trust, as these individuals acted independently of the church's leadership.<p><b>without our authorization</b><br>This highlights the importance of apostolic authority in the early church. The apostles were seen as the primary leaders and guardians of the faith, and their endorsement was crucial for any teaching or mission. This unauthorized action underscores the need for discernment and accountability within the church, as seen in other New Testament passages like <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, where Paul warns against false gospels.<p><b>and unsettled you</b><br>The term "unsettled" indicates that the actions of these individuals caused confusion and disturbance among the believers. This reflects the vulnerability of the early church to false teachings and the importance of sound doctrine. The church in Antioch, where this issue arose, was a diverse community of Jewish and Gentile believers, making it particularly susceptible to doctrinal disputes.<p><b>troubling your minds</b><br>The phrase "troubling your minds" suggests a deep level of distress and confusion. This is not merely a theological disagreement but something that affects the believers' peace and assurance. The early church faced many such challenges, as seen in Paul's letters, where he often addresses issues of false teaching and its impact on believers' faith and unity.<p><b>by what they said</b><br>The content of the false teaching is implied here, likely related to the necessity of following Jewish law for salvation, as seen earlier in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. This reflects the broader conflict in the early church regarding the role of the Mosaic Law for Gentile converts. The Jerusalem Council, which this letter addresses, was convened to resolve such issues, emphasizing the need for clear and authoritative teaching in the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

The teachers who bade the Gentiles keep the Law were reminded in that Epistle that they, in their servile respect of persons, were breaking the Law deliberately in one point, and were therefore guilty of all.
