His wisdom is reminiscent of Solomon's, who was also endowed with divine wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). The inability of Stephen's opponents to counter his arguments underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>, where He assured His followers that He would give them words and wisdom that none of their adversaries would be able to resist or contradict. This wisdom is not merely human intellect but is divinely inspired, reflecting the Holy Spirit's work in the early church.<p><b>or the Spirit by whom he spoke</b><br>The reference to "the Spirit" indicates the Holy Spirit's active role in empowering Stephen. This aligns with <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would empower His disciples to be His witnesses. The Spirit's presence in Stephen's speech is a testament to the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>) about the outpouring of the Spirit in the last days. The Holy Spirit's guidance is evident throughout Acts, as seen in the apostles' boldness and the miraculous signs accompanying their ministry. Stephen's speech, filled with the Spirit, serves as a type of Christ, who also spoke with authority and wisdom that confounded His opponents (<a href="/matthew/22-46.htm">Matthew 22:46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen to serve the early church, known for his faith and the Holy Spirit's power.

Their arguments fell flat, their logic unraveled. Why?<p>&#8226; Jesus had promised, &#8220;I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>). This moment fulfills that promise in real time.<p>&#8226; Just as the authorities were &#8220;amazed&#8221; and &#8220;recognized that [Peter and John] had been with Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>), Stephen&#8217;s Christ-formed confidence left them speechless.<p>&#8226; Opposition to God&#8217;s truth never ultimately prevails (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>); when God defends His servant, human cleverness is no match.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To His Wisdom</b><p>Stephen&#8217;s wisdom was more than sharp reasoning; it was Spirit-saturated insight that pointed every issue back to Christ.<p>&#8226; James describes heavenly wisdom as &#8220;pure&#8230;peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>). Those very qualities characterized Stephen&#8217;s defense in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.<p>&#8226; Like Solomon, to whom God said, &#8220;I have given you a wise and discerning heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), Stephen received wisdom as a divine gift, not a human achievement.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a> urges believers to &#8220;act wisely toward outsiders.&#8221; Stephen models that principle, using wisdom to open doors for the gospel rather than to win an academic duel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or the Spirit</b><p>His adversaries were not merely facing a gifted speaker; they were confronting the Holy Spirit Himself.<p>&#8226; Jesus had explained, &#8220;It will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>). <a href="/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a> records that very dynamic.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a> notes that Peter, &#8220;filled with the Holy Spirit,&#8221; spoke with boldness; here the same Spirit empowers Stephen. Different men, same divine source.<p>&#8226; When the Spirit moves, conviction pierces even hardened hearts (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>). The inability of the council to refute Stephen reveals more about their resistance to God than about any rhetorical shortcoming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By Whom He Spoke</b><p>Every word Stephen uttered flowed from intimate fellowship with the Spirit.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a> shows the pattern: &#8220;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak&#8230;&#8221; What began at Pentecost continues here.<p>&#8226; Paul later reminds Timothy, &#8220;God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>). Stephen&#8217;s courage embodies that power.<p>&#8226; This dependence on the Spirit is the hallmark of effective witness (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>): &#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a> illustrates the unbeatable combination of Spirit-given wisdom and Spirit-empowered speech. Stephen&#8217;s opponents could not overturn his arguments because they were really resisting God Himself. The verse calls believers to rely on that same Spirit, trusting that when we speak His truth with His wisdom, no opposition can ultimately stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">They were not able.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">had no strength;</span> the verb being somewhat more forcible than that commonly translated "to be able."<p><span class= "bld">To resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spake.</span>--It is remarkable that Stephen is the first Christian teacher of whom "wisdom" is thus specially predicted. In the Gospels it is ascribed to our Lord (<a href="/matthew/13-54.htm" title="And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?">Matthew 13:54</a>; <a href="/luke/2-40.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>); and we read of "the wisdom of Solomon" (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm" title="The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.">Matthew 12:42</a>). In a writer like St. Luke, it implies something higher even than the "consolation" or "prophecy" from which Barnabas took his name--wider thoughts, a clearer vision of the truth, the development of what had been before latent in hints and parables and dark sayings. The speech that follows in the next chapter, may be accepted as an example, as far as circumstances allowed, of the method and power of his general teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Withstand</span> for <span class="accented">resist</span>, A.V.
