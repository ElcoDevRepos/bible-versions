Paul, a Jew himself, was often misunderstood by Jewish believers who thought he was advocating for the abandonment of Jewish law. The phrase "Jews who live among the Gentiles" refers to the Jewish diaspora, Jews living outside of Israel, who were often more integrated into Gentile culture. This misunderstanding reflects the broader conflict in the early church about the role of the Mosaic Law for Jewish and Gentile believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>to forsake Moses</b><br>"Moses" here symbolizes the Mosaic Law, which was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. The accusation that Paul was teaching Jews to forsake Moses was serious, as it implied abandoning the covenantal relationship with God established through the Law. This reflects the struggle within the early church to define the relationship between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ. Paul himself, in his letters, clarifies that he does not oppose the Law but sees it fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>).<p><b>telling them not to circumcise their children</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>) and a critical aspect of Jewish identity. The claim that Paul was teaching against circumcision was a significant charge, as it suggested a break from the covenant with Abraham. In <a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>, Paul argues that circumcision is not necessary for salvation, emphasizing faith in Christ over adherence to the Law. This reflects the theological shift from physical signs of the covenant to spiritual faith in Christ.<p><b>or observe our customs</b><br>"Customs" refers to the various Jewish traditions and laws that governed daily life, including dietary laws, Sabbath observance, and festival celebrations. The early church grappled with whether Gentile converts needed to adopt these customs, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. Paul's teaching emphasized that salvation through Christ was not dependent on these customs, aligning with the decision of the Jerusalem Council that Gentiles were not bound by the entirety of the Mosaic Law. This phrase underscores the cultural and religious challenges faced by the early church in integrating diverse believers into one body.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage, accused of teaching Jews to abandon Mosaic Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_and_the_jerusalem_elders.htm">James and the Jerusalem Elders</a></b><br>Leaders of the Jerusalem church who are addressing concerns about Paul's teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews_among_the_gentiles.htm">Jews among the Gentiles</a></b><br>Jewish believers living in Gentile regions, who are the subject of the accusations against Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Represents the Mosaic Law, which includes circumcision and other Jewish customs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this meeting takes place, a central hub for early Christianity and Jewish tradition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_context.htm">Understanding Context</a></b><br>Recognize the cultural and religious tensions in the early church between Jewish traditions and the new covenant in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_tradition_and_faith.htm">Balancing Tradition and Faith</a></b><br>While traditions can be valuable, they should not overshadow the core message of the Gospel, which is salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/addressing_misunderstandings.htm">Addressing Misunderstandings</a></b><br>Misunderstandings about faith practices can arise; it is crucial to address them with clarity and love, as seen in the dialogue between Paul and the Jerusalem elders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The early church faced challenges in maintaining unity amidst diverse practices.

Similar misunderstandings surface in <a href="/acts/16-2.htm">Acts 16:2&#8211;3</a>, where Paul actually circumcises Timothy to avoid offense, showing he was not hostile to Jewish identity. In <a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>, thousands of believing Jews are &#8220;all zealous for the Law,&#8221; so any hint that Paul opposes Moses alarms them. Misperceptions about gospel messengers are nothing new&#8212;see <a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11&#8211;18</a> when Paul and Barnabas are mistaken for gods. The lesson: rumors must be weighed against proven character and Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles</b><p>Paul&#8217;s primary field was the dispersion, the &#8220;Jews who live among the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13&#8211;14</a>). He preached in synagogues first (<a href="/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; 17:1&#8211;2), honoring Israel&#8217;s priority in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The charge assumes Paul&#8217;s influence is sweeping, but also paints a picture of faithful diaspora Jews wrestling with cultural pressures. Paul never denied Jewish believers their heritage; instead he affirmed his own lineage (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>) and continued synagogue engagement (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4</a>). His consistent pattern was:<p>&#8226; Proclaim Messiah as fulfillment of the Law and Prophets (<a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Clarify salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Encourage unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to forsake Moses</b><p>The accusation: Paul urges Jews to &#8220;forsake Moses.&#8221; Yet Paul declares, &#8220;Do we, then, abolish the Law through faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the Law&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>). Jesus Himself said He came not to abolish but to fulfill (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). Paul&#8217;s teaching consistently points to:<p>&#8226; The Law as tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The Law&#8217;s righteous requirements met in believers who walk by the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>).<p>Thus, far from encouraging abandonment, Paul reveals Moses&#8217; ultimate purpose&#8212;driving sinners to the Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>telling them not to circumcise their children</b><p>Circumcision, instituted in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10&#8211;14</a>, became the flashpoint of <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. The Jerusalem Council concluded Gentiles need not adopt it for salvation (<a href="/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19&#8211;20, 28</a>&#8211;29). However, it never prohibited Jewish believers from continuing the practice. Paul&#8217;s stance:<p>&#8226; Salvation is not dependent on circumcision (<a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Fleshly signs cannot replace heart transformation (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; He personally circumcised Timothy for witness&#8217; sake (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>), proving flexibility, not rejection.

Paul did not forbid Jewish customs; he opposed demanding them of Gentiles or treating them as salvific.

Scripture shows Paul upheld the Law&#8217;s purpose, valued Jewish identity, and respected customs&#8212;while insisting justification comes only through faith in Jesus. The verse highlights the perennial tension between tradition and gospel liberty and calls believers to verify rumors, cherish heritage, and keep Christ central.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And they are informed of thee . . .</span>--This, it is clear, was the current version of St. Paul's teaching. How far was it a true representation of its tendencies? As a personal accusation it was, of course, easy to refute it. His rule of adaptation led him to be to the Jews as a Jew (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>). He taught that every man, circumcised or uncircumcised, should accept his position with its attendant obligations (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-18.htm" title="Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.">1Corinthians 7:18-20</a>). He had himself taken the Nazarite vow (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>), and had circumcised Timotheus (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). It was probably false that he had ever taught that Jews "ought not to circumcise their children." But fanaticism is sometimes clear-sighted in its bitterness, and the Judaisers felt that when it was proclaimed that "circumcision was nothing," in its bearing on man's relations to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), it ceased to have a <span class= "ital">raison d'etre, </span>and sank to the level of a mere badge of the national exclusiveness, which, in its turn, was assailed by St. Paul's teaching that all middle walls of partition were broken down (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and that Jews and Gentiles were alike one in Christ. If a Jew had asked, Why then should I circumcise my child? it would not have been easy to return a satisfying answer. If it were said, "To avoid giving offence," that was clearly only temporary and local in its application, and the practice would die out as people ceased to be offended. If it were urged that it was a divine command, there was the reply that, as a command, it had been virtually though not formally repealed when the promises and privileges connected with it were withdrawn. It was the seal of a covenant (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>), and could hardly be looked upon as binding when the covenant itself had been superseded. Few Christians would now hold that a converted Jew was still bound to circumcise, as well as baptise, his children. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews did but push St. Paul's teaching to its legitimate conclusions when he said that the "new covenant had made the first old," and that "that which is decaying and waxing old is ready to vanish away" (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- Have been</span> for <span class="accented">are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">telling them not</span> for <span class="accented">saying that they ought not</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Have been informed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>, etc. The verb properly means to instruct by word of mouth, whence our "catechism." <span class="cmt_word">The customs</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>, both for the phrase and the sentiment, and <a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, note; Acts 26:3; 28:17. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a favorite word of St. Luke's, occurring ten times in his Gospel and in the Acts, and only twice in the New Testament elsewhere (<a href="/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; see Hobart, on <a href="/luke/2-27.htm">Luke 2:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they are under the impression</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#967;&#942;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kat&#275;ch&#275;th&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2727.htm">Strong's 2727: </a> </span><span class="str2">To instruct orally, teach, inform.
