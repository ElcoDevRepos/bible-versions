The context is a tense situation where Paul is being advised on how to address concerns among Jewish believers who are zealous for the law. The elders' advice is meant to demonstrate Paul's respect for Jewish customs, despite his mission to the Gentiles. This reflects the early church's struggle to balance Jewish traditions with the new covenant in Christ. The use of "we advise you" suggests a collective decision, emphasizing the importance of unity and counsel within the church leadership.<p><b>There are four men with us</b><br>The mention of "four men" indicates a specific group within the Jerusalem church. These men are likely Jewish Christians who are still observing traditional Jewish practices. The number four may not have specific symbolic significance here, but it underscores the communal aspect of the vow they have taken. This reflects the early church's diversity, where Jewish customs were still practiced by some believers. The presence of these men with the elders suggests their involvement in a communal religious act, highlighting the continued observance of Jewish customs among early Christians.<p><b>who have taken a vow.</b><br>The vow referred to is likely a Nazirite vow, as described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. This vow involved abstaining from wine, not cutting one's hair, and avoiding contact with the dead, as a sign of dedication to God. The completion of such a vow often included a purification ritual and offering sacrifices at the temple. This practice was a way for Jewish Christians to express their piety and commitment to God. The mention of the vow indicates the ongoing relevance of Jewish customs in the early church and Paul's willingness to participate in them to maintain peace and unity among believers. This act can be seen as a type of Christ's fulfillment of the law, as Paul seeks to bridge the gap between Jewish tradition and the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/21.htm">Acts 21</a>.

They celebrate God&#8217;s work among the Gentiles, yet recognize tension among Jewish believers who hear rumors that Paul teaches Jews to abandon Moses (<a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do what we advise&#8221; signals pastoral wisdom aimed at preserving unity (cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The elders are not questioning Paul&#8217;s doctrine of grace&#8212;settled earlier at the Jerusalem Council (<a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10-11, 19</a>-21)&#8212;but are seeking a practical, peace-keeping step.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s willingness echoes his own words: &#8220;I have become all things to all people, so that by all possible means I might save some&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Submission here is voluntary, not coerced; it models <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>, &#8220;So then, let us pursue what leads to peace and to mutual edification.&#8221;<p>The call to humble flexibility for the sake of weaker brothers remains timeless (<a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There are four men with us who have taken a vow</b><p>The elders propose that Paul publicly join four Jewish believers completing a vow&#8212;almost certainly a Nazirite vow described in <a href="/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>.<p>&#8226; Such vows involved temporary abstinence, ritual purity, and a concluding sacrifice (<a href="/numbers/6-13.htm">Numbers 6:13-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul himself had earlier observed a vow (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>), showing that Old Covenant symbols could still serve devotional purposes without compromising the gospel.<p>&#8226; By paying the purification expenses (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>), Paul would demonstrate respect for the Law, quiet rumors, and underscore that faith in Christ does not forbid culturally meaningful practices when rightly understood (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-18.htm">1 Corinthians 7:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; This action parallels his circumcision of Timothy &#8220;because of the Jews who lived in that area&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>), yet he refused to circumcise Titus when it would distort the gospel (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3-5</a>). Discernment is key: Paul accommodates for love, never for legalistic bondage.<p>&#8226; The elders&#8217; suggestion also protects the church&#8217;s witness in Jerusalem, reflecting Paul&#8217;s own principle: &#8220;Give no offense to Jews or Greeks or the church of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23</a> records a wise pastoral proposal: Paul, submit to a harmless Jewish rite with four men under vow, showing you honor God&#8217;s Law while preaching salvation by grace. The verse models humble flexibility that values unity, silences unfounded criticism, and keeps the focus on the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">We have four men which have a vow on them.</span>--The advice was eminently characteristic. (1) It came from one who himself lived as bound by the Nazarite vow. "No razor came upon his head, and he drank neither wine nor strong drink" (Hegesippus in Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 23). By connecting himself with such a vow St. Paul would show that he was content in these matters to follow in the footsteps of St. James, that he looked upon the observance of the Nazarite vow, if not as binding, at any rate as right and praise worthy. (2) It is obvious that St. Paul's conduct on his last visit to Jerusalem had furnished a precedent for the line of action now recommended. He had then come as a Nazarite himself; had in that character burnt the hair which he had cut off at Cenchreae (see Note on <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>), and had offered the accustomed sacrifices. Why should he not repeat the process now? There was, however, this difficulty: the minimum period of the Nazarite vow was for thirty days, and as St. Paul had not taken the vow previous to the advice, and probably wished to leave Jerusalem soon after the feast was over (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>), it was out of his power to fulfil it now in its completeness. Jewish usage, however, made an intermediate course feasible. A man might attach himself to a Nazarite, or company of Nazarites, join in the final process of purification, which lasted, probably, for seven days (<a href="/numbers/6-9.htm" title="And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.">Numbers 6:9</a>), shaving his head, and offering sacrifices with them. This was considered in itself a devout act, especially if the new comer defrayed the cost of the sacrifices. Agrippa I., for instance, had in this way gained credit with the Jews, as showing his reverence for the Law (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 15, ? 1). It is clear that the four men were members of the Church of Jerusalem, and the fact is interesting as showing how intensely Jewish that church still was in its observances.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which have a vow</span>; meaning emphatically the vow of a Nazarite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
