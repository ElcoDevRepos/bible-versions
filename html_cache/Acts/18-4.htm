The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a time when Jews gathered for worship and teaching, providing Paul with a ready audience familiar with the Scriptures.<p><b>he reasoned in the synagogue</b><br>Paul's method of reasoning indicates a dialogical approach, engaging in discussions and debates. This was a common practice in synagogues, where the Scriptures were read and interpreted. Paul's reasoning would have involved explaining and proving that Jesus is the Messiah, using the Hebrew Scriptures as his foundation (<a href="/acts/17-3.htm">Acts 17:3</a>).<p><b>trying to persuade</b><br>The term "persuade" suggests that Paul's efforts were not merely informational but aimed at convincing his listeners to accept Jesus as the Messiah. This reflects the apostolic mission to make disciples by appealing to both the mind and heart, urging a response of faith and repentance.<p><b>Jews and Greeks alike</b><br>Paul's audience in the synagogue included both Jews and God-fearing Greeks. The presence of Greeks indicates the influence of Hellenistic culture and the openness of some Gentiles to Jewish teachings. This aligns with the broader mission to bring the gospel to all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The inclusion of Greeks also foreshadows the expanding reach of the gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage, known for his missionary journeys and efforts to spread the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>A Jewish place of worship and community gathering where Paul often began his ministry in a new city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The primary audience in the synagogue, who were familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures and awaited the Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/greeks.htm">Greeks</a></b><br>Non-Jews who were also present in the synagogue, often referred to as God-fearers or proselytes, showing interest in the Jewish faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, known for its diverse population and significant commercial activity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reasoning_in_faith.htm">The Importance of Reasoning in Faith</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s method of reasoning in the synagogue highlights the importance of engaging the mind in matters of faith.

Other reminders:<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek&#8230; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Even a synagogue leader, Crispus, believed&#8212;along with many Corinthians (<a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>).<p>Paul&#8217;s inclusiveness highlighted the church&#8217;s expanding mission, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; command to make disciples &#8220;of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4</a> pictures a servant of Christ who, every Sabbath, faithfully entered the synagogue, reasoned from Scripture, and sought to persuade both Jews and Greeks.

But taken by itself, the vow would seem to have involved a continuous growth of hair rather than cropping it. How was that act connected with the vow? A probable answer to the question is found in the Apostle's language as to social customs in matters of this kind, in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1Corinthians 11:14</a>. He condemns long hair as effeminate. But the Nazarite vow led to long hair as its natural consequence, and there was, therefore, the risk that while practising a rigorous austerity, he might seem to outside observers to be adopting an unmanly refinement. At Corinth men would, perhaps, know what his act meant, but in the regions to which he was now going it was wise to guard against the suspicion by a modification of the vow, such as Jewish law allowed.<p>Cenchreae was, as has been said, the eastern harbour of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf. <a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a> indicates the existence of an organised Church there. The warm language of gratitude in which St. Paul speaks of Ph?be, the deaconess of the Church there, is best explained by supposing that she had ministered to him as such when he was suffering from bodily pain or infirmity, and this, in its turn, may afford another probable explanation of the vow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Jews and Greeks</span> for <span class="accented">the Jews and the Greeks</span>, A.V.
