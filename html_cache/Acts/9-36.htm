It is one of the oldest functioning harbors in the world and was historically significant as a gateway for trade and travel. In biblical times, Joppa was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>). It is also the place where Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). The city's location made it a melting pot of cultures and a strategic location for the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>there was a disciple named Tabitha</b><br>Tabitha is identified as a disciple, indicating her commitment to following Jesus Christ. The term "disciple" is used here to denote a female follower of Christ, highlighting the inclusive nature of the early Christian community. Tabitha's role as a disciple underscores the active participation of women in the early church, as seen in other New Testament passages (e.g., <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1-2</a>, where Phoebe is mentioned as a deacon).<p><b>(which is translated as Dorcas)</b><br>The name Tabitha is Aramaic, while Dorcas is the Greek equivalent, both meaning "gazelle." The use of both names suggests that she was known in both Jewish and Greek circles, reflecting the cultural diversity of the early church. The gazelle is often associated with grace and beauty, which may metaphorically describe her character and the impact of her ministry.<p><b>who was always occupied with works of kindness and charity</b><br>Tabitha's life was marked by her dedication to good works and acts of charity, embodying the Christian call to love and serve others (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>). Her actions reflect the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the needy (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). This phrase highlights the practical outworking of faith through service, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament. Her example serves as a model for Christian living, demonstrating that true discipleship involves active compassion and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabitha/dorcas.htm">Tabitha/Dorcas</a></b><br>A disciple in Joppa known for her good works and acts of charity.

The town stood on a hill so high that it was said (though this is not in conformity with the fact) that Jerusalem could be seen from its summit.
