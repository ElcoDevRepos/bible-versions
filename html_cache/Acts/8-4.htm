This dispersion is known as the "Diaspora" and is significant in the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish boundaries. Historically, this scattering fulfilled Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." The scattering was not merely a result of persecution but also a divine strategy for the dissemination of the Gospel.<p><b>preached the word</b><br>Despite the adversity they faced, the scattered believers continued to proclaim the Gospel. This phrase highlights the resilience and commitment of early Christians to their mission. The "word" refers to the message of Jesus Christ, His death, and resurrection, which is central to Christian faith. This preaching aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructed His followers to make disciples of all nations. The act of preaching amidst persecution demonstrates the transformative power of the Gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers.<p><b>wherever they went</b><br>This indicates the geographical spread of the Gospel message. The early Christians did not limit their preaching to familiar or comfortable areas but took the message to new regions and cultures. This phrase underscores the universal nature of the Gospel, breaking cultural and ethnic barriers. It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching "to the ends of the earth." The movement of these believers laid the groundwork for the establishment of churches in various parts of the Roman Empire, as seen in the subsequent missionary journeys of Paul and others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scattered_believers.htm">The Scattered Believers</a></b><br>These were early Christians who fled Jerusalem due to persecution following the martyrdom of Stephen.
