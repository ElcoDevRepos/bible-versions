This famine is a fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as seen in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, where Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dreams predicting seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. The geographical regions of Egypt and Canaan are significant as they were central to the narrative of the patriarchs. Egypt, with its Nile River, was typically a place of refuge during famines, while Canaan was the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. The famine's impact on both regions underscores the widespread nature of the crisis and sets the stage for the Israelites' eventual migration to Egypt.<p><b>and our fathers could not find food</b><br>The phrase "our fathers" refers to the patriarchs, specifically Jacob and his sons, who were the forefathers of the Israelite nation. Their inability to find food in Canaan during the famine is a pivotal moment that leads to their journey to Egypt, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/42.htm">Genesis 42</a>. This event is crucial in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as it leads to the preservation of Jacob's family and the eventual growth of the Israelites into a great nation. The lack of food also serves as a test of faith and reliance on God's provision, foreshadowing future instances where God's people would depend on Him for sustenance, such as during the Exodus. This narrative also typologically points to Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life, who provides spiritual nourishment and sustenance to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food that affected both Egypt and Canaan, causing widespread suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant location in biblical history, where Joseph rose to power and where the Israelites later became enslaved.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to Abraham and his descendants, which was also affected by the famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/our_fathers.htm">Our Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarchs of Israel, particularly Jacob and his sons, who were directly impacted by the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, Joseph's earlier actions in Egypt were crucial in providing a solution to the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>The famine was a part of God's larger plan to bring the Israelites to Egypt, where they would grow into a great nation.

That single word, &#8220;Then,&#8221; places us at a precise historical moment: after Joseph&#8217;s rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39&#8211;45</a>) yet before the reunion of Jacob&#8217;s family. Scripture always moves in real time and space, anchoring God&#8217;s redemptive work in literal events (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- The connective &#8220;then&#8221; reminds us that God orchestrates history in a definite sequence. Joseph&#8217;s earlier trials, exaltation, and preparation of grain stockpiles were no accident (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Because God is sovereign over timing, we can trust His timetable for our own lives (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>famine and great suffering</b><p>- The famine was not a mere economic downturn; it involved widespread physical anguish. <a href="/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a> notes, &#8220;He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food&#8221;.<p>- God sometimes uses hardship to push His people toward His larger purposes. In this case, the crisis became the means by which Israel would relocate to Egypt, fulfilling God&#8217;s covenant promise to Abraham about a sojourn in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p>- For believers today, seasons of &#8220;great suffering&#8221; can likewise serve as divine catalysts, nudging us toward places of provision, growth, or ministry we would otherwise resist (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>swept across Egypt and Canaan</b><p>- The famine was regional, striking both Egypt and Canaan simultaneously (<a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a>).<p>- Egypt&#8212;typically supplied by the Nile&#8212;was usually insulated from Canaan&#8217;s droughts. That the famine overwhelmed both nations underscores God&#8217;s comprehensive control over nature (<a href="/job/37-10.htm">Job 37:10-13</a>).<p>- By affecting Egypt too, the Lord elevated Joseph&#8217;s role. His God-given plan to store grain (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>) turned Egypt into the only refuge for surrounding peoples, prefiguring Christ, who alone provides the bread of life for all nations (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and our fathers could not find food</b><p>- &#8220;Our fathers&#8221; points to the patriarchs&#8212;Jacob and his sons&#8212;showing continuity between Stephen&#8217;s generation and the original covenant family (<a href="/acts/7-19.htm">Acts 7:19</a>; <a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>).<p>- <a href="/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1-2</a> records Jacob&#8217;s alarm: &#8220;When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, &#8216;Why are you staring at one another?&#8217; &#8230; &#8216;Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die&#8217; &#8221;.<p>- Their inability to secure food in Canaan forced them toward reconciliation with Joseph and relocation to Goshen (<a href="/genesis/45-9.htm">Genesis 45:9-11</a>). God often removes lesser securities so that His people will seek His appointed salvation (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>; <a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-11.htm">Acts 7:11</a> highlights God&#8217;s sovereign timing (&#8220;Then&#8221;), His purposeful use of hardship (&#8220;famine and great suffering&#8221;), the wide-reaching scope of His providence (&#8220;swept across Egypt and Canaan&#8221;), and His loving intent to draw His covenant people into the place of provision when human resources fail (&#8220;our fathers could not find food&#8221;). The verse is a snapshot of redemptive history in motion, assuring us that the same faithful God still turns crises into conduits of blessing for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11-14) <span class= "bld">Now there came a dearth . . .</span>--So far as we can trace the sequence of thought, there seems the suggested inference that as those who, in the history of Joseph, had persecuted him, came afterwards to be dependent on his bounty, so it might prove to be, in the last parallel which the history of Israel presented.
