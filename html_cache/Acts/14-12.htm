Zeus was the chief deity in the Greek pantheon, often associated with power and authority. The people of Lystra, witnessing the miraculous healing performed by Paul and Barnabas, interpreted these acts through their cultural lens, attributing divine status to Barnabas. This reflects the common practice of deifying individuals who exhibited extraordinary abilities or characteristics. The choice of Barnabas as Zeus may suggest that he had a commanding presence or demeanor that resonated with their understanding of Zeus.<p><b>and Paul they called Hermes</b><br>Hermes, in Greek mythology, was the messenger of the gods, known for his eloquence and communication skills. Paul, being the primary speaker and preacher, naturally fit this role in the eyes of the Lystrans. This identification highlights Paul's role as the spokesperson for the Gospel, emphasizing his ability to articulate and convey the message of Christ effectively. The cultural context here shows how the Lystrans tried to make sense of the apostles' message by aligning it with their own religious framework.<p><b>because he was the chief speaker</b><br>Paul's role as the chief speaker underscores his leadership in the missionary journey and his gift of preaching. This aligns with other scriptural accounts where Paul is depicted as a powerful orator and teacher (e.g., <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>). His ability to communicate the Gospel was instrumental in the spread of Christianity. The distinction between Barnabas and Paul in this passage also reflects the early church's recognition of diverse gifts and roles within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A prominent leader in the early Christian church, known for his encouragement and support of Paul.

The main reason for the assignment of the two names was that the listeners recognised in St. Paul the gift of eloquence, which was the special attribute of Hermes. Possibly, also, unlike as were the weak bodily presence and the many infirmities of the Apostle to the sculptured grace with which we are familiar as belonging to the sandalled messenger of the gods--young, and beautiful, and agile--there may have been something in the taller stature and more stately presence of Barnabas which impressed them with the sense of a dignity like that of Jupiter. In any case, we must remember that the master-pieces of Greek art were not likely to have found their way to a Lycaonian village, and that the Hermes of Lystra may have borne the same relation to that of Athens and Corinth as the grotesque Madonna of some Italian wayside shrine does to the masterpieces of Raphael. Real idolatry cares little about the aesthetic beauty of the objects of its worship; and the Lycaonians were genuine idolaters.<p><span class= "bld">The chief speaker.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the ruler of speech</span>--taking the chief part in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Mercury</span> for <span class="accented">Mercurius</span>, A.V.
