The act of falling to the ground signifies a response to a powerful, supernatural presence, often seen in biblical theophanies (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>). It indicates reverence, fear, and the overwhelming nature of God's glory. This moment marks a pivotal transformation in Saul's life, leading to his conversion and subsequent mission as Paul the Apostle.<p><b>and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew</b><br>The use of Hebrew here emphasizes the personal and direct nature of God's communication with Saul. Hebrew, the sacred language of the Jewish people, underscores the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and His ongoing revelation. This detail highlights Saul's Jewish heritage and the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, connecting the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>&#8216;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of Saul's name signifies urgency and personal address, a common biblical motif (e.g., <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>). The question reveals the intimate connection between Jesus and His followers, as persecuting Christians equates to persecuting Christ Himself. This reflects the unity of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>) and emphasizes the seriousness of Saul's actions against the early Church.<p><b>It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase uses an agricultural metaphor familiar to the ancient audience. Goads were sharp sticks used to direct oxen, and kicking against them would cause pain. The metaphor suggests Saul's resistance to God's will is futile and self-destructive. It implies divine sovereignty and the inevitability of God's plan, echoing themes of submission and transformation found throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>). Saul's conversion illustrates the transformative power of God's grace and the call to align with His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul/paul.htm">Saul/Paul</a></b><br>Originally known as Saul, he was a zealous Pharisee who persecuted Christians.

Here there is no doubt as to the genuineness of the reading.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Saying unto me in the Hebrew language</span> for <span class="accented">speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">goad</span> for <span class="accented">pricks</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I heard a voice saying</span>, etc. (see <a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">In the Hebrew language</span>. This is an additional detail not mentioned in <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a> or <a href="/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8</a>; but recalled here, as tending to confirm St. Paul's claim to be a thorough Jew, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and, moreover, to represent Christianity as a thing not alien from, but rather in thorough harmony with, the true national life and spirit of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">It is hard for thee to kick</span>, etc. This, also, according to the best manuscripts, is an additional detail not mentioned before. The proverb <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to kick against the ox-goads, as the unbroken bullock does to his own hurt, instead of quietly submitting, as he must do at last, to go the way and the pace his master chooses he should go, is found in Pindar, AEschylus, Euripides, Plautus, Terence, etc. The <span class="accented">passages</span> are given in Bochart, 'Hierozoicon.,' part 1. lib. it. Acts 39; in Kninoel, and in Bishop Wordsworth. The passage in Eurip., 'Baach,' 1. 793, 794 (750, 751), brings out the force of the proverb, viz. fruitless resistance to a superior power, most distinctly: "<span class="accented">Better</span> to sacrifice to him, than, being mortal, by vainly raging against God, to kick against the goads." Saul had better yield at once to the constraining grace of God, and no longer do despite to the Spirit of grace. It does not appear clearly that the proverb was used by the Hebrews. Dr. Donaldson ('Christian Orthodoxy,' p. 293) affirms that" there is no Jewish use of this proverbial expression." And this is borne out by Lightfoot, who adduces the two passages, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>, as the only evidences of the existence of such a proverb, together with a rabbinical saying, "R. Bibai sat and taught, and R. Isaac Ben Cahna kicked against him" ('Exereit. on <span class="accented">Acts</span>,' <span class="accented">9:</span>5). It is, therefore, a curious question how this classical phrase came to be used here. Bishop Wordsworth <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Even</span> in heaven our Lord did not disdain to use a proverb familiar to the heathen world." But, perhaps, we may assume that such a proverb was substantially in use among the Jews, though no distinct evidence of it has been preserved; and that St. Paul, in rendering the Hebrew words of Jesus into Greek, made use of the language of Euripides, with which he was familiar, in a case bearing a strong analogy to his own, viz. the resistance of Pentheus to the claims of Bacchus. This is to a certain extent borne out by the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>; <a href="/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9</a>); the latter of which is twice used in the 'Bacchae' of Euripides, though not common elsewhere. It is, however, found in 2 Macc. 7:19. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/26-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
