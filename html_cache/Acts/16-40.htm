Their imprisonment was marked by a miraculous event where an earthquake opened the prison doors, yet they chose not to escape, leading to the conversion of the jailer and his household (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-34</a>). This act of integrity and faithfulness highlights the power of God working through His servants, even in dire circumstances.<p><b>they went to Lydia&#8217;s house</b><br>Lydia was a prominent figure in the early church at Philippi, known for her hospitality and support of Paul&#8217;s ministry. She was a seller of purple goods, indicating her wealth and status (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>). Her home likely served as a meeting place for the fledgling church, providing a safe haven for believers. This reflects the early Christian practice of meeting in homes for worship and fellowship, as seen in other parts of the New Testament (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>).<p><b>to see the brothers and encourage them</b><br>The term "brothers" refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond within the early Christian community. Paul and Silas&#8217;s visit to encourage them underscores the importance of mutual support and edification among Christians, a theme prevalent throughout Paul&#8217;s letters (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>). Encouragement was vital for the early church, often facing persecution and challenges.<p><b>Then they left the city</b><br>After fulfilling their mission in Philippi, Paul and Silas departed, continuing their missionary journey. This departure signifies the transient nature of their ministry, as they were led by the Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel across various regions (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-4</a>). Their leaving also reflects the strategic approach of establishing churches and then moving on, trusting the local believers to continue the work (<a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle and missionary, Paul is a central figure in the New Testament, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

This models how believers may appeal to rightful authority while trusting the Lord&#8217;s vindication (<a href="/acts/25-10.htm">Acts 25:10-11</a>).<p>- The scene reminds us that persecution never thwarts God&#8217;s plans (<a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19-20</a>); instead, it often becomes the platform for greater witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They went to Lydia&#8217;s house</b><p>- Lydia, the first convert in Philippi, had opened her home earlier: &#8220;If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>). Her house now functions as the meeting place for the young church, just as Priscilla and Aquila&#8217;s home did in Rome (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>).<p>- This underscores the New Testament pattern of hospitable, house-based gatherings (Philemon 2), where fellowship grows in a family setting.<p>- Lydia&#8217;s generosity also illustrates <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>: &#8220;Show hospitality to one another without complaining.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To see the brothers</b><p>- &#8220;Brothers&#8221; embraces the entire congregation&#8212;men and women united in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).

Paul later reminds the Thessalonians how he &#8220;longed to see you face to face&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17-18</a>).<p>- Spiritual family ties are real and lasting, forged by the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>); checking on one another is normal Christian life (<a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And encourage them</b><p>- Fresh from miraculous deliverance, Paul and Silas share testimonies that spur faith (<a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>).<p>- &#8220;Encourage&#8221; means strengthening hearts and urging perseverance, exactly what they did on earlier journeys (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>).<p>- The pattern continues throughout Paul&#8217;s ministry: &#8220;Therefore encourage one another and build each other up&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>).<p>- Notice the order: they encourage before departing, ensuring the believers are spiritually fortified for whatever opposition might follow (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they left the city</b><p>- Having confirmed the fledgling church is stable, the missionaries move on to Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1</a>). This shows a balance of care and mission momentum (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>- Departure is not abandonment; it entrusts the church to God&#8217;s ongoing grace (<a href="/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>) and to local leadership the apostles had cultivated.<p>- Their exit also fulfills Jesus&#8217; instruction to carry the gospel from place to place when a season of ministry closes (<a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a> reveals a fourfold rhythm: God rescues His servants, believers gather in hospitable homes, leaders personally strengthen the flock, and the mission advances to new fields.

As the third person is now resumed, we may infer that St. Luke remained at Philippi, Timothy accompanying the other two. It would seem from <a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a> that the Evangelist made Philippi the centre of his evangelising work for many years. Under the care of the beloved physician, the good work went on, and we may probably trace to his influence, and to Lydia's kindness, the generous help which was sent to St. Paul once and again when he was at Thessalonica (<a href="/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15-16</a>), and, probably, at Corinth also (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). Long years afterwards he cherished a grateful memory of the men and women who had laboured with him at Philippi. Among these we may think of the Clement, of whom he thus speaks, possibly identical with the Flavius Clemens, who occupies a prominent position among the apostolic fathers, and was traditionally the third Bishop of Rome. (See, however, Note on <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Departed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from Philippi, according to the magistrates' request in ver. 39.

It appears from the first verse of <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. ("<span class="accented">they</span> had passed," etc.) that St. Luke stopped at Philippi, and probably made it his head-quarters till St. Paul's last journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem, some six or seven years later (<a href="/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a>). What became of Timothy we are not expressly told, only we find him at Beroea in <a href="/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; and at Corinth (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).
