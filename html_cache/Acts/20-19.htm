This humility is reflective of Christ's own example (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). Paul's ministry was not about self-promotion but about glorifying God and serving others (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>). His humility is evident in his willingness to endure hardships and his focus on the needs of the church rather than his own.<p><b>and with tears</b><br>The mention of tears indicates Paul's deep emotional investment in his ministry and the people he served. It reflects his compassion and the burdens he carried for the churches (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>). Tears also signify the genuine love and concern he had for the spiritual well-being of others, echoing Jesus' own weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><b>especially in the trials that came upon me</b><br>Paul faced numerous trials throughout his ministry, including physical hardships, persecution, and opposition (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>). These trials were a testament to his commitment to the gospel and his willingness to suffer for Christ's sake (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>). The trials also served to strengthen his faith and reliance on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p><b>through the plots of the Jews</b><br>Paul often encountered opposition from Jewish leaders who saw his message as a threat to their religious authority and traditions (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>, <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>). This opposition was rooted in a misunderstanding of the fulfillment of the Law through Christ (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>). The plots against Paul highlight the tension between the early Christian movement and traditional Jewish beliefs, as well as the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The primary speaker in this passage, Paul is addressing the Ephesian elders, recounting his ministry and the challenges he faced.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A significant city in Asia Minor where Paul spent considerable time preaching and teaching, establishing a strong Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to certain Jewish individuals or groups who opposed Paul's message and sought to undermine his ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_elders.htm">The Ephesian Elders</a></b><br>Leaders of the church in Ephesus, whom Paul is addressing in this farewell speech.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trials_and_plots.htm">Trials and Plots</a></b><br>The various challenges and conspiracies Paul faced, particularly from those who opposed his mission to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Paul exemplifies serving the Lord with humility.
