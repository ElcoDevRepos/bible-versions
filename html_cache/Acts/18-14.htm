This moment highlights his readiness to give a defense, as instructed in <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>. The setting is Corinth, a major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant trade routes, which made it a strategic location for spreading the Gospel.<p><b>Gallio told the Jews</b><br>Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, a Roman province. His role was to oversee legal matters, and his decision carried significant weight. Gallio's involvement indicates the legal and political challenges faced by early Christians. His brother, Seneca, was a famous philosopher, which may have influenced Gallio's approach to governance. The Jews here refer to the Jewish leaders who opposed Paul's teachings, a recurring theme in Acts.<p><b>If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime</b><br>Gallio distinguishes between religious disputes and criminal offenses. Roman law was concerned with maintaining public order, and Gallio's statement reflects the Roman perspective on legal matters. This distinction is crucial as it sets a precedent for how Roman authorities would handle conflicts involving Christians, emphasizing that the early church was not seen as a threat to Roman law.<p><b>O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint</b><br>Gallio addresses the Jewish leaders directly, acknowledging their concerns but also setting boundaries for his jurisdiction. This reflects the Roman practice of allowing local customs and religions to coexist as long as they did not disrupt public order. Gallio's response is significant because it demonstrates a level of religious tolerance and sets a legal precedent that would impact the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

Paul&#8217;s heart always leans toward clear testimony.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a> urges every believer, &#8220;Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope you possess.&#8221;. Paul models that readiness.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is evident: He need not always use our words; sometimes He turns hearts or circumstances before we speak (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gallio told the Jews</b><p>&#8226; Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia, speaks with civic authority; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a> explains that &#8220;rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Gallio&#8217;s impartial stance protects Paul&#8217;s freedom to keep preaching, illustrating how God can use secular officials to advance His purposes, just as He used Cyrus long before (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a> reminds us God &#8220;determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands&#8221; so people might &#8220;seek Him.&#8221; Gallio&#8217;s presence at this moment fits that larger plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews</b><p>&#8226; Gallio distinguishes between genuine civil crime and religious disagreement.<p>&#8226; His words echo Pilate&#8217;s verdict on Jesus: &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against this man.&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Similarly, Festus later admits of Paul, &#8220;They did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/25-18.htm">Acts 25:18</a>). Roman officials repeatedly find no civil offense in gospel ministry, underscoring its blameless character (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Gallio&#8217;s mention of &#8220;vicious crime&#8221; signals Rome&#8217;s concern with public order; the gospel, when lived rightly, threatens no such order (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint</b><p>&#8226; By Roman standards, only clear violations of law merited the court&#8217;s attention.

Proper legal channels exist, but they aren&#8217;t for settling doctrinal disputes.<p>&#8226; Gallio&#8217;s stance unwittingly safeguards religious liberty, allowing Paul to remain and strengthen the church at Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a> &#8211; &#8220;There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD.&#8221;. Human courts cannot hinder God&#8217;s mission when He chooses to advance it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul stands ready to defend the gospel, yet God turns the situation before he speaks, using Gallio&#8217;s commitment to Roman justice to protect His servant. Gallio properly separates civil crime from religious debate, finds no wrongdoing, and dismisses the charge. The episode highlights God&#8217;s sovereign care, the believer&#8217;s call to blameless living, and the legitimacy of civil authority when it functions as God designed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">When Paul was now about to open his mouth.</span>--The phrase always implies, as has been noticed (see Note on <a href="/acts/8-35.htm" title="Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.">Acts 8:35</a>), the beginning of a set discourse. St. Paul was about to begin a formal <span class= "ital">apologia.</span> This, however, proved to be unnecessary.<p><span class= "bld">Gallio said unto the Jews.</span>--The proconsul could hardly have resided in Achaia for eighteen months without hearing of the new movement. He knew the Jews. He probably knew something of St. Paul. On the assumption already referred to (see Note on <a href="/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>) the knowledge may have been fuller than appears on the surface. In any case, from his standpoint, as philosopher and statesman, it was not a matter for his tribunal. He was not anxious to draw a hard and fast line as to the <span class= "ital">relligiones licitae</span> recognised by the State.<p><span class= "bld">A matter of wrong or wicked lewdness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a matter of crime or fraud.</span> "Lewdness," which to us suggests a special class of crimes, is used as "lewd" had been in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>. The Greek word is very closely connected with that translated "subtlety" in <a href="/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>. Both words were probably used in a strictly forensic sense--the first for acts of open wrong, such as robbery or assault; the second for those in which a fraudulent cunning was the chief element.<p><span class= "bld">Reason would that I should bear with you.</span>--The very turn of the phrase expresses an intense impatience. Even in the case supposed, his tolerance would have required an effort. As it was, these Jews were now altogether intolerable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">about</span> for <span class="accented">now about</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">if indeed</span> for <span class="accented">if</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of wicked villainy</span> for <span class="accented">wicked lewdness</span>, A.V.
