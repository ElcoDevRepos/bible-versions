This setting highlights the intellectual and cultural significance of Athens, known for its philosophers like Socrates and Plato. Paul's presence here indicates the importance of his message, as he addresses a group known for their pursuit of wisdom and debate. The Areopagus was a place where new ideas were examined, making it a fitting location for Paul to present the gospel.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Men of Athens,</b><br>Addressing the "Men of Athens" directly, Paul acknowledges his audience, which likely included philosophers, scholars, and city leaders. Athens was a center of learning and culture in the ancient world, renowned for its contributions to philosophy, art, and democracy. By engaging with the Athenians, Paul demonstrates his willingness to meet people where they are, using their cultural context as a starting point for his message.<p><b>I see that in every way you are very religious.</b><br>Paul observes the Athenians' religiosity, noting their numerous altars and temples dedicated to various gods. This statement is both an acknowledgment of their spiritual awareness and a subtle critique of their idolatry. The Athenians' religious practices reflect a deep-seated desire to understand the divine, yet they lack the knowledge of the one true God. Paul's approach is strategic, as he uses their existing beliefs as a bridge to introduce the gospel. This method aligns with his broader missionary strategy of becoming "all things to all people" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>) to win them to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and missionary who is speaking to the Athenians.

The Court sat in the open air on benches forming three sides of a quadrangle. A short flight of sixteen steps, cut in the rock, led from the <span class= "ital">agora</span> to the plateau where the Court held its sittings. If it was actually sitting at the time, the temptation to have recourse to it, if only to cause a sensation and terrify the strange disputant, may well have been irresistible. As the Apostle stood there, he looked from the slight elevation on the temple of the Eumenides below him, that of Theseus to the east, and facing him on the Acropolis, the Parthenon. On the height of that hill stood the colossal bronze statue of Athena as the tutelary goddess of her beloved Athens, below and all around him were statues and altars. The city was "very full of idols."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Areopagus</span> for <span class="accented">Mars</span> <span class="accented">hill</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in all things I perceive that</span> for <span class="accented">I perceive that in all things</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">somewhat</span> for <span class="accented">too</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst</span> is simply a local description.

There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether these words imply praise or blame. Chrysostom, followed by many others, takes it as said in the way of encomium, and understands the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, very religious, more than commonly religious. And so Bishop Jacobson ('Speaker's Commentary'), who observes that the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is used five times by Josephus, and always in the sense of "religion," or "piety." On the other hand, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">superstitiosiores</span>), the English Versions, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, etc., take the word in its most common classical sense of "superstitious;" and it weighs for something towards determining St. Luke's use of the word that Plutarch uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> always in a bad sense, of superstition, as in his life of Alexander and elsewhere, and in his tract 'De Superstitione' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). Perhaps the conclusion is that St. Paul, having his spirit stirred by seeing the city full of idols, determined to attack that spirit in the Athenian people which led to so much idolatry; which he did in the speech which follows. But, acting with his usual wisdom, he used an inoffensive term at the outset of his speech. He could not mean to praise them for that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> which it was the whole object of his sermon to condemn.
