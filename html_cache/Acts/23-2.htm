Paul had declared that he had lived his life with a clear conscience before God. This statement provoked a reaction from the high priest. The context is a tense and hostile environment, as Paul is on trial for his teachings about Jesus Christ, which were controversial and divisive among Jewish leaders.<p><b>the high priest Ananias</b><br>Ananias was the high priest from approximately AD 47 to 59. He was known for his quick temper and harshness. Historical records, such as those by Josephus, describe him as a corrupt and violent leader, which aligns with his reaction to Paul. The role of the high priest was significant in Jewish society, serving as the chief religious authority and a political leader under Roman rule.<p><b>ordered those standing near Paul</b><br>This indicates the presence of temple guards or attendants who were responsible for maintaining order during proceedings. The high priest had the authority to command these individuals, reflecting the hierarchical structure of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin was the supreme council and tribunal of the Jews during post-exilic times, composed of 71 members, including the high priest.<p><b>to strike him on the mouth</b><br>Striking someone on the mouth was a sign of rebuke and disrespect, often used to silence or punish someone for perceived blasphemy or insolence. This act was contrary to Jewish law, which required a fair trial and due process. The action foreshadows the suffering and persecution that Paul, like Jesus, would endure for his testimony. It also echoes Jesus' own experience when He was struck during His trial (<a href="/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>), highlighting the parallel between the experiences of Christ and His apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus.

The son of Nebedaeus was conspicuous for his cruelty and injustice, and had been sent to Rome as a prisoner to take his trial before Claudius (A.D. 52). He had been acquitted, or at least released, and had returned to Judaea. To him this assertion of a life so utterly unlike his own seemed almost like a personal insult. He fitted the cap, and raged with a brutal cruelty which reminds us of Jeffreys' treatment of Baxter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ananias</span>, the son of Nebedaeus, successor of Joseph the son of Camel, or Camydus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 1:3; 5:2), appears to have been actually high priest at this time. He was a violent, haughty, gluttonous, and rapacious man, and vet looked up to by the Jews ("tres considere," Renan). He had probably lately returned from Rome, having been confirmed, as it seems, in his office by Claudius, to whom Quadratus, the predecessor of Felix, has sent him as a prisoner, to answer certain charges of sedition against him. He seems to have been high priest for the unusually long period of over ten years - from A.D. to A.D. (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 5:2; 6:2, 3; 8:8). But, on the other hand, Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:5) speaks of a certain <span class="accented">Jonathan</span> being high priest during the government of Felix, and being murdered by the Sicarii at his instigation; which looks as if Ananias's high priesthood had been interrupt el. It would appear, too, from 20. 8:8, that Ismael the son of Fabi succeeded to Jonathan, net to Ananias, as is usually supposed. But the question is involved in great obscurity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
