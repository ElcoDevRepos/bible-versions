This power was not of human origin but was a divine enablement, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus promised the Holy Spirit would empower His followers. The Greek word for "power" here is "dynamis," which is also used in <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a> to describe the miracles of Jesus, indicating a continuation of His ministry through the apostles.<p><b>the apostles continued to give their testimony</b><br>The apostles were eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and their testimony was foundational to the early church's growth. This testimony was not a one-time event but an ongoing proclamation, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32 and 3</a>:15. The Greek word for "testimony" is "martyria," which later came to mean "martyrdom," reflecting the cost of their witness.<p><b>about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus</b><br>The resurrection was central to the apostles' message, as it validated Jesus' claims and demonstrated His victory over sin and death. This event fulfilled Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The resurrection was a cornerstone of apostolic preaching, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>, where Paul argues that without it, faith is futile.<p><b>And abundant grace was upon them all</b><br>The phrase indicates the favor and blessing of God resting on the apostles and the early church community. This grace enabled them to endure persecution and continue their mission. The concept of grace is central to the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift of grace. The communal aspect of grace here suggests a shared experience of God's favor, fostering unity and generosity among believers, as described in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage, the apostles were the early leaders of the Christian church, tasked with spreading the message of Jesus Christ.
