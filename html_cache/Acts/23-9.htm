The setting is the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, where Paul is being tried. The clamor signifies the deep-seated conflict between the Pharisees and Sadducees, two prominent Jewish sects with differing beliefs, particularly regarding the resurrection and spiritual beings.<p><b>and some scribes from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply</b><br>The scribes were experts in the Law and often aligned with the Pharisees, who believed in the resurrection, angels, and spirits. Their sharp contention suggests a vigorous defense of Paul, likely because his teachings on the resurrection aligned more closely with Pharisaic beliefs. This moment highlights the internal divisions within the Jewish leadership and the strategic use of these divisions by Paul to his advantage.<p><b>&#8220;We find nothing wrong with this man.</b><br>This declaration by the Pharisees echoes similar statements made about Jesus during His trials, where no fault was found in Him by Pilate (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). It underscores the innocence of Paul in the eyes of some Jewish leaders and foreshadows the eventual recognition of the gospel's truth by some within Judaism.<p><b>What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?&#8221;</b><br>The Pharisees' openness to the possibility of divine communication through spirits or angels reflects their doctrinal beliefs, contrasting with the Sadducees, who denied such phenomena. This question suggests a willingness to consider Paul's vision on the road to Damascus as a legitimate divine encounter, similar to angelic visitations in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>).

They are, however, wanting in many of the best MSS. and versions, and were apparently added to complete the sentence which St. Luke had left in the emphasis of its unfinished abruptness. Possibly its close was drowned in the tumultuous cries of the Sadducees. The line taken by the Pharisees is altogether that of Gamaliel. After twenty-five years they have not got further than the cautious policy of those who halt between two opinions. They give a verdict of "Not Guilty" as to the specific charges brought against St. Paul. They think it possible that he may have received a vision or revelation of some kind. In the word "spirit" they perhaps admit that the form of Jesus may have appeared to him as a spectre from the world of the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Clamor</span> for <span class="accented">cry</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">some of the</span> for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the Pharisees</span> <span class="accented">part</span> for <span class="accented">that were of the, e</span>tc., A.V.; <span class="accented">stood up</span> for <span class="accented">arose</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and what</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel</span> for <span class="accented">a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him</span>, A.V.; the R.T. omits the clause in the T.R., <span class="accented">let us not fight against God. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The scribes</span> (comp. <a href="/luke/20-39.htm">Luke 20:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We find no evil in this man</span> (comp. <a href="/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29, 33</a>; <a href="/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14, 15, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What if a spirit</span>, etc.; alluding to what Paul had said in <a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17, 18</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A great</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(megal&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">Large, great, in the widest sense. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">clamor</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#965;&#947;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(kraug&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2906.htm">Strong's 2906: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) a shout, cry, clamor, (b) outcry, clamoring against another.
