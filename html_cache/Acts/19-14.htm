Sceva is identified as a Jewish chief priest, though there is no historical record of a chief priest by this name, suggesting he may have been a self-proclaimed leader or part of a lesser-known priestly family. The sons' actions reflect a common practice in the ancient world where exorcism and magical practices were prevalent, especially in Ephesus, a city known for its interest in magic and the occult.<p><b>a Jewish chief priest</b><br>The title "chief priest" suggests a position of religious authority within the Jewish community. However, the lack of historical evidence for Sceva as a recognized chief priest raises questions about his legitimacy. This highlights the tension between genuine spiritual authority and self-appointed positions. The Jewish context is significant, as it shows the intersection of Jewish religious practices with the surrounding Greco-Roman culture, which often included syncretism and the blending of religious traditions.<p><b>were doing this</b><br>The phrase "were doing this" refers to the practice of attempting to invoke the name of Jesus to perform exorcisms, as described in the preceding verses. This action underscores the growing reputation of Jesus' name and the power associated with it, even among those outside the Christian faith. The sons of Sceva's attempt to use Jesus' name without a true relationship with Him serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of using spiritual power for personal gain or without genuine faith. This incident also contrasts with the authentic miracles performed by Paul, emphasizing the importance of true faith and divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_sons_of_sceva.htm">Seven Sons of Sceva</a></b><br>These were Jewish exorcists who attempted to invoke the name of Jesus to cast out evil spirits.

(See Notes on <a href="/matthew/21-15.htm" title="And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,">Matthew 21:15</a>; <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>.) It is hardly probable, however, that one in that position would have taken to this disreputable calling, and it seems more likely that the title itself was part of the imposture. He called himself a chief priest, and as such St. Luke, or Tyrannus, described him. The scene is brought vividly before us. The seven exorcists, relying partly, we may believe, in the mystical virtue of their number, stand face to face with a demoniac, frenzied and strong like the Gadarene of <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>; <a href="/context/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:">Mark 5:3-4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - A <span class="accented">chief priest</span> for <span class="accented">and chief of the priests</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">so</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A chief priest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); not, of course, in the sense of <span class="accented">high priest</span>, but in that wider sense of the word which comprised the chiefs of the twenty-four courses and the members of the Sanhedrim and all who had ever been high priests or who were of the kindred of the high priest (see <a href="/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15</a>; 23:45, etc.; <a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; <a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>, etc.; <a href="/acts/4-23.htm">Acts 4:23</a>; <a href="/acts/5-24.htm">Acts 5:24</a>; <a href="/acts/9-14.htm">Acts 9:14, 21</a>, etc.).
