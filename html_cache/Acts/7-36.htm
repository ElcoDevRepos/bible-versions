This is a pivotal moment in Israelite history, symbolizing deliverance and God's faithfulness. Moses is seen as a type of Christ, a deliverer who prefigures Jesus leading His people out of bondage to sin. The Exodus is a foundational narrative for understanding God's covenant relationship with His people.<p><b>and performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt</b><br>The wonders and signs refer to the ten plagues that God brought upon Egypt, demonstrating His power over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh. These acts were both judgments against Egypt and signs of God's sovereignty. The plagues culminated in the Passover, which prefigures Christ's sacrificial death as the Lamb of God. The plagues served to authenticate Moses' leadership and God's authority.<p><b>at the Red Sea</b><br>The crossing of the Red Sea is a miraculous event where God parted the waters, allowing the Israelites to escape Pharaoh's pursuing army. This event is a powerful demonstration of God's deliverance and protection. It is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from death to life, from slavery to freedom. The destruction of the Egyptian army signifies God's victory over the forces of oppression.<p><b>and for forty years in the wilderness</b><br>The forty years in the wilderness were a period of testing and reliance on God. During this time, God provided for the Israelites with manna, quail, and water, teaching them dependence on Him. This period is symbolic of the Christian journey of faith, characterized by trials and growth. The wilderness experience also foreshadows Jesus' own forty days in the wilderness, where He was tempted but remained faithful. The number forty often signifies a period of testing or judgment in the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Moses is the leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

The words express different relations, it may be, of the same phenomena, rather than phenomena specifically different;--the first emphasising the wonder which the miracle produces, and therefore answering more strictly to that word; the latter, the fact that the miracle is a token or evidence of something beyond itself.
