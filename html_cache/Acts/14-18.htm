The crowd, witnessing this miraculous event, began to believe that the apostles were gods in human form. Despite their efforts to correct this misunderstanding, the apostles faced significant challenges in redirecting the crowd's beliefs. This phrase highlights the difficulty of countering deeply ingrained pagan beliefs and the power of miraculous signs to sway public opinion. It also underscores the importance of clear communication in ministry.<p><b>Paul and Barnabas</b><br>These two apostles were key figures in the early Christian church, known for their missionary journeys and spreading the gospel to the Gentiles. Paul, formerly Saul of Tarsus, was a Pharisee who converted to Christianity after an encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. Barnabas, whose name means "son of encouragement," was instrumental in introducing Paul to the other apostles and was known for his generosity and leadership. Their partnership exemplifies the collaborative nature of early Christian missions.<p><b>could hardly stop the crowds</b><br>The phrase indicates the intensity of the crowd's reaction and the apostles' struggle to prevent them from acting on their mistaken beliefs. This reflects the cultural context of Lystra, where the event took place, a city steeped in Greco-Roman religious practices. The crowd's fervor demonstrates the challenge of introducing monotheistic beliefs in a polytheistic society. It also illustrates the apostles' commitment to truth, as they worked tirelessly to redirect the crowd's worship from themselves to the one true God.<p><b>from sacrificing to them</b><br>The crowd's intention to offer sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas as gods (specifically, they thought Barnabas was Zeus and Paul was Hermes) shows the syncretism prevalent in the ancient world, where divine and human realms often intersected in people's beliefs. Sacrifices were a common religious practice, intended to appease or honor deities. This incident echoes other biblical accounts where humans are mistakenly revered, such as in <a href="/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25-26</a>, where Peter refuses worship from Cornelius. It also foreshadows the ongoing struggle the early church faced in distinguishing the worship of God from the veneration of human leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and theological contributions to Christianity.

Luke is highlighting that, despite everything that has just happened, something unexpected persists. Earlier in the chapter Paul had healed a crippled man (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8&#8211;10</a>), and the locals concluded the missionaries were gods. &#8220;Even&#8221; shows that what follows stands in stubborn opposition to the truth Paul and Barnabas have just proclaimed. Similar tension appears when Moses performs signs yet Pharaoh remains hard-hearted (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3&#8211;4</a>), underscoring how miracles alone do not guarantee right response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with these words</b><p>&#8220;These words&#8221; point back to Paul&#8217;s impassioned plea: &#8220;Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>). Paul&#8217;s message mirrors Peter&#8217;s reaction when Cornelius fell at his feet: &#8220;Stand up; I too am a man&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-26.htm">Acts 10:26</a>). It also echoes the angel&#8217;s correction to John: &#8220;Worship God!&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8&#8211;9</a>). The words were clear, truthful, and rooted in Scripture&#8217;s insistence that only the living God deserves worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). Yet clarity of speech does not always secure obedience of heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul and Barnabas</b><p>Luke intentionally names the missionaries again to stress their humanity. They are servants, not saviors. When Herod accepted worship as a god, judgment fell instantly (<a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21&#8211;23</a>). Paul and Barnabas, by contrast, model humility and point all glory to Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>). Their reaction is a practical application of the First Commandment and a reminder that faithful leaders deflect adoration toward the Lord alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>could hardly stop</b><p>The expression underlines how difficult it is to turn people from idolatry once their hearts are set. This struggle parallels Elijah&#8217;s contest with the prophets of Baal: despite fire from heaven, many still clung to false gods (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37&#8211;39</a>). It also foreshadows Paul&#8217;s later grief when crowds in Ephesus riot over the gospel undermining their Artemis trade (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23&#8211;28</a>). Spiritual blindness resists even the most earnest correction (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the crowds</b><p>The term recalls the volatility of public opinion seen throughout Scripture: the same masses who hailed Jesus later shouted &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18&#8211;21</a>). Crowds can be swayed by emotion, tradition, or sensationalism rather than truth. Paul will warn Timothy about people who accumulate teachers to suit their own desires (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>). The Lystrans&#8217; reaction shows the danger of letting popular sentiment dictate belief instead of God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from sacrificing to them</b><p>Sacrifice belongs exclusively to God (<a href="/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5&#8211;7</a>). Offering it to men, angels, or idols is blasphemy. Paul&#8217;s anguish reflects the righteous jealousy of God, who alone is worthy to receive offerings (<a href="/psalms/96-7.htm">Psalm 96:7&#8211;8</a>). This attempted sacrifice exposes a core human sin: exchanging the glory of the immortal God for images or people (<a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22&#8211;25</a>). The verse thus warns against any form of misplaced worship&#8212;whether ancient pagan rituals or modern celebrity adulation within the church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-18.htm">Acts 14:18</a> captures the stubborn pull of idolatry: even after clear preaching and earnest pleading, Paul and Barnabas can &#8220;hardly stop&#8221; the people from treating them as gods. The verse teaches that miracles and persuasive words, though powerful, cannot by themselves break a heart&#8217;s inclination to worship something other than the one true God. Only the Spirit&#8217;s work brings genuine repentance. For believers today, the passage urges humble vigilance&#8212;redirecting every trace of honor back to the Lord and refusing to let anything or anyone, including ourselves, occupy the throne that belongs to Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">with these sayings scarce restrained they the people.</span>--On some of those who were thus restrained the effect may well have been that they were roused to a higher life and did turn from "vanities" to the living God. We must, at any rate, think of St. Paul's work at Lystra as lasting long enough to allow time for the foundation of a church there. Among the more conspicuous converts were the devout Jewesses, Lois and her daughter Eunice (more accurately, <span class= "ital">Eunike</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the young Timotheus (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2Timothy 1:5</a>). No mention is made of his father, and Eunice may have been a widow; but the fact that the boy had grown up uncircumcised rather suggests the influence of a living father. (See Note on <a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- The multitudes</span> for <span class="accented">the people</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from doing</span> for <span class="accented">that they had not done</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">with these</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">words,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(legontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Paul and Barnabas] could hardly stop</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#960;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katepausan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2664.htm">Strong's 2664: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and pauo; to settle down, i.e. to colonize, or to desist.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
