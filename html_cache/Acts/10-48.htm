The "he" refers to Peter, one of Jesus' apostles, who had just witnessed the Holy Spirit descending upon Cornelius and his household, who were Gentiles. This event is pivotal because it demonstrates that the gift of the Holy Spirit and the call to baptism are not limited to Jews but are extended to all who believe in Jesus Christ. Baptism "in the name of Jesus Christ" signifies the authority and power of Jesus, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This act of baptism also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God declares that His salvation will reach the ends of the earth. The inclusion of Gentiles is a type of the universal reach of Christ's salvation, breaking down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>.<p><b>Then they asked him to stay for a few days.</b><br>This request for Peter to stay indicates the desire for further teaching and fellowship, reflecting the early Church's emphasis on discipleship and community. The hospitality shown by Cornelius and his household is consistent with the cultural norms of the time, where guests were often invited to stay and share in the life of the host. This period of staying together would have allowed for deeper instruction in the faith, as well as the strengthening of the bonds between Jewish and Gentile believers. It also underscores the transformative power of the Gospel, as Peter, a Jew, stays with Gentiles, which would have been culturally and religiously unconventional. This act of staying together symbolizes the breaking down of barriers and the unity found in Christ, as echoed in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who plays a central role in the early church.

The verb &#8220;ordered&#8221; underscores apostolic authority and the non-negotiable nature of baptism for new believers (compare <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/acts/8-36.htm">Acts 8:36&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; Baptism, taken at face value, is an outward, literal immersion symbolizing union with Christ in His death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3&#8211;4</a>). There is no hint of delay; obedience follows faith immediately.<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the name of Jesus Christ&#8221; highlights that salvation and identification are found exclusively in Him (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). It also affirms that Gentiles do not need to adopt Jewish rites to belong; Christ alone is sufficient (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; This act publicly seals the truth that &#8220;God shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>), fulfilling the Great Commission mandate to &#8220;make disciples of all nations, baptizing them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding baptism after the Spirit has already come, Peter demonstrates that water baptism does not confer salvation but testifies to it, harmonizing with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they asked him to stay for a few days.</b><p>&#8226; The new believers invite Peter to remain, showing immediate fellowship and the breaking down of long-standing Jewish-Gentile barriers (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Staying provides time for foundational teaching: &#8220;They devoted themselves to the apostles&#8217; teaching&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>). Young Christians need sound doctrine and personal guidance (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Hospitality cements unity within the body (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>; <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>). Peter&#8217;s acceptance of their invitation demonstrates practical repentance from prejudice and models Christlike love (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Relationship precedes mission: by lingering, Peter equips them to stand firm before he departs (<a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>). Such follow-up safeguards against error and strengthens their witness to the wider Gentile community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-48.htm">Acts 10:48</a> records two decisive responses to God&#8217;s work: Peter commands immediate, public baptism in Jesus&#8217; name, confirming that Gentile believers are fully accepted through faith alone; and the new converts seek further fellowship and instruction, illustrating the ongoing nurture essential to Christian growth. Together, these actions reveal that salvation unites diverse people in Christ, calls for obedient identification through baptism, and flourishes in shared life and teaching.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(48) <span class= "bld">And he commanded them . . .</span>--It would seem from this that St. Peter acted on the same general principle as St. Paul (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;">1Corinthians 1:14-17</a>), and left the actual administration of baptism to other hands than his own. Who administered it in this instance we are not told. Possibly there may have been an <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> already organised at Caesarea, as the result of Philip's work, and its elders or deacons, or Philip himself, may have acted under Peter's orders.

That visit to Caesarea, St. Luke dwells on as one of the great turning-points in the Apostle's life, attesting his essential agreement with St. Paul. We can well understand how he shrank from marring the effect of that attestation by recording the melancholy inconsistency of his subsequent conduct at Antioch (<a href="/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.
