Paul, under house arrest in Rome, was given some freedom to receive visitors. This reflects the Roman legal system's allowance for a degree of liberty for those awaiting trial. The setting of a specific day shows the interest and respect the Jewish leaders in Rome had for Paul, despite his imprisonment.<p><b>and many people came to the place he was staying</b><br>The gathering of many people highlights the significant interest in Paul's message. This was likely a diverse group, including Jews and possibly some Gentiles, reflecting the multicultural nature of Rome. The location, being Paul's rented house, suggests an informal yet earnest setting for teaching and discussion, reminiscent of early Christian house churches.<p><b>He expounded to them from morning to evening</b><br>Paul's dedication is evident in his willingness to teach all day. This mirrors the rabbinic tradition of thorough teaching and discussion. The phrase indicates a comprehensive and detailed explanation, showing Paul's deep knowledge of Scripture and his commitment to sharing the gospel.<p><b>testifying about the kingdom of God</b><br>The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings and the New Testament. Paul's testimony would have included the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the inauguration of God's kingdom through Jesus Christ. This concept would resonate with Jewish expectations of a messianic kingdom, though Paul redefines it in light of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.<p><b>and persuading them about Jesus</b><br>Paul's approach was both testimonial and persuasive, indicating a reasoned argument for Jesus as the Messiah. This reflects the early Christian emphasis on apologetics and evangelism. Paul's method aligns with his other writings, where he often reasons with his audience, using Scripture to demonstrate Jesus' messianic role.<p><b>from the Law of Moses and the Prophets</b><br>Paul's use of the Law and the Prophets underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. By referencing these texts, Paul connects Jesus to the Jewish tradition, showing that Jesus is the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies. This approach would be particularly compelling to a Jewish audience familiar with these scriptures, as it validates the Christian claim of Jesus as the promised Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is under house arrest in Rome, continuing his mission to preach the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where Paul is staying, a significant center of the ancient world and the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The group of people Paul is addressing, who are interested in hearing his message about Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_moses_and_the_prophets.htm">The Law of Moses and the Prophets</a></b><br>The Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) that Paul uses to explain and persuade about Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>A central theme of Paul's teaching, referring to God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture_in_evangelism.htm">The Importance of Scripture in Evangelism</a></b><br>Paul uses the Law of Moses and the Prophets to explain Jesus, highlighting the importance of knowing and using Scripture in sharing the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_ministry.htm">Perseverance in Ministry</a></b><br>Despite being under house arrest, Paul continues to preach from morning to evening, demonstrating dedication and perseverance in ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Centrality of the Kingdom of God</a></b><br>Paul's focus on the Kingdom of God reminds us of the overarching account of God's redemptive plan through Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/engaging_with_different_audiences.htm">Engaging with Different Audiences</a></b><br>Paul tailors his message to his Jewish audience by using familiar Scriptures, teaching us to consider our audience when sharing the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy_in_affirming_jesus_as_messiah.htm">The Role of Prophecy in Affirming Jesus as Messiah</a></b><br>By using the Prophets, Paul shows how prophecy confirms Jesus' identity, encouraging us to understand and share these connections.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_28_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 28:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_share_God_s_kingdom_today.htm">How can we effectively "testify about the kingdom of God" in our community today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_did_Paul_persuade_about_Jesus.htm">What methods did Paul use to "persuade them about Jesus" in Acts 28:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_28_23_Jesus_kingdom_teachings.htm">How does Acts 28:23 connect with Jesus' teachings on the kingdom of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Paul_s_gospel_zeal_to_our_lives.htm">How can we apply Paul's perseverance in sharing the gospel to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_s_role_in_grasping_Jesus.htm">What role does the Old Testament play in understanding Jesus, as seen in Acts 28:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_28_23_Paul_s_Gospel_dedication.htm">How does Acts 28:23 demonstrate Paul's commitment to spreading the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_28_23_Early_Christian_evangelism.htm">What does Acts 28:23 reveal about the early Christian approach to evangelism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_28_23_and_OT_prophecy_fulfillment.htm">How does Acts 28:23 reflect the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defined_early_christianity.htm">What characterized early Christianity in its initial stages?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_paul's_'imperial_guard'_claim_exaggerated.htm">Does Paul&#8217;s statement about the &#8220;whole imperial guard&#8221; (Philippians 1:13) knowing his message suggest a historical exaggeration rather than a literal event?
