Peter, an apostle, was speaking to a group of Gentiles, which was significant because Jews traditionally did not associate with Gentiles. This moment marks a pivotal shift in the early church's mission, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel. The act of speaking is central to the spread of the Gospel, as faith comes from hearing the message of Christ (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>the Holy Spirit fell upon them</b><br>The falling of the Holy Spirit signifies divine approval and empowerment. This mirrors the events of Pentecost in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. The Holy Spirit's presence confirms God's acceptance of the Gentiles, breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles. This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>just as He had fallen upon us</b><br>Peter draws a parallel between the Gentiles' experience and the apostles' experience at Pentecost. This comparison underscores the equality of all believers in receiving the Holy Spirit, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. It highlights the unity of the church and the universality of the Gospel message. The apostles' experience serves as a benchmark for authenticating the work of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>at the beginning</b><br>This phrase refers to the day of Pentecost, which is considered the "beginning" of the church's mission in the power of the Holy Spirit. Pentecost is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that the disciples would receive power when the Holy Spirit came upon them. It marks the start of the church's expansion from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
