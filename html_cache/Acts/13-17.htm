It reflects the monotheistic belief central to Jewish identity and underscores the continuity of God's promises from the patriarchs to the present. This is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation.<p><b>chose our fathers</b><br>The term "chose" indicates divine election, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. This choice began with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;whom God selected to establish His covenant people. This election is not based on merit but on God's sovereign will (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). It sets the stage for Israel's unique role in salvation history.<p><b>He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt</b><br>This refers to the period of Israelite growth in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>, where the Israelites multiplied greatly. Despite their eventual enslavement, God's promise to Abraham about his descendants becoming numerous (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>) was fulfilled. This growth in a foreign land underscores God's providence and faithfulness.<p><b>and with an uplifted arm</b><br>The "uplifted arm" symbolizes God's power and might in delivering Israel from bondage. It is a metaphor for divine intervention and strength, often used in the context of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This imagery conveys God's active role in history, demonstrating His ability to save and protect His people.<p><b>He led them out of that land</b><br>This phrase refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God liberated the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. It is a pivotal moment that defines Israel's identity as God's chosen people and is celebrated annually in the Passover.

Paul ties Israel&#8217;s story to the gospel, showing that the God who acted in Exodus now acts in Christ. The same uplifted arm that freed Israel still saves all who trust Him today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The God of this people of Israel.</span>--It will be observed that St. Paul, as far as the plan of his discourse is concerned, follows in the footsteps of St. Stephen, and begins by a recapitulation of the main facts of the history of Israel. It was a theme which Israelites were never tired of listening to. It showed that the Apostles recognised it as the history of God's chosen people.<p><span class= "bld">And exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in their sojourning in the land of Egypt.</span> The word for "exalt" is found in the Greek of <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>, where our version has, "I have nourished and <span class= "ital">brought up</span> children," and may fairly be considered as an echo from the lesson that had just been read. It may be noted that it was only in this sense, as increasing rapidly in population, that Israel could be spoken of as "exalted" in the house of bondage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Israel</span> for <span class="accented">of Israel</span>, A.V., <span class="accented">sojourned</span> for <span class="accented">dwelt as strangers</span>, A.V.; a for <span class="accented">an</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">led he them forth</span> for <span class="accented">brought he them out</span>, A.V. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, exalted, is thought by some to be borrowed from the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), I have brought up" (A.V.), but this is very doubtful, as <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is frequently used in the New Testament in the sense of exalting from a low to a high estate (see <a href="/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>; <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>; <a href="/luke/10-15.htm">Luke 10:15</a>; <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>; see too <a href="/genesis/41-52.htm">Genesis 41:52</a> (LXX., Cod. Vat.) and Gen 48:19). The resemblance of this exordium to that of Stephen's speech in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>. must strike every one. The natural conclusion is that that speech made a deep impression upon St. Paul when he heard it at Stephen's trial. The common purpose in the two speeches is to conciliate and gain the attention of the Jewish hearers by dwelling upon the great events of the history of their fathers, of which they were proud, and claiming for Christians an equal heritage in that history. The speeches diverge in that Stephen sought to show in that history instances of the same stubborn unbelief in their fathers which had led the children to crucify the Lord of glory; but St. Paul rather sought to show how the promises made to their fathers had their fulfillment in that Jesus whom he preached unto them, and how the crucifixion of Christ by the Jerusalem Jews was an exact fulfillment of the Law and the prophets which had just been read to them in the synagogue. In both speeches it is a great point to exhibit Christianity as the true development of Judaism (comp. <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> and throughout). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
