The context is the early church in Antioch, a significant center for early Christianity. Antioch was a major city in the Roman Empire, known for its diverse population and as a hub for missionary activity. The time spent there likely involved teaching, encouragement, and strengthening the believers, as was common in the early church (<a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27-28</a>).<p><b>they were sent off by the brothers in peace</b><br>The sending off "in peace" reflects the unity and harmony within the early church community. This peace is a hallmark of Christian fellowship, as seen in other New Testament writings (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). The "brothers" refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond among Christians. This act of sending off also shows the practice of the early church to support and commission missionaries, a pattern seen throughout Acts (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>).<p><b>to return to those who had sent them</b><br>This phrase highlights the accountability and connection between the missionaries and their sending church. The return to those who sent them underscores the importance of reporting back and maintaining relationships with the sending community. This practice is evident in Paul's missionary journeys, where he often returned to Antioch to report on his work (<a href="/acts/14-26.htm">Acts 14:26-27</a>). It reflects the early church's commitment to mission work and the mutual support between missionaries and their home churches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early church who were involved in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas.htm">Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas</a></b><br>Prophets and leaders in the early church who were sent with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch to deliver the council's decision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>A major center of early Christianity where the term "Christian" was first used.

Time was needed for the church to digest the good news that Gentiles were not bound by the Mosaic Law for salvation (<a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226;It also implies active ministry. Verse 32 states, &#8220;Both Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers&#8221;. Their time wasn&#8217;t idle; God used it to build up the congregation, just as Paul later spent &#8220;a year and six months&#8221; teaching in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226;The patient pace underscores the Spirit&#8217;s rhythm&#8212;ministry never has to rush when it rests in the Lord&#8217;s timing (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were sent off by the brothers in peace</b><p>The next clause reads, &#8220;they were sent off by the brothers in peace&#8230;.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8220;Sent off&#8221; echoes earlier missionary send-offs&#8212;Barnabas and Saul at Antioch (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>) and Paul and Silas leaving Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a>). Each time, believers commission and commend workers to God (cf. 3 <a href="/bsb/john/6.htm">John 6</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8220;By the brothers&#8221; highlights unity. Tension over circumcision had threatened to fracture the church, but now Antioch believers actively bless Jerusalem&#8217;s emissaries. Compare <a href="/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>: &#8220;it seemed good to us, having come to unanimous agreement&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226;&#8220;In peace&#8221; signals full reconciliation. No lingering suspicion, only the harmony Christ secured (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>). Peaceful farewells are a recurring mark of gospel partnership (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-11.htm">1 Corinthians 16:11</a>; <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226;The literal, historical note of peace assures us that doctrinal clarity produces relational peace when believers yield to Scripture&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to return to those who had sent them.</b><p>The verse ends, &#8220;&#8230;to return to those who had sent them.&#8221;<p>&#8226;They return to Jerusalem, completing the assignment given in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>. Accountability matters: missionary messengers report back, just as Paul and Barnabas did after their first journey (<a href="/acts/14-26.htm">Acts 14:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226;This circular pattern&#8212;sent, minister, report&#8212;keeps the whole church engaged in God&#8217;s mission (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>).<p>&#8226;It also confirms God&#8217;s faithfulness. The envoys came home &#8220;in peace,&#8221; demonstrating that the Lord who sends also safeguards (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>; <a href="/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226;The phrase reminds us to finish what we start. Their obedient return models the integrity Paul later required of Titus&#8217;s traveling companions (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-33.htm">Acts 15:33</a> records a simple goodbye that speaks volumes. After a fruitful season of strengthening the Antioch believers, Judas and Silas are peacefully commissioned to return to Jerusalem.
