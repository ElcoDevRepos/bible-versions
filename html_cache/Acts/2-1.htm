It commemorates the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, which is significant as it marks the birth of Israel as a covenant community. In the New Testament context, Pentecost becomes the day when the Holy Spirit is poured out on the disciples, marking the birth of the Church. This event fulfills Jesus' promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>) and aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a> about God pouring out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>they were all together in one place</b><br>The disciples, numbering about 120 (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>), were gathered in Jerusalem, likely in the upper room where they had been staying (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>). This unity and obedience to Jesus' command to wait in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>) demonstrate their faith and readiness to receive the Holy Spirit. The gathering in one place also signifies the importance of community and fellowship in the early Church, setting a precedent for collective worship and prayer. This unity is a reflection of the unity of the Trinity and is essential for the mission of the Church, as seen in Jesus' prayer for unity among His followers (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were gathered together.

That choice may have been determined, if one may so speak, either in view of the circumstances of the feast, or of its history and symbolic fitness.<p>(1) Of all the feasts of the Jewish year, it was that which attracted the largest number of pilgrims from distant lands. The dangers of travel by sea or land in the early spring or late autumn (comp. <a href="/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>) prevented their coming in any large numbers to the Passover or the Feast of Tabernacles. At no other feast would there have been representatives of so many nations. So, it may be noted, it was the Feast of Pentecost that St. Paul went up to keep once and again, during his mission-work in Greece and Asia. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.">Acts 18:21</a>; <a href="/acts/20-16.htm" title="For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hurried, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.">Acts 20:16</a>.)
