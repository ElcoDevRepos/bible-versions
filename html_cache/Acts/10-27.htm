Peter, a Jew, speaking with Cornelius, a Roman centurion, highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel message. This interaction fulfills Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." The act of talking signifies openness and willingness to engage with those outside the Jewish community, reflecting the transformative work of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>he went inside</b><br>Peter's decision to enter the home of a Gentile was a radical departure from Jewish customs, which typically avoided such interactions to maintain ritual purity. This action demonstrates Peter's obedience to the vision he received earlier in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where God showed him that what He has made clean should not be called impure. This moment signifies the breaking of traditional barriers and the expansion of the Church's mission.<p><b>and found many people gathered together</b><br>The gathering of many people in Cornelius's house indicates the widespread interest in the message of Jesus Christ beyond the Jewish community. It reflects the hunger for spiritual truth among the Gentiles and the readiness of the harvest, as Jesus mentioned in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37</a>. This assembly also prefigures the future gatherings of diverse believers in the Church, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his role in spreading the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion who is described earlier in <a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> as a devout man who feared God, gave alms generously, and prayed continually to God.

He listens first, modeling the gentle engagement urged later in <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>.<p>&#8226; The Spirit often works through ordinary dialogue (<a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a>; <a href="/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>). God&#8217;s truth travels on the rails of respectful conversation.<p>&#8226; Talking with a Gentile was no small step for a Jewish believer, but Peter embraces it because the Lord has said, &#8220;Do not call anything impure that God has made clean&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he went inside</b><p>&#8220;He went in and found&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-27.htm">Acts 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Crossing Cornelius&#8217;s threshold breaks long-standing social and ceremonial boundaries (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>; 11:3).<p>&#8226; The action echoes Jesus entering the Samaritan woman&#8217;s world at Jacob&#8217;s well (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9&#8211;10</a>) and foreshadows Paul&#8217;s resolve to eat with believers of every background (<a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; By physically stepping in, Peter lives out the truth that &#8220;He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience often demands movement: Noah builds, Abraham journeys, Peter walks through a Gentile door.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>found many people gathered together</b><p>&#8220;He went in and found many people gathered together&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-27.htm">Acts 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Cornelius has not kept the angel&#8217;s message to himself; he has filled the house (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24, 33</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene recalls crowds pressing to hear Jesus by the lake (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>) and the Upper Room packed on Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Readiness meets revelation: &#8220;The harvest is plentiful&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37</a>).
