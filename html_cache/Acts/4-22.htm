The miracle was performed by Peter and John, emphasizing the power of Jesus' name and the apostles' authority. Miraculous healings in the New Testament often served as signs to authenticate the message of the Gospel and the authority of the apostles. This healing also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, which speaks of the lame leaping like a deer, pointing to the messianic age inaugurated by Jesus.<p><b>was over forty years old</b><br>The mention of the man's age highlights the chronic nature of his condition, underscoring the miraculous nature of his healing. In biblical times, reaching the age of forty was significant, often symbolizing a generation or a period of testing and trial, as seen in the Israelites' forty years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The fact that the man was over forty emphasizes the long duration of his suffering and the undeniable power of the miracle, as he had been known to the community for many years as a beggar at the temple gate.

ties the undeniable facts of the healed man to the apostles&#8217; bold proclamation of Jesus&#8217; resurrection (<a href="/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>).<p>- As in <a href="/john/9-30.htm">John 9:30&#8211;33</a>, the word underscores that logical evidence backs the gospel message; truth is not based on wishful thinking but on verifiable acts of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the man</b><p>- Luke draws attention to a specific individual&#8212;no anonymous story but a recognizable person who had sat &#8220;at the temple gate called Beautiful&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>).<p>- His presence in Jerusalem&#8217;s public life made his transformation common knowledge (<a href="/acts/4-14.htm">Acts 4:14</a>).<p>- Personal testimony remains powerful (<a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>);
