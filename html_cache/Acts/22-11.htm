The "brilliance of the light" signifies the divine glory and presence of Jesus, often associated with God's revelation (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>, <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). This light was so intense that it physically blinded Paul, symbolizing his spiritual blindness and need for transformation. The blinding light is reminiscent of Old Testament theophanies where God's presence is revealed through light (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>).<p><b>my companions led me by the hand</b><br>Paul's companions, who were likely fellow travelers or guards, had to guide him due to his blindness. This act of being led by the hand underscores Paul's helplessness and dependence, a stark contrast to his previous self-reliance and authority as a Pharisee. It illustrates the humbling process God often uses to prepare individuals for His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>into Damascus</b><br>Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, located in modern-day Syria. At the time of Paul's journey, it was a significant cultural and commercial center. Historically, Damascus was a place of refuge and transformation for Paul, where he would begin his new mission as an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). The city's mention connects to the broader narrative of the early church's expansion beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling Jesus' command to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Paul recounts his conversion experience on the road to Damascus.
