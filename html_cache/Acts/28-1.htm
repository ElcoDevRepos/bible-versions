The context is the aftermath of a shipwreck described in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, where Paul, along with other passengers, survived a violent storm. This survival fulfills God's promise to Paul that he would stand trial before Caesar (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of divine deliverance and the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises.<p><b>we learned that the island was called Malta</b><br>Malta, known in ancient times as Melita, is a small island in the Mediterranean Sea. Its strategic location made it a significant stop for ancient maritime travel. Archaeological evidence supports the presence of Roman influence on the island during this period. Historically, Malta was known for its hospitable inhabitants, which aligns with the narrative in <a href="/acts/28-2.htm">Acts 28:2</a>, where the islanders show kindness to Paul and his companions. The mention of Malta connects to the broader narrative of the spread of the Gospel, as Paul's journey to Rome is part of God's plan to take the message of Christ to the heart of the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who was shipwrecked on the island of Malta while being transported as a prisoner to Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/malta.htm">Malta</a></b><br>- An island in the Mediterranean Sea where Paul and his companions were shipwrecked.

God&#8217;s physical deliverance mirrors the greater rescue He grants in Christ (<a href="/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16-19</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the order: God saves first, then reveals the next assignment. His protection always precedes His fresh directions (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-15</a>:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We learned</b><p>After the pounding surf, there is quiet curiosity.<p>&#8226; Learning requires humility&#8212;Paul and his companions listen to local voices, a practical step we often overlook (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God does not despise ordinary information. Just as He used a centurion to warn Paul earlier (<a href="/acts/27-43.htm">Acts 27:43</a>), He now uses islanders to supply critical details for the journey ahead.<p>&#8226; This line also shows Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability.

The gale, which had been blowing for fourteen days since the ship left Crete, would drive her in that direction. The local features of St. Paul's Bay agree closely, as has been seen, with the narrative in the Acts. There has from a very early date been a local tradition in favour of the belief. The Bay bears St. Paul's name. A cave is pointed out as having given him shelter. There has, however, been a rival claimant. In the Gulf of Venice, off the coast of Illyria, there is a small "island, Meleta (now <span class= "ital">Meleda</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which has been identified by some writers with the scene of St. Paul's shipwreck. The view is first mentioned by Constantino Porphyrogenitus, a Greek writer of the tenth century, and was revived in the last century by Padre Georgi, an ecclesiastic of the island. There is, however, not a shadow of evidence in its favour, beyond the similarity (riot identity) of name, and the mention of Adria in <a href="/acts/27-27.htm" title="But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;">Acts 27:27</a>. It has been shown, however, that that term was used with far too wide a range to be decisive on such a question; and against the view there are the facts (1) that it would almost have required a miracle to get the ship, with a north-east gale blowing strongly, up to the Illyrian coast of the Gulf of Venice; (2) that a ship would not naturally have wintered on that coast on its way from Alexandria to Puteoli (<a href="/acts/28-11.htm" title="And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.">Acts 28:11</a>); (3) that there has been no local tradition in its favour, as at Malta. The island of Malta was originally a Phoenician colony. It came under the power of Carthage in B.C. 402, and was ceded to Rome in B.C. 242. Its temple, dedicated to Juno, was rich enough to be an object of plunder to Verres, the Praetor of Sicily (Cic. <span class= "ital">In Verr.</span> vv. 46).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - We for <span class="accented">they</span>, A.V. and T.R. (twice). <span class="cmt_word">Was called</span>. It reads as if it was the answer to their question to the natives, "What is this island called?" <span class="cmt_word">Melita</span>. That Melita is the island of <span class="accented">Malta</span>, and not <span class="accented">Meleda</span> off the coast of Dalmatia, is demonstrated in Smith's ' Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul,' and it is not worth while here to consider the arguments in favor of Meleda. <span class="accented">Melita</span> appears to be a Phoenician name, from the root in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, to escape (Bochart, 'Canaan,' 1:26), meaning, therefore, a "refuge," a harbor of refuge so called from sailors often running into Valetta during a gale; or possibly from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;</span>, clay, in Italian <span class="accented">malta</span>, from the clay which forms the bottom of the sea as you approach Malta, and which makes the anchorage so safe. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians, whether from Tyre or Carthage cannot be pronounced with certainty, though we know it was a Carthaginian possession at the time of the first Punic War. It fell into the hands of the Romans <span class="date">B.C. 218</span>, and at the time of St. Paul's shipwreck was annexed to the province of Sicily. The population, however, was Phoenician or Punic, and probably knew little Greek or Latin. The name of a fountain in St. Paul's Bay, <span class="accented">Ayn tal Razzul</span>, "The Apostle's Fountain," is said (Smith, p. 24) to be Phoenician. But this is extremely doubtful. It is far more probably, not to say certainly, the corrupt Africano-Arabic dialect of the island, as I venture to affirm on the high authority of Professor Wright. Gesenius is also distinctly of opinion that there are no remains of Phoenician in the Maltese, and that all the words in the Maltese language which have been thought to be Phoenician are really Arabic. Four genuine Phoenician inscriptions have, however, been found in the island ('Monument. Phoenic,' pars prima, pp. 90-111,252, and 341). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Once]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">we were safely ashore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#969;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(dias&#333;thentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1295.htm">Strong's 1295: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dia and sozo; to save thoroughly, i.e. to cure, preserve, rescue, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we learned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#941;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epegn&#333;men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1921.htm">Strong's 1921: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and ginosko; to know upon some mark, i.e. Recognize; by implication, to become fully acquainted with, to acknowledge.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
