Peter, a leading apostle, is speaking with authority and revelation, setting the stage for a significant theological shift.<p><b>&#8220;You know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or visit him.</b><br>Jewish law, based on interpretations of the Torah, emphasized separation from Gentiles to maintain ritual purity. This separation was cultural and religious, rooted in passages like <a href="/leviticus/20-24.htm">Leviticus 20:24-26</a>, which called for Israel to be distinct. The term "unlawful" reflects the strong social and religious boundaries of the time, though not explicitly stated in the Mosaic Law, it was a traditional interpretation. This separation was also a means to avoid idolatry and maintain covenantal identity.<p><b>But God has shown me</b><br>This revelation came through Peter's vision in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, where a sheet with unclean animals was lowered from heaven, and God instructed Peter to eat. This vision was a divine intervention, challenging Peter's understanding of purity laws and preparing him for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community. It signifies a direct communication from God, emphasizing the authority and divine origin of the message.<p><b>that I should not call any man impure or unclean.</b><br>This statement marks a pivotal moment in the early church, where the distinction between Jew and Gentile is abolished in Christ. It echoes the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized inner purity over ritual cleanliness (<a href="/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>). This revelation aligns with the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where salvation is extended to the ends of the earth. It foreshadows the inclusion of all nations in the promise of the Gospel, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).

Though the written Law never strictly forbade entering a Gentile home, rabbinic tradition made such contact socially unthinkable (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This separation underscored God&#8217;s holiness and Israel&#8217;s call to be &#8220;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet it could foster pride and prejudice, as later seen when Peter himself drew back from Gentiles &#8220;fearing the party of the circumcision&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment highlights how human custom can harden beyond the intent of God&#8217;s Law, a pattern Jesus confronted in <a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8&#8211;13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But God has shown me</b><p>Everything pivots on divine revelation, not human reasoning.<p>&#8226; The rooftop vision of the sheet (<a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11&#8211;16</a>) dismantled long-standing categories: &#8220;What God has made clean, you must not call impure&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s initiative echoes how He led Philip to the Ethiopian (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-29</a>) and later Paul to Macedonia (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>), reinforcing that mission flows from heaven&#8217;s command.<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses personal transformation: Peter moves from hesitation to conviction, mirroring the gospel&#8217;s power to renew minds (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I should not call any man impure or unclean</b><p>Peter interprets the vision correctly: its ultimate target is people, not food.<p>&#8226; In Christ, the dividing wall of hostility is broken (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; God &#8220;made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel&#8217;s reach fulfills promises that &#8220;all the families of the earth&#8221; will be blessed through Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; While dietary symbols of purity are fulfilled (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>; <a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>), the call to moral holiness remains (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates the heavenly chorus singing, &#8220;You purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a> captures the moment God dismantles cultural and ceremonial barriers, opening the door of salvation to Gentiles without requiring them to become Jews first.

The very dust of a heathen city was defiling. The Hindoo feeling of caste, shrinking from contact with those of a lower grade, driven to madness and mutiny by "greased cartridges," presents the nearest modern analogue.<p><span class= "bld">God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span>--The Apostle had, we find, at last learnt the lesson which the vision had taught him, in all the fulness of its meaning. Humanity as such had been redeemed by the Incarnation and Ascension, and was no longer common or unclean, even in the most outcast heathen. God was willing to receive all men. Sin alone was that which separated men from Him. Impurity was thought of as a moral, not a physical taint, and men were taught to see even in the sinner the potentialities of a higher life. He, too, had been redeemed, and might be justified and sanctified, and to him therefore honour and reverence were due as to one in whom the image of God was not utterly effaced, and might be restored to brightness. It is interesting, in this connection, to note the "Honour all men" of <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. It is obvious that the pride of class, resting on mere differences of culture, and showing itself in acts and words of contempt, is, from one point of view, even less excusable than that which at least imagined that it rested on a religious basis, while from another, it is less inveterate, and therefore more easily curable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Ye <span class="accented">yourselves</span> for <span class="accented">ye</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to join himself</span> for <span class="accented">to keep company</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and yet unto me hath God showed</span> for <span class="accented">but God hath showed me</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye yourselves know</span>. It was notorious among the Romans that the Jews kept themselves aloof from other people. Hence the accusation against them, in common with Christians, of being haters of the human race. Tacitus says of them that they hated all people, except their own countrymen, as their enemies, and refused to eat or intermarry with them ("Separati epulis discreti cubilibus;" 'Hist.,' 5:5). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">one of another nation</span>, occurs only here in the New Testament, but is common in the LXX. often as a synonym for "Philistines" (see <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>, etc.).
