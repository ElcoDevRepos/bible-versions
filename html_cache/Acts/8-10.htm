The mention of "from the least to the greatest" suggests a societal cross-section, indicating that people of all social standings were captivated by Simon's acts. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where miraculous signs and wonders were often seen as evidence of divine favor or power. The phrase also echoes other biblical instances where entire communities are influenced by a single figure, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>, where the people of Nineveh, from the greatest to the least, believed God and repented.<p><b>heeded his words and said,</b><br>The people not only observed Simon's actions but also listened to and accepted his claims. This highlights the power of persuasion and the human tendency to follow charismatic leaders, especially those who appear to wield supernatural power. The act of heeding words is significant in biblical narratives, as it often leads to either blessing or judgment, depending on the source of the message. In this case, the people's acceptance of Simon's words sets the stage for the contrast with the true power of the Gospel that Philip would later preach.<p><b>&#8220;This man is the divine power</b><br>The attribution of divine power to Simon reflects the syncretistic religious environment of Samaria, where elements of Jewish belief, pagan practices, and local traditions intermingled. The Samaritans' declaration suggests a misunderstanding or misapplication of divine attributes, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. This phrase can be contrasted with the true divine power demonstrated by Jesus Christ and His apostles, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the Holy Spirit empowers the disciples to be witnesses.<p><b>called the Great Power.&#8221;</b><br>The title "the Great Power" implies a significant level of reverence and possibly fear. It suggests that Simon was seen as more than just a magician; he was considered a manifestation of divine authority. This reflects the human tendency to deify individuals who exhibit extraordinary abilities, a theme seen throughout history and scripture. The title also sets up a stark contrast with the true "Great Power" of God, as demonstrated through the miracles and teachings of Jesus and His apostles. This prepares the reader for the subsequent revelation of the true power of the Holy Spirit through Philip's ministry in Samaria.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_sorcerer.htm">Simon the Sorcerer</a></b><br>A man in Samaria who practiced sorcery and amazed the people, claiming to be someone great.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_samaria.htm">The People of Samaria</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Samaria who were captivated by Simon's sorcery and regarded him as having divine power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip_the_evangelist.htm">Philip the Evangelist</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Philip's presence in Samaria is crucial as he later preaches the gospel, leading to the conversion of many, including Simon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region in the ancient Near East, significant for its mixed population and historical tensions with the Jews.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_power.htm">The Great Power</a></b><br>A title attributed to Simon by the people, indicating their belief in his supernatural abilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_true_power.htm">Discernment of True Power</a></b><br>Believers must discern between true divine power and deceptive practices.

Luke is stressing the sweeping influence Simon the sorcerer had over Samaria.<p>&#8226; The description mirrors earlier moments when entire crowds gathered&#8212;for example, at Pentecost when &#8220;the crowd came together&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a>), and later when almost &#8220;the whole city&#8221; assembled to hear Paul (<a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that public opinion, when detached from truth, can be swayed en masse (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene warns that large numbers do not guarantee spiritual authenticity&#8212;something Jesus foresaw in <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13&#8211;14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the least to the greatest</b><p>Luke adds, &#8220;from the least to the greatest,&#8221; underscoring that every social layer&#8212;poor to prominent&#8212;fell under Simon&#8217;s spell.<p>&#8226; Similar language appears in <a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a> to stress total community participation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word treats all people equally in accountability and in grace (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>). Yet here, equality appears in collective deception, reminding us how easily status can be forgotten when the spectacular dazzles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heeded his words</b><p>The people &#8220;heeded his words,&#8221; giving Simon their full attention.<p>&#8226; Just four verses earlier, the Samaritans &#8220;gave heed&#8221; to Philip because they witnessed genuine miracles and heard Christ preached (<a href="/acts/8-6.htm">Acts 8:6</a>).

Peter adds that many will &#8220;follow their depraved conduct&#8221; of false teachers (<a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights the necessity of testing every message (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>) and weighing it against the whole counsel of Scripture (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>Their response moved from listening to declaring.

Their collective, vocal confession that Simon embodied &#8220;the divine power&#8221; reveals humanity&#8217;s readiness to deify the spectacular.

If One had come among them in whom they felt that there was a more than human greatness, why might there not be another manifestation of a like nature? The sorcerer appears as the earliest type of those who were to come with lying signs and wonders so as to deceive, if it were possible, even the elect (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">This man is the great power of God.</span>--The better MSS. give, "This is the Power of God that is called great."
