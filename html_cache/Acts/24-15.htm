It underscores the continuity of Paul's faith with the Jewish tradition, emphasizing that Christianity is not a departure from Judaism but a fulfillment of its promises. This hope is rooted in the Old Testament, where figures like Job (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>) express belief in life after death.<p><b>that they themselves cherish</b><br>Here, "they" refers to the Jewish leaders, particularly the Pharisees, who also believed in the resurrection. This shared belief highlights a common theological ground between Paul and his accusers, despite their opposition to him. It also serves to show that the Christian message is not entirely foreign to Jewish thought. The Pharisees' belief in the resurrection is documented in historical texts like the writings of Josephus.<p><b>that there will be a resurrection</b><br>The concept of resurrection is central to Christian doctrine, affirming life after death and the eventual restoration of all things. This belief is not only a New Testament revelation but is also found in the Hebrew Scriptures, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian hope, as it promises eternal life through Jesus Christ, who is the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><b>of both the righteous and the wicked</b><br>This phrase indicates a universal resurrection, where all people, regardless of their moral standing, will be raised. This is consistent with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>, where He speaks of a resurrection to life and a resurrection to judgment. It underscores the biblical theme of divine justice and accountability, where every individual will face judgment based on their deeds (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>).

(<a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus tied hope directly to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness: &#8220;God is not the God of the dead, but of the living&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>).<p>Because God has proven Himself faithful&#8212;above all in raising Jesus (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>)&#8212;Paul&#8217;s confidence is rock solid.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That they themselves cherish</b><p>Paul appeals to common ground with his Jewish accusers, many of whom were Pharisees.<p>&#8226;
