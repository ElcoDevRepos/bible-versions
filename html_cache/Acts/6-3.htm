This reflects the Jewish custom of addressing fellow believers as "brothers," highlighting unity and mutual responsibility. The use of "therefore" connects this instruction to the preceding issue of neglect in the daily distribution to widows, showing a direct response to a practical need within the community.<p><b>select from among you</b><br>The instruction to "select from among you" underscores the importance of community involvement in decision-making. It reflects the democratic process within the early church, where the congregation had a role in choosing leaders. This method ensured that those chosen were well-known and respected by the community, fostering trust and accountability.<p><b>seven men</b><br>The choice of "seven men" may have cultural and practical significance. In Jewish tradition, the number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection. Additionally, seven was a common number for councils or committees in Jewish and Greco-Roman societies, suggesting a structured and organized approach to leadership. This selection was likely influenced by the need for a manageable group to oversee the specific task of fair distribution.<p><b>confirmed to be full of the Spirit and wisdom.</b><br>The requirement for the men to be "full of the Spirit and wisdom" highlights the spiritual and practical qualifications necessary for leadership. Being "full of the Spirit" indicates a life led by the Holy Spirit, marked by spiritual maturity and integrity. "Wisdom" refers to practical insight and the ability to make sound decisions, essential for managing the church's resources and addressing the needs of the community. This mirrors the qualities seen in leaders throughout Scripture, such as Joseph and Daniel, who were known for their wisdom and divine guidance.<p><b>We will assign this responsibility to them</b><br>The apostles' decision to "assign this responsibility to them" demonstrates the delegation of duties within the church, allowing the apostles to focus on prayer and the ministry of the word. This division of labor reflects the body of Christ's diverse gifts and roles, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.

By grounding their directive in fellowship rather than hierarchy, they echo Jesus&#8217; teaching that leaders are servants among siblings (<a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8&#8211;11</a>). <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a> shows these same &#8220;brothers&#8221; already sharing doctrine, meals, and prayers together, so the appeal comes naturally from within that shared life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>select from among you</b><p>The congregation, not an outside body, is to identify the candidates.

This mirrors Moses hearing Jethro&#8217;s counsel to share the load (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-23</a>) and aligns with Paul&#8217;s later teaching that leaders equip others for works of service (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>).

Possibly, however, the suggestion may have come from the <span class= "ital">Libertini</span>, or Hellenistae of Rome<span class= "ital">, </span>where there was a distinct guild, or <span class= "ital">Collegium, </span>known as the <span class= "ital">Septemviri Epulones, </span>or Seven Stewards (Lucan. i. 602), whose business it was to arrange for the banquets held in honour of the gods, which were more or less analogous to the Christian <span class= "ital">agap?, </span>on certain set days. (See Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities, </span>Art. "Epulones." It is an interesting coincidence that they, too, had been appointed to relieve the Pontifices from a duty which they found too heavy. This view falls in with the inference as to the Roman origin of Stephen which will be found in the Notes on <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.</span>--The Apostles, it is clear, did not limit their thoughts of the Spirit's working to prophecy and the gift of tongues. Wherever wisdom, and charity, and kindness were requisite, there was need of a supernatural grace, raising men above prejudice and passion. Of these qualities, no less than of the good report, the whole body of believers were to be, in the first instance, the judges, the Apostles reserving to themselves the right of final appointment, and therefore, if necessary, of a veto. It is significant that the word "wisdom" only appears in the Acts in connection with Stephen (here and in <a href="/acts/6-10.htm" title="And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.">Acts 6:10</a>, and in the report of his speech <a href="/acts/7-10.htm" title="And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.">Acts 7:10</a>; <a href="/acts/7-22.htm" title="And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.">Acts 7:22</a>). We may, perhaps, think of James, the brother of the Lord, as led by what he now saw and heard to that prayerful seeking after wisdom which is so prominent in his Epistle (<a href="/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">James 1:5</a>; <a href="/context/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">James 3:13-17</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Look ye out therefore, brethren, from</span> for <span class="accented">wherefore, brethren, look ye out</span>, A.V.; good for <span class="accented">honest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Spirit</span> for <span class="accented">Holy Ghost</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">of wisdom</span> for <span class="accented">wisdom</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Good report</span>; literally, <span class="accented">borne witness to</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> well spoken cf.

The number seven was, perhaps, fixed upon with reference to the exigencies of the service, some think because there were seven tables to be supplied; and partly perhaps from <span class="accented">seven</span> being the sacred number, the number of completeness - seven Churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven children (<a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>), seven times (<a href="/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>). From seven having been the number of the first deacons arose the custom in some Churches of always having seven deacons, which continued some centuries in the Church of Rome. One of the Canons of the Council of Neo-caesarea (An). 314) enacted that "there ought to be but seven deacons in any city," and St. Mark is said to have ordained seven deacons at Alexandria (see Bingham, 'Christ. Antia' vol. 1. p. 232). But the needs of the Churches gradually superseded all such restrictions. <span class="cmt_word">Whom we may appoint</span>. The multitude elect, the apostles appoint. The apostolate appears as <span class="accented">the sole</span> ministry of the Church at first. From the apostolate is evolved first the diaconate, afterwards the presbyterate, as the need for each arose (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brothers,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
