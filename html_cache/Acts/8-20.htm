His response here is direct and authoritative, reflecting his leadership and the seriousness of the situation. This moment is reminiscent of Peter's boldness in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost, where he also addressed misunderstandings about the Holy Spirit.<p><b>May your silver perish with you</b><br>This phrase indicates a strong rebuke. The use of "silver" highlights the materialistic mindset of Simon the Sorcerer, who attempted to purchase spiritual power. The language echoes the Old Testament prophets who condemned idolatry and greed (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). It underscores the incompatibility of worldly wealth with spiritual gifts, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> about serving God versus money.<p><b>because you thought</b><br>This phrase points to the error in Simon's thinking, emphasizing the importance of a correct understanding of spiritual matters. It reflects the biblical theme that thoughts and intentions of the heart are crucial, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, which speaks of the Word of God discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<p><b>you could buy</b><br>The concept of buying spiritual gifts is antithetical to the gospel message. This reflects a misunderstanding of grace, which is freely given and cannot be purchased or earned. It contrasts with the story of Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>, where deceit regarding money also led to severe consequences.<p><b>the gift of God</b><br>The "gift of God" refers to the Holy Spirit, which is given freely to believers. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which speaks of salvation as a gift from God, not a result of works. The Holy Spirit's role as a gift is central to the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, where Jesus promises the Spirit to His followers.<p><b>with money!</b><br>The exclamation marks the absurdity and seriousness of Simon's proposition. It serves as a warning against the commodification of spiritual matters. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God's kingdom operates on principles vastly different from worldly systems, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which warns against the love of money.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his boldness in preaching the gospel.
