The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, enduring harsh treatment under Pharaoh's rule (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>). This mistreatment fulfills God's prophecy to Abraham that his descendants would be oppressed in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). Moses' awareness of the injustice reflects his growing identification with his people, despite being raised in Pharaoh's household (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>).<p><b>Moses went to his defense</b><br>Moses' action demonstrates his sense of justice and leadership, foreshadowing his future role as the deliverer of Israel. His intervention is an early indication of his calling, though it is not yet divinely sanctioned. This act of defense aligns with the biblical principle of standing up for the oppressed (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>).<p><b>and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian</b><br>Moses' response is both protective and retaliatory, highlighting the tension between human justice and divine timing. The act of striking down the Egyptian is significant, as it marks Moses' first recorded act of defiance against Egyptian authority. This event parallels the later plagues and judgments God would bring upon Egypt (Exodus 7-12). It also prefigures Christ's role as the ultimate avenger of injustice (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><b>who was oppressing him</b><br>The oppression of the Hebrew by the Egyptian is emblematic of the broader systemic injustice faced by the Israelites. This oppression is a catalyst for God's deliverance plan, as He hears the cries of His people (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-10</a>). The Egyptian's role as an oppressor underscores the theme of liberation that runs throughout the Exodus narrative, pointing to the spiritual liberation found in Christ (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who later becomes the leader of the Israelites.
