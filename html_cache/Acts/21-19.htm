This moment reflects the unity and fellowship among early Christians, despite cultural and geographical differences. The act of greeting is a common biblical practice, emphasizing community and brotherhood, as seen in <a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>.<p><b>and recounted one by one</b><br>Paul's detailed recounting indicates the importance of testimony in the early church.

This acknowledgment of divine intervention is crucial in understanding the nature of Christian ministry.<p><b>among the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan was a revolutionary concept in the early church, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.

His work is characterized by church planting, teaching, and performing miracles, all of which serve to authenticate his apostolic authority and the truth of the Gospel.
