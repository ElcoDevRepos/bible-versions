This term "God-fearing" was often used for Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel but had not fully converted to Judaism. His entire household shared in this devotion, suggesting his influence and leadership in spiritual matters. This reflects the biblical principle of household faith seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where Joshua declares, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." Cornelius's faith prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the early Christian church, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<p><b>He gave generously to the people</b><br>Cornelius's generosity is highlighted, showing his compassion and commitment to social justice, a value deeply rooted in Jewish law and echoed in Christian teaching. His giving to "the people" likely refers to the Jewish community, indicating his respect and support for them. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, "Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord," and foreshadows the Christian teaching of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>). His actions demonstrate a living faith, as emphasized in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, "Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."<p><b>and prayed to God regularly.</b><br>Cornelius's regular prayer life signifies his sincere devotion and desire for a relationship with God. This practice of prayer aligns with Jewish customs of set prayer times, such as those observed by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>). His commitment to prayer reflects the biblical call to "pray without ceasing" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>) and prepares the way for his divine encounter with an angel, leading to Peter's vision and the subsequent opening of the church to Gentiles. Cornelius's prayer life exemplifies the importance of consistent communication with God, a foundational aspect of Christian discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army stationed in Caesarea.

The phrase "those that feared God" is employed distinctly for this class in <a href="/acts/10-22.htm" title="And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you.">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="/acts/10-35.htm" title="But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.">Acts 10:35</a>, and again in <a href="/acts/13-16.htm" title="Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience.">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a>. There is a special significance in the addition "with all his house." The centurion was not satisfied with having found a higher truth for himself, but sought to impart it to the soldiers and slaves, possibly to those nearer and dearer to him, who came under his influence (Comp. <a href="/acts/10-7.htm" title="And when the angel which spoke to Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;">Acts 10:7</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Who</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A devout man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); and in ver. 7. It is an interesting question as to what was the precise religions status of Cornelius, whether he was a proselyte in any technical sense. But the whole narrative, in which he is spoken of simply as a Gentile and uncircumcised, seems to indicate that, though he had learnt from the Jews to worship the true God, and from the Jewish Scriptures read or heard in the synagogue to practice those virtues which went up for a memorial before God, yet he was in no sense a proselyte. It is pleasant to think that there may have been many such in the different countries where the Jews were dispersed (comp. <a href="/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>, and probably <a href="/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He and]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8058;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(syn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4862.htm">Strong's 4862: </a> </span><span class="str2">With.
