The term "disciples" indicates learners or students, emphasizing their role in spreading the teachings of Jesus. Historically, the early church faced persecution, yet they remained steadfast in their mission.<p><b>were filled with joy</b><br>Despite facing opposition and persecution, the disciples experienced profound joy. This joy is not merely an emotional response but a deep-seated sense of fulfillment and purpose derived from their faith and the presence of God in their lives. This joy is often seen as a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers find joy in trials (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-3</a>) and in the hope of salvation (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>).<p><b>and with the Holy Spirit</b><br>The filling of the Holy Spirit signifies empowerment and guidance for the disciples. In the book of Acts, the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the expansion of the early church, providing boldness, wisdom, and miraculous signs. This phrase connects to the promise of Jesus in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He assures His followers that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, and is essential for the life and mission of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus Christ who were spreading the Gospel message.

Paul and Barnabas have shaken the dust off their feet and moved on (<a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a>), yet &#8220;the word of the Lord spread through the whole region&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-49.htm">Acts 13:49</a>). Opposition, expulsion, and loss did not stop the gospel; the story keeps moving. In the same way, Jesus had warned that tribulation would come, but &#8220;take heart; I have overcome the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). The &#8220;And&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s work rolls forward in spite of setbacks, turning apparent defeat into advance (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The disciples</b><p>These are not just the Twelve. The term covers the new believers in Pisidian Antioch&#8212;men and women, Jews and Gentiles&#8212;who have received Christ (<a href="/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a>). Scripture consistently calls every follower a &#8220;disciple,&#8221; a learner who imitates Jesus (<a href="/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>).<p>&#8226; They have turned from dead religion to the living Savior (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; They now share the same identity as those who walked with Christ in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>Persecution did not thin their ranks; it clarified their allegiance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were filled</b><p>To be &#8220;filled&#8221; means to be under the full influence of something. Luke uses the phrase often: filled with fear (<a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>), with rage (<a href="/luke/6-11.htm">Luke 6:11</a>), or with the Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). Here it describes an ongoing, overflowing state, not a passing feeling. Compare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;Be filled with the Spirit,&#8221; an imperative for continual surrender.<p>God does not ration His presence; He pours it out until hearts overflow (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With joy</b><p>Joy is the first visible evidence of that filling. It is a deep-seated gladness that persists when circumstances turn sour.<p>&#8226; Jesus promised, &#8220;No one will take your joy from you&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul would later tell these same believers, &#8220;The kingdom of God is&#8230;righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy is fruit produced by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>), not manufactured by human optimism.<p>Even in affliction they &#8220;rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer shame for the Name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And</b><p>This second &#8220;and&#8221; links joy inseparably to the Spirit.

The new disciples, driven out of their synagogue and shunned by their city&#8217;s leaders, overflowed with supernatural joy because the Holy Spirit filled them. Their experience proves that, when God occupies the heart, gladness and power replace fear and defeat, and the gospel keeps moving forward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.</span>--The tense is again that which expresses the continuance of the state. The "joy" expresses what is almost the normal sequence of conversion in the history of the Acts. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/8-8.htm" title="And there was great joy in that city.">Acts 8:8</a>; <a href="/acts/8-39.htm" title="And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.">Acts 8:39</a>.) The addition of "the Holy Ghost" may imply special gifts like those of tongues and prophecy, but certainly involves a new intensity of spiritual life, of which joy was the natural outcome. As being conspicuous among the Gentile converts, we trace the impression which it then made, in words which St. Paul wrote long years afterwards, "The kingdom <span class= "ital">of</span> God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace, and <span class= "ital">joy in the Holy Ghost"</span> (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the disciples</span>, etc. Nothing can be more beautiful than this description. In spite of the persecution, in spite of the danger, in spite of the banishment of their teachers, the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-34.htm">Hebrews 10:34</a>). With regard to this important incident at Antioch, Renan observes on its powerful influence in turning St. Paul's mind more decisively to the conversion of the Gentiles as the great object of his apostleship. He adds, "The character of that great soul was to have a boundless power of expansion. I know none to be compared with it in respect of its inexhaustible freshness, its unlimited resources of will, and readiness to make the most of every opportunity, except that of Alexander the Great? <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5037.htm">Strong's 5037: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, both.
