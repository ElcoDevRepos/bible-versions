Cyprus is significant in early Christian history; it was the home of Barnabas and an early center of Christian activity. The island's mention here highlights the strategic navigation choices made due to weather conditions, which were common in ancient maritime travel.<p><b>because the winds were against us</b><br>The adverse winds suggest the challenges faced during the journey. In the Mediterranean, the Etesian winds blow from the northwest during the summer, which would have made sailing westward difficult. This detail underscores the hardships Paul and his companions endured, reflecting the broader theme of perseverance in the face of adversity. It also echoes other biblical narratives where natural elements play a role in God's providential plans, such as Jonah's story or Jesus calming the storm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

De Page, a French navigator, as saying, "The winds from the west which prevail in these places (Cyprus) forced us to run to the north." This is exactly what the ship in which Paul sailed did. Instead of going in a westerly direction, and leaving Cyprus on her right, she turned due north, having Cyprus on her left.
