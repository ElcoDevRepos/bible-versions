Their speechlessness indicates the profound impact of the supernatural event they witnessed. In biblical narratives, speechlessness often accompanies divine encounters, reflecting awe and fear (e.g., <a href="/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15</a>). This moment marks a pivotal point in Saul's life, as he transitions from persecutor to apostle. The men&#8217;s reaction underscores the authenticity and gravity of the encounter, as they are unable to articulate what they have experienced.<p><b>They heard the voice but did not see anyone.</b><br>The voice heard by Saul and his companions is identified as the voice of Jesus (<a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>). This auditory experience without a visual manifestation is significant, as it highlights the divine nature of the encounter. In the Old Testament, God often communicated through a voice, such as with Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) or Elijah on Mount Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12-13</a>). The inability to see anyone aligns with the biblical theme that God&#8217;s presence is often unseen yet powerfully felt. This moment also emphasizes the personal nature of Saul's call, as he alone sees the risen Christ (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17, 27</a>). The experience of hearing without seeing can be seen as a test of faith, echoing Jesus' words in <a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>, "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee who persecuted Christians.

Their shared but limited experience authenticates Saul&#8217;s encounter while underscoring that God alone grants understanding and vision. The verse demonstrates both the historicity of Paul&#8217;s conversion and the sovereign, selective revelation of the risen Christ, calling us to trust the God who speaks and reveals according to His wise purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</span>--We are told by St. Paul himself (<a href="/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a>) that they "did <span class= "ital">not</span> hear the voice." What is meant is clearly that they did not hear the words--could attach no meaning to the sounds which for Saul himself had so profound a significance. So, in like manner, they saw the light, but did not see the form. In <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>, they also are said to have fallen on the ground in terror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">That journeyed</span> for <span class="accented">which journeyed</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">the voice</span> for <span class="accented">a voice</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">beholding</span> for <span class="accented">seeing</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Speechless</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (or rather <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) is found nowhere else in the New Testament, but is not uncommon in the LXX. (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>) and in classical Greek. Here it means speechless from terror, struck dumb. The description here given by St. Luke seems to be contradictory in two particulars to St. Paul's own account in <a href="/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> and Acts 26:14. For St. Paul's companions are said here to have "stood speechless;" but in <a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a> they were "all fallen to the earth." Here they "hear the voice," but in <a href="/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> they "heard not the voice of him that spake." It is obvious, however, that in such descriptions all depends upon the particular moment of the transaction described which happens to be uppermost in the mind of the speaker or writer at the time, and the particular purpose in relation to which he is giving the description. Thus at one moment the spectators might be standing dumfounded, and at the next they might be prostrate on the ground, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> Either description of their attitude would be a true one, though not true with regard to the same moment. Again, if the purpose of the speaker was to affirm that the whole company were conscious of both the vision and the sound of a voice speaking, but that only Saul saw the Divine Speaker, the description "hearing the voice, but beholding no man" would be the natural one. Whereas, if the purpose was to express that Saul alone heard the words spoken to him by the Lord, the description of his companions," They saw indeed the light... but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me," would be equally natural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
