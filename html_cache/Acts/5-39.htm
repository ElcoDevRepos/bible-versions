In the context of <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>, the apostles are spreading the message of Jesus Christ, which has caused concern among the Jewish leaders. The speaker, Gamaliel, a respected Pharisee and teacher of the law, suggests that if the apostles' mission is truly from God, it will succeed regardless of human opposition. This reflects a broader biblical theme that God's purposes cannot be thwarted by human efforts, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>, where it states that God's plans will stand.<p><b>you will not be able to stop them.</b><br>Here, the inevitability of God's will is emphasized. The apostles, empowered by the Holy Spirit, are carrying out the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), and their success is assured if their mission is divinely ordained. This echoes the unstoppable nature of God's plans, as seen in the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where what was meant for harm, God used for good. The early church's growth, despite persecution, is a testament to this principle.<p><b>You may even find yourselves fighting against God.&#8221;</b><br>This warning highlights the danger of opposing God's work. Gamaliel cautions the Sanhedrin that resisting the apostles could mean opposing God Himself. This reflects the biblical understanding that God is sovereign and His purposes will prevail, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, which states that no wisdom, understanding, or counsel can prevail against the Lord. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the futility of resisting God's will, as illustrated in the story of Jonah, who initially fled from God's command but ultimately fulfilled it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gamaliel.htm">Gamaliel</a></b><br>A respected Pharisee and teacher of the law, who was a member of the Sanhedrin.
