The context is the aftermath of Peter's sermon following the healing of a lame man at the temple gate called Beautiful. The Sadducees, who were part of the ruling class and did not believe in the resurrection, were particularly disturbed by the apostles' teaching about Jesus' resurrection. This act of seizing reflects the tension between the early Christian movement and the Jewish authorities. It also echoes the earlier arrest of Jesus, highlighting the continuity of opposition faced by His followers.<p><b>and because it was evening</b><br>The timing of the arrest is significant. Jewish law, based on the Mishnah, prohibited trials at night, which is why the authorities waited until the next day to deal with Peter and John. This detail underscores the legalistic adherence to Jewish customs, even as they sought to suppress the burgeoning Christian faith. The evening setting also parallels the arrest of Jesus, which took place at night, suggesting a pattern of opposition that the apostles would continue to face.<p><b>they put them in custody until the next day</b><br>This action demonstrates the authorities' intent to control the situation and prevent any further public disturbance. The custody likely took place in a holding area within the temple complex or nearby, as the Sanhedrin would convene there. This temporary imprisonment reflects the growing hostility towards the apostles and the message of Jesus Christ. It also sets the stage for the subsequent trial, where Peter and John would boldly testify to the power and authority of Jesus, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy that His followers would be brought before rulers and authorities for His name's sake (<a href="/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his boldness and leadership in the early church.
