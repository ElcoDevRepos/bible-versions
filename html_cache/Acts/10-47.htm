The context is Peter's vision and subsequent visit to Cornelius, a Roman centurion, which signifies the breaking of Jewish-Gentile barriers. Baptism, a rite of initiation into the Christian faith, symbolizes purification and the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The question underscores the universality of the gospel, as Peter recognizes that no human tradition or prejudice should prevent those whom God has accepted from being baptized. This moment marks a pivotal shift in the early church's understanding of God's plan for salvation, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have!</b><br>The reception of the Holy Spirit by Cornelius and his household is a significant event, demonstrating that God's gift is not limited by ethnicity or cultural background. This mirrors the experience of the apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2), where the Holy Spirit was poured out, empowering them for ministry. The phrase "just as we have" emphasizes the equality of Gentile believers with Jewish believers, affirming that the same Spirit who empowered the apostles is now at work among the Gentiles. This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people. It also reflects the promise of <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus tells His disciples they will be His witnesses to the ends of the earth, indicating the global scope of the gospel. The inclusion of Gentiles without the prerequisite of adhering to Jewish law foreshadows the decisions made at the Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the early church leaders affirm that salvation is through grace alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who plays a central role in the early church and is the speaker in this verse.

Could the outward sign be refused, when thus the inward and spiritual grace had been so manifestly bestowed? Ordinarily, as in the case of the Samaritans (<a href="/context/acts/8-15.htm" title="Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:">Acts 8:15-17</a>), the gift of spiritual powers followed, by the subsequent act of laying on of hands, on the grace given in baptism. Now even that gift had been anticipated, and all that remained was the outward act of incorporation with the society which owned Christ as its Head. While the history thus bore its witness that the gifts of God may flow through other channels than the outward forms which Christ had appointed, it testified no less clearly that no spiritual gifts, however marvellous, superseded the necessity of obedience to the law of Christ which had appointed those outward forms. The exceptional gift was bestowed, in this instance, to remove the scruples which "those of the circumcision" might otherwise have felt as to admitting Gentiles, as such, to baptism; and having served that purpose, as a crucial instance, was never afterwards, so far as we know, repeated under like conditions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="accented">The water</span> for <span class="accented">water</span>, A.V.
