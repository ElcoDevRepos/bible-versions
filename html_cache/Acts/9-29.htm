These Jews were often more open to philosophical discussions, which is why Paul, with his background in both Jewish and Greek education, was well-suited to engage with them. This interaction reflects Paul's strategy of first reaching out to the Jewish community in each city he visited, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>. The term "debated" indicates a formal discussion, suggesting that Paul was using reason and scripture to argue for Jesus as the Messiah, similar to his approach in <a href="/acts/17-17.htm">Acts 17:17</a> in Athens.<p><b>but they tried to kill him</b><br>This phrase underscores the intense opposition Paul faced from the Jewish community, a recurring theme in his ministry. The hostility from the Grecian Jews can be linked to their perception of Paul as a threat to their religious traditions and authority, as seen in <a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-15</a>, where a group of Jews conspires to kill him. This attempt on Paul's life also echoes the broader pattern of persecution faced by early Christians, as Jesus predicted in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>.
