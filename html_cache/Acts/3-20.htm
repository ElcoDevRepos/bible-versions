The "times of refreshing" can be seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35:1-10</a>, where the desert is transformed into a fertile land, symbolizing spiritual rejuvenation. The presence of the Lord is often associated with divine intervention and blessing, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>, where God's presence is promised to bring rest. This phrase also connects to the idea of the Holy Spirit's work in the believer's life, bringing comfort and renewal (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>and that He may send Jesus</b><br>This part of the verse points to the second coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. The sending of Jesus is a fulfillment of the promise of His return, as mentioned in <a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a> and <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>. The early church lived with the expectation of Christ's imminent return, which provided hope and motivation for holy living. This expectation is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Himself, who spoke of His return in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>.<p><b>the Christ</b><br>The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This title affirms Jesus' role as the promised deliverer and king prophesied in the Old Testament. Passages such as <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a> speak of the Messiah's anointing and mission. Recognizing Jesus as the Christ is central to Christian faith, as it acknowledges Him as the fulfillment of messianic prophecies and the one who brings salvation to humanity.<p><b>who has been appointed for you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine plan and purpose in Jesus' mission. The appointment of Jesus is part of God's sovereign will, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, which speak of God's predestined plan for salvation. The personal nature of "for you" highlights the individual and communal aspect of salvation, indicating that Jesus' mission was intended for the audience of Peter's sermon and, by extension, for all believers. This appointment underscores the grace and intentionality of God's redemptive work through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were instrumental in the early church and were speaking to the people in the temple area.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jews in Jerusalem, where Peter and John were preaching.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Messiah, whose life, death, and resurrection are central to the Christian faith.
