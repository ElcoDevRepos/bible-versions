The timing underscores the miraculous nature of the events and the jailer's immediate response to the gospel message. In the ancient world, nighttime was typically a period of rest, making the jailer's actions even more significant as they break from the norm.<p><b>the jailer took them</b><br>The jailer, responsible for Paul and Silas, shows a dramatic change in behavior. Initially, he was part of the oppressive system, but now he becomes a caretaker. This transformation highlights the power of the gospel to change hearts and roles. The jailer's actions reflect a newfound compassion and responsibility, aligning with the Christian call to love and serve others.<p><b>and washed their wounds</b><br>This act of washing signifies both physical and spiritual cleansing. The wounds were likely from the severe beating Paul and Silas received, as described earlier in the chapter. The jailer's washing of their wounds symbolizes repentance and a desire to make amends. It also reflects the biblical theme of healing and restoration, seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where the Messiah's suffering brings healing.<p><b>And without delay</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the urgency and importance of baptism in the early Christian community. The immediate response to the gospel message is a hallmark of genuine faith and conversion. This urgency is consistent with other New Testament accounts, such as the Ethiopian eunuch in <a href="/acts/8-36.htm">Acts 8:36-38</a>, who also sought baptism immediately after understanding the gospel.<p><b>he and all his household</b><br>The inclusion of the jailer's household indicates the communal nature of faith in the early church. Households often included extended family and servants, suggesting that the gospel message reached a broader audience. This reflects the biblical principle of household salvation, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-14.htm">Acts 11:14</a> with Cornelius' household, and underscores the impact of one person's faith on their entire family.<p><b>were baptized</b><br>Baptism here is a public declaration of faith and an outward sign of inward transformation. It signifies identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as explained in <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>. The act of baptism is a fulfillment of the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This event marks the jailer's and his household's entry into the Christian community, symbolizing new life and commitment to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Two apostles who were imprisoned in Philippi for casting out a spirit from a slave girl.

Salvation meets the jailer in the dark, reminding us that no hour is off-limits for God (<a href="/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timing often interrupts our schedules; grace does not wait for daylight.<p>&#8226; The urgency of the gospel is underscored&#8212;when conviction comes, response follows immediately.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The jailer took them</b><p>Moments earlier he &#8220;drew his sword and was about to kill himself&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a>).

Like the Ethiopian who said, &#8220;Look, here is water. What is to prevent me from being baptized?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-36.htm">Acts 8:36</a>), the jailer refuses to postpone obedience (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>&#8226; Delayed obedience is disobedience; a living faith acts at once.<p>&#8226; Grace quickens the will&#8212;God works, and we respond in the same moment (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He and all his household were baptized</b><p>This household echoes Cornelius&#8217;s (<a href="/acts/10-47.htm">Acts 10:47-48</a>) and Crispus&#8217;s (<a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>). Scripture records entire families embracing Christ together, fulfilling the promise that &#8220;the word of the Lord is for you and for your children&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>) and resonating with Joshua&#8217;s declaration, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Baptism is a public testimony of faith, not a work that saves (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), yet it is commanded as the first step of discipleship (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s design reaches beyond individuals to households, communities, and nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33</a> shows the jailer&#8217;s midnight conversion moving from conviction to compassion to covenant&#8212;all in a single, grace-saturated night.

He, too, was cleansed from wounds which were worse than those inflicted by the rods of the Roman lictors. No certain answer can be given to the question whether the baptism was by immersion or affusion. A public prison was likely enough to contain a bath or pool of some kind, where the former would be feasible. What has been said above (see Note on <a href="/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.">Acts 16:15</a>) as to the bearing of these narratives on the question of infant baptism applies here also, with the additional fact that those who are said to have been baptised are obviously identical with those whom St. Paul addressed (the word "all" is used in each case), and must, therefore, have been of an age to receive instruction together with the gaoler himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- Immediately</span> for <span class="accented">straightway</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Washed their stripes</span>.
