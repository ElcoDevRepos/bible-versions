This title underscores their authority and mission to spread the Gospel. The context here is their missionary journey in Lystra, where a miraculous healing led the local population to mistake them for gods. The phrase "found out about this" refers to the realization that the people of Lystra were preparing to offer sacrifices to them, believing Barnabas to be Zeus and Paul to be Hermes. This misunderstanding highlights the cultural and religious environment of the time, where polytheism was prevalent, and divine intervention was often attributed to familiar deities.<p><b>they tore their clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes is a traditional Jewish expression of grief, horror, or outrage, often in response to blasphemy or extreme distress. This act by Barnabas and Paul signifies their deep dismay at being mistaken for gods, which directly contradicts their message of monotheism and the worship of the one true God. This reaction aligns with Jewish customs found in the Old Testament, such as when Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in <a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6</a> in response to the Israelites' rebellion.<p><b>and rushed into the crowd</b><br>Their immediate and urgent response to the situation demonstrates their commitment to correcting the misunderstanding and preventing idolatry. The act of rushing into the crowd shows their courage and determination to address the issue directly, despite the potential danger from a frenzied mob. This reflects the apostles' dedication to their mission and their willingness to confront challenges head-on.<p><b>shouting</b><br>The use of shouting indicates the urgency and intensity of their message. In a bustling and chaotic environment, raising their voices was necessary to capture the attention of the crowd and convey the seriousness of their message. This action underscores the importance of their proclamation and their desire to redirect the people's worship away from themselves and towards God. The apostles' boldness in proclaiming the truth is a recurring theme in Acts, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>, where they pray for boldness to speak God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of Paul.
