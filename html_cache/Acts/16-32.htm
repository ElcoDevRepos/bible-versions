Paul, formerly Saul of Tarsus, was a Pharisee who converted to Christianity after an encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. Silas, also known as Silvanus, was a leader in the early church and a companion of Paul on his second missionary journey. Their partnership highlights the importance of collaboration in ministry.<p><b>spoke the word of the Lord</b><br>This phrase indicates the proclamation of the Gospel message, which centers on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The "word of the Lord" refers to the teachings and truths about Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. This act of speaking the word is a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructed His disciples to spread His teachings to all nations.<p><b>to him</b><br>The "him" in this context is the Philippian jailer, who had been on the verge of suicide after an earthquake opened the prison doors. His encounter with Paul and Silas led to a dramatic conversion experience. This moment underscores the transformative power of the Gospel, capable of reaching individuals in their most desperate moments.<p><b>and to everyone in his house</b><br>The inclusion of the jailer's household signifies the communal nature of early Christian conversions. In the cultural context of the time, households often included extended family and servants, indicating that the message of salvation was extended to all, regardless of social status. This reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel, as seen in other household conversions in Acts, such as Cornelius's family (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24, 44</a>-48).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Two apostles who were imprisoned in Philippi for casting out a spirit from a slave girl.

Their worship in the night (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>) and refusal to flee afterward demonstrate faith in action, giving their words credibility.

In the wake of crisis, Paul and Silas deliver God&#8217;s saving word without hesitation; their battered bodies authenticate their message; the jailer hears a personal call; and his whole household is invited into the same grace. The verse assures us that whenever and wherever the word of the Lord is spoken, God stands ready to save&#8212;one life at a time, and whole families together.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And they spake unto him the word of the Lord.</span>--It is clear that belief in the Lord Jesus Christ, unless it were to be a mere formula, repeated as a charm, required an explanation. The very title of Christ; the acts and words that showed that Jesus was the Christ; His life, and death, and resurrection; the truths of forgiveness of sins and communion with Him, and the outward signs which He had appointed as witnesses of those truths; all this must have been included in "the word of the Lord," which was preached to that congregation so strangely assembled, between the hours of midnight and of dawn.
