The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a place where theological discussions often occurred. Paul emphasizes that he was not causing disturbances there, highlighting his respect for Jewish customs and the sanctity of the temple.

Paul often preached in synagogues during his missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5, 14</a>; 14:1), but here he asserts that he was not inciting unrest. This claim counters the accusations of being a troublemaker, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6-7</a>, where he was accused of turning the world upside down. His approach was to reason and persuade, not to incite.<p><b>or in the city</b><br>Paul extends his defense to the broader context of the city, likely referring to Jerusalem. The city was a hub of religious and political activity, and any disturbance could have significant implications. By stating he did not cause trouble in the city, Paul underscores his peaceful conduct.
