The involvement of two centurions indicates a significant military operation, reflecting the importance of the mission. This action underscores the Roman commitment to maintaining order and protecting their interests, including the safety of Paul, a Roman citizen. The centurions' role here highlights the Roman influence and authority in Judea during this period.<p><b>Prepare two hundred soldiers</b><br>The deployment of 200 soldiers signifies the seriousness of the situation. This large number of troops was likely intended to ensure Paul's safe passage and to deter any potential threats from the Jewish leaders who were plotting against him. The presence of such a force illustrates the tension between the early Christian movement and the Jewish authorities, as well as the Roman Empire's role as a protector of its citizens.<p><b>seventy horsemen</b><br>The inclusion of seventy horsemen indicates the need for speed and mobility. Horsemen, or cavalry, were crucial for rapid movement and could provide a swift response to any ambushes. This detail reflects the urgency and danger of the mission, as well as the Roman military's strategic planning. The use of cavalry also emphasizes the importance of Paul's mission and the lengths to which the Romans would go to ensure his safety.<p><b>and two hundred spearmen</b><br>Spearmen, or light infantry, were versatile soldiers who could engage in both ranged and close combat. Their inclusion in the escort highlights the potential for conflict and the need for a well-rounded military force. This detail underscores the threat level perceived by the Roman authorities and their determination to protect Paul from any harm.<p><b>to go to Caesarea</b><br>Caesarea was the Roman administrative capital of Judea, located on the Mediterranean coast. It was a significant city, built by Herod the Great, and served as the residence of the Roman governor. The decision to send Paul to Caesarea indicates a transfer of jurisdiction and a move to a more secure location. This city was a hub of Roman power and influence, making it a strategic choice for Paul's protection and further legal proceedings.<p><b>in the third hour of the night</b><br>The third hour of the night corresponds to approximately 9 PM. Traveling at night would have provided cover and reduced the likelihood of encountering hostile forces. This timing reflects the urgency and secrecy of the mission, as well as the Roman authorities' desire to avoid any public disturbances. Night travel also symbolizes the darkness of the threats against Paul and the light of divine protection guiding him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being protected and transported due to a plot against his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/claudius_lysias.htm">Claudius Lysias</a></b><br>The Roman commander in Jerusalem who orders the protection and transfer of Paul to Caesarea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurions.htm">Centurions</a></b><br>Roman officers each commanding a century (approximately 100 soldiers), tasked with organizing the escort.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>A significant Roman city and the destination for Paul's transfer, serving as the administrative center of the province.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Paul is initially held and where the plot against him is discovered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God's sovereignty is evident in the protection of Paul.

This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). "Holding or taking the right" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and with that of Beza, "Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply <span class="accented">latus</span>] munit." Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
