The Holy Spirit's instruction to Peter reflects the divine initiative in breaking Jewish-Gentile barriers, aligning with the vision Peter received in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. The phrase "without hesitation" underscores the urgency and importance of obedience to God's command, reminiscent of Abraham's immediate response to God's call in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>. This divine direction is crucial in the narrative, as it leads to the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a> about being a light to the nations.<p><b>These six brothers also went with me,</b><br>The mention of "six brothers" provides a legal and communal witness to the events that transpired, as Jewish law often required multiple witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This detail underscores the importance of accountability and shared testimony in the early Church. The presence of these brothers also highlights the communal nature of the early Christian mission, where significant actions were taken with the support and verification of the community. This aligns with the practice seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the Jerusalem Council deliberates on Gentile inclusion with multiple witnesses and testimonies.<p><b>and we entered the man&#8217;s home.</b><br>Entering a Gentile's home was a significant cultural and religious boundary for Jews, as it could lead to ceremonial uncleanliness (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>). This act symbolizes the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, a central theme in the book of Acts. It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' ministry, who often crossed social and cultural boundaries (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9-10</a>). This action by Peter and his companions signifies the new covenant in Christ, where all are welcome into the family of God, as echoed in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, which speaks of Christ breaking down the dividing wall of hostility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his experience of being led by the Holy Spirit to visit Cornelius, a Gentile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who directs Peter to go with the men sent by Cornelius.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_six_brothers.htm">The Six Brothers</a></b><br>Jewish believers who accompany Peter to Cornelius's house, serving as witnesses to the event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion whose household becomes the first recorded Gentile group to receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>The city where Cornelius lives, and where Peter travels to meet him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_the_holy_spirit.htm">Obedience to the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Peter's willingness to follow the Spirit's guidance without hesitation is a model for believers.
