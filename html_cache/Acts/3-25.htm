The prophets were God's messengers, and their teachings and prophecies were foundational to Israel's identity. This connection emphasizes the continuity of God's plan through Israel's history. The audience, likely Jewish, would have understood the significance of being linked to figures like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Elijah, who foretold the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>and of the covenant God made with your fathers</b><br>The covenant refers to the promises God made to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This covenant is central to Jewish identity and theology, as it established Israel as God's chosen people. The Abrahamic Covenant included promises of land, descendants, and blessing, which are foundational to understanding God's redemptive plan. This covenant is unconditional, highlighting God's faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness.<p><b>when He said to Abraham</b><br>This phrase points to the specific moment when God made His covenant with Abraham, recorded in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:1-21, and 17:1-14. Abraham is a pivotal figure in biblical history, often called the "father of faith." His faith and obedience set a precedent for future generations. The covenant with Abraham is reiterated throughout Scripture, underscoring its importance in God's plan for humanity.<p><b>&#8216;Through your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.&#8217;</b><br>This promise is a key element of the Abrahamic Covenant, indicating that Abraham's descendants would be a source of blessing to all nations. This prophecy finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham, through whom salvation is offered to all people. The phrase underscores the universal scope of God's redemptive plan, extending beyond Israel to include all nations. This promise is echoed in <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>, where Paul explains that the Gospel was preached in advance to Abraham, highlighting the continuity of God's plan through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage.

Just as in <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a> he said, "The promise is unto you and to your children" (comp. <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>). He thus enforces the solemn obligation of giving heed to what the prophets had said concerning Christ and his kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">In thy seed</span> (see <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). This covenant, into which God entered with Abraham, with an oath (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16, 18</a>), and which was a repetition and amplification of the covenant and promise already recorded in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>; <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1-8</a>, was made <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, with a view to, in the direction of, the fathers, so as to include them and their children after them. It was now fulfilled to those whom St. Peter was addressing, as is set forth in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/3-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And] you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
