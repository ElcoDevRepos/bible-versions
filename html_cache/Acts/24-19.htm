The phrase highlights the legal expectation that accusers should be present to substantiate their claims. This reflects the Roman legal system's emphasis on the right to face one's accusers, a principle that resonates with modern legal practices. Biblically, this aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires the presence of witnesses to establish a matter. The absence of Paul's accusers weakens the case against him, suggesting that the charges may lack substance.<p><b>if they have anything against me</b><br>Paul challenges the validity of the accusations by questioning the presence of any legitimate charges. This phrase underscores the importance of evidence in legal proceedings. Historically, the Jewish leaders' inability to present concrete evidence against Paul reflects the tension between early Christians and Jewish authorities. Culturally, this situation illustrates the early church's struggle for legitimacy and protection under Roman law. Theologically, Paul's defense can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced false accusations and unjust trials. This connection emphasizes the theme of suffering for righteousness, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14-17</a>, where believers are encouraged to endure unjust suffering for the sake of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is on trial, defending himself against accusations made by Jewish leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>- The accusers who have brought charges against Paul, but are notably absent at this point in the trial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/felix.htm">Felix</a></b><br>- The Roman governor presiding over Paul's trial in Caesarea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>- The location where Paul is being held and where the trial is taking place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the initial accusations against Paul were made, and where the Jewish leaders are from.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witnesses.htm">The Importance of Witnesses</a></b><br>The absence of Paul's accusers underscores the biblical principle of requiring witnesses to establish a charge.

According to <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, at least two witnesses must testify to establish a matter. By highlighting their absence, Paul is saying, &#8220;The people who actually saw what happened should be here.&#8221; Their failure to show up exposes the weakness of the case against him, echoing the way Jesus&#8217; accusers contradicted one another (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before you</b><p>Paul is standing before Governor Felix, a recognized civil authority. By insisting that the real witnesses present themselves &#8220;before you,&#8221; Paul affirms both due process and respect for God-ordained government (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>). He is not dodging accountability; instead, he welcomes lawful scrutiny, confident that truth will prevail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bring charges</b><p>Felix must hear specific accusations, not vague rumors. Roman law required an accuser to confront the accused in person (<a href="/acts/25-16.htm">Acts 25:16</a>). Paul is saying, &#8220;Let them come forward and make their case.&#8221; The principle is simple: justice demands clear, substantiated charges, just as Moses required careful examination before judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they have anything against me</b><p>This conditional phrase throws the burden of proof back on the absent accusers. Paul knows they have no legitimate complaint (<a href="/acts/23-29.htm">Acts 23:29</a>; <a href="/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14</a>). His conscience is clear, and he is ready to defend himself openly, trusting that &#8220;those who malign your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s brief sentence exposes the hollowness of the accusations: the real witnesses are missing, lawful authority is being bypassed, and no verifiable charge exists. By calling for proper testimony, Paul upholds both civil order and biblical standards of justice, demonstrating confidence that the truth&#8212;and the Lord&#8212;are fully on his side.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Who ought to have been here before thee.</span>--The originators of the disturbance shrank from the consequences of their actions, and either remained at Jerusalem or else started on their homeward journey as soon as the Feast was over.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- To make accusation</span> for <span class="accented">object</span>, A.V.
