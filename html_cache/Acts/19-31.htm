Officials, or "Asiarchs," were influential leaders responsible for overseeing religious and civic events. Their involvement suggests that Paul's message had reached influential circles, and they were concerned for his safety amidst the unrest in Ephesus.<p><b>sent word to him</b><br>Communication in the ancient world often relied on messengers.

It was the site of the uproar caused by Demetrius and the silversmiths, who were angered by the decline in their trade due to Paul's preaching against idolatry.

The office was an annual one. They were ten in number, and the proconsul nominated one of them as president. Their duties led them now to one city, now to another, according as games or festivals were held, now at Ephesus, now at Colophon, or Smyrna. As connected both with the theatre and with the worship of Artemis, they were probably officially informed of the occasion of the tumult. If, as seems probable from <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, that Epistle was written at, or about, the time of the Passover, we may place the tumult at some period in the spring, when the people were keeping or expecting the great festival in honour of Artemis, in the month, named after the goddess, Artemision, spreading over parts of April and May (Boeckh. <span class= "ital">Corp. Inscript. Graec.</span> 2954), and were therefore more than usually open to excited appeals like that of Demetrius. This would also account for the presence of the Asiarchs at Ephesus.<p>There is something significant in the fact that the Asiarchs were St. Paul's friends. The manliness, tact, and courtesy which tempered his zeal and boldness, seem always to have gained for him the respect of men in authority: Sergius Paulus (<a href="/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>), Gallio (<a href="/context/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14-17</a>), Festus and Agrippa (<a href="/acts/25-9.htm" title="But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?">Acts 25:9</a>; <a href="/acts/26-28.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian.">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="/acts/26-32.htm" title="Then said Agrippa to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.">Acts 26:32</a>), the centurion Julius (<a href="/acts/27-3.htm" title="And the next day we touched at Sidon.
