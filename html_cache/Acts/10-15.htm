In biblical narratives, repetition often signifies divine insistence or urgency. The voice is understood to be God's, communicating directly with Peter. This divine communication is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God speaks directly to individuals, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) or Samuel in the temple (1 Samuel 3). The context here is Peter's vision, which challenges Jewish dietary laws and cultural boundaries.<p><b>Do not call anything impure:</b><br>The term "impure" refers to the Jewish laws of cleanliness found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which distinguish between clean and unclean animals. These laws were central to Jewish identity and religious practice. The command challenges Peter's understanding of purity, which was deeply rooted in the Mosaic Law. This phrase signifies a shift from the old covenant, where certain foods and practices were deemed unclean, to a new understanding in Christ, where such distinctions are abolished.<p><b>that God has made clean:</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's sovereign authority to redefine what is considered clean. It signifies the new covenant established through Jesus Christ, where the ceremonial laws are fulfilled and transcended. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, where He declares all foods clean, pointing to a deeper spiritual purity rather than ritualistic observance. Theologically, this phrase underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel, extending beyond Jewish boundaries to Gentiles, as seen in the subsequent conversion of Cornelius and his household. It also prefigures the unity of all believers in Christ, as articulated in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile is broken down.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who is staying in Joppa at the house of Simon the tanner.
