The "way of the Lord" refers to the early Christian teachings and the path of righteousness as understood in the context of the New Testament. This instruction likely included the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, which Apollos, being a Jew from Alexandria, would have been familiar with. Alexandria was a center of learning and had a significant Jewish population, which suggests that Apollos had access to substantial religious education.<p><b>and was fervent in spirit</b><br>Apollos's fervency in spirit suggests a passionate and enthusiastic commitment to his faith. This fervency is reminiscent of the zeal seen in other biblical figures, such as Paul, who was also known for his passionate dedication to spreading the Gospel. The phrase "fervent in spirit" can also imply that Apollos was guided by the Holy Spirit, which empowered him to speak boldly and effectively. This fervency is crucial for effective ministry and is encouraged in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>, which urges believers to be "fervent in spirit, serving the Lord."<p><b>He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus</b><br>Despite his limited knowledge, Apollos was able to teach accurately about Jesus, indicating a strong understanding of the Messianic prophecies and the life and teachings of Jesus. This accuracy in teaching is essential for the integrity of the Gospel message and is a theme echoed throughout the New Testament, where sound doctrine is emphasized (e.g., <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2-3</a>). Apollos's ability to teach accurately suggests that he was a skilled orator and knowledgeable in the Scriptures, which would have been vital for his role in the early church.<p><b>though he knew only the baptism of John</b><br>This phrase highlights a limitation in Apollos's understanding. The baptism of John was a baptism of repentance, preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>). It did not include the full revelation of Christian baptism, which involves the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). This indicates that Apollos's knowledge was incomplete, lacking the understanding of the baptism in the name of Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit, which were central to the apostolic teaching (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). This gap in knowledge was later addressed by Priscilla and Aquila, who explained to him "the way of God more accurately" (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apollos.htm">Apollos</a></b><br>A learned Jew from Alexandria, known for his eloquence and knowledge of the Scriptures.

Apollos&#8217; enthusiasm prepared him for further correction without pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus</b><p>Even with incomplete knowledge, Apollos communicated what he knew with precision and faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Luke describes him as &#8220;powerful in the Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24</a>), showing disciplined study.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> had earlier proclaimed, &#8220;God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#8221; Apollos echoed that core gospel fact.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a> records Paul saying, &#8220;I planted the seed and Apollos watered it,&#8221; confirming that his teaching was trustworthy enough to nurture believers.<p>Accuracy matters; it guards listeners from error and honors the God who &#8220;cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>).

We ask in what the teaching, which is thus described as accurate, was yet defective. The position of Apollos at this stage was, it would seem, that of one who knew the facts of our Lord's life, and death, and resurrection, and had learnt, comparing these with Messianic prophecies, to accept Him as the Christ. But his teacher had been one who had not gone beyond the standpoint of the followers of the Baptist, who accepted Jesus as the Christ during His ministry on earth. The Christ was for him the head of a glorified Judaism, retaining all its distinctive features. He had not as yet learnt that "circumcision was nothing" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), and that the Temple and all its ordinances were "decaying and waxing old, and ready to vanish away" (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> <span class="accented">- Had been</span> for was, A.V.; <span class="accented">spirit</span> for <span class="accented">the spirit</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">carefully</span> for <span class="accented">diligently</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">things concerning Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">things of the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him</span> for <span class="accented">whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">carefully</span> for <span class="accented">perfectly</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing only the baptism of John</span>. It is difficult at first sight to conceive how at this time any one could know the baptism of John without knowing further that of Christ. But a possible account of it is that Apollos living at Alexandria, where as yet there was no Christian Church. had met some Jews who had been in Judaea at the time of John's ministry, and had heard from them of John's baptism and preaching, and of his testimony to Jesus as the Messiah, but had had no further opportunity of careful instruction in the faith of Jesus Christ till he happened to come to Ephesus and make the acquaintance of his compatriots, Aquila and Priscilla. They hearing him speak with fervor and eloquence, but perceiving that his knowledge was imperfect, immediately invited him to their house, and instructed him in the fullness of the truth of the gospel. This necessarily included the doctrine of Christian baptism, which we cannot doubt was administered to him (<a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; <a href="/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">had been</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
