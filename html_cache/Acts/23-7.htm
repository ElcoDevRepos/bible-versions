This belief was a central tenet of Pharisaic doctrine but was rejected by the Sadducees. Paul's strategic mention of the resurrection was intended to create a division among his accusers, highlighting the theological rift between the two groups. This tactic reflects Paul's deep understanding of Jewish sects and their beliefs.<p><b>a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees</b><br>The Pharisees and Sadducees were two prominent Jewish sects during the Second Temple period. The Pharisees believed in the resurrection, angels, and spirits, while the Sadducees denied these doctrines, focusing instead on the written Torah and rejecting oral traditions. This theological disagreement was significant and often led to conflicts. The dispute here underscores the deep-seated divisions within the Jewish leadership and highlights the contentious nature of religious debates at the time.<p><b>and the assembly was divided</b><br>The assembly, likely the Sanhedrin, was the highest Jewish council in Jerusalem, composed of both Pharisees and Sadducees. The division within the assembly illustrates the lack of unity among the Jewish leaders and their inability to present a united front against Paul. This division also serves to protect Paul temporarily, as the focus shifts from him to the internal conflict. Theologically, this division can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>, where He speaks of bringing division, even among close groups, due to differing beliefs about Him and His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on trial and strategically mentions his belief in the resurrection to create division among his accusers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their strict adherence to the Law and belief in the resurrection, angels, and spirits.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect that denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits, often associated with the priestly and aristocratic classes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The assembly or council of Jewish leaders, including both Pharisees and Sadducees, before whom Paul is brought.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a central location for Jewish religious and political life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_strategic_wisdom.htm">The Power of Strategic Wisdom</a></b><br>Paul uses his knowledge of the theological differences between the Pharisees and Sadducees to his advantage.
