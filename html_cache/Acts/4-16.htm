The Sanhedrin, composed of Pharisees and Sadducees, was responsible for maintaining religious order and authority. Their question reflects their dilemma: they are confronted with undeniable evidence of divine power but are reluctant to accept the implications. This echoes the broader theme of resistance to Jesus' ministry and the early church, as seen in the Gospels and Acts. The question also highlights the tension between human authority and divine intervention, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;It is clear to everyone living in Jerusalem&#8221;</b><br>The miracle performed by Peter and John was not done in secret; it was witnessed by many in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life. Jerusalem holds significant historical and theological importance as the city where God chose to place His name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>) and where the temple stood. The public nature of the miracle underscores the transparency and authenticity of the apostles' ministry, contrasting with the secretive and often deceptive practices of the religious leaders. This public acknowledgment also fulfills Jesus' promise that His followers would perform greater works (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>).<p><b>&#8220;that a remarkable miracle has occurred through them&#8221;</b><br>The miracle in question is the healing of a man lame from birth, as described earlier in <a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3</a>. This act of healing serves as a sign of the apostles' authority and the power of the Holy Spirit working through them. Miracles in the New Testament often serve as a validation of the message being preached, pointing to the truth of the Gospel and the presence of God's kingdom. The term "remarkable" emphasizes the extraordinary nature of the event, which could not be explained by natural means and thus pointed to divine intervention.<p><b>&#8220;and we cannot deny it.&#8221;</b><br>The Sanhedrin's admission that they cannot deny the miracle highlights the undeniable evidence of God's work through the apostles. Despite their authority and desire to suppress the spread of Christianity, they are confronted with the reality of God's power. This acknowledgment parallels the Pharisees' reaction to Jesus' miracles, where they often could not refute the acts themselves but questioned the source (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>). The inability to deny the miracle serves as a testament to the truth of the apostles' message and the unstoppable nature of God's plan, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were performing miracles and preaching the resurrection of Jesus, causing a stir among the Jewish leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, consisting of chief priests, elders, and scribes, who were responsible for maintaining religious order and were questioning Peter and John.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and the location where the events of <a href="/bsb/acts/4.htm">Acts 4</a> take place.
