This trial is part of a series of legal proceedings that began in Jerusalem and continued in Caesarea. Paul's trials reflect the early Christian experience of persecution and the legal challenges faced by the apostles. His defense is not just personal but also a testimony to the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>because of my hope</b><br>The "hope" Paul refers to is the resurrection of the dead, a central tenet of Christian faith. This hope is rooted in the promises of God and is a fulfillment of Jewish eschatological expectations. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, where Paul elaborates on its significance.<p><b>in the promise that God made</b><br>The promise refers to the covenantal promises made by God throughout the Old Testament. These include the promise of a Messiah, the restoration of Israel, and the ultimate redemption of humanity. Paul's message is that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of these promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>, where Jesus explains how He fulfills the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.<p><b>to our fathers</b><br>"Our fathers" refers to the patriarchs of Israel&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and the prophets who followed. The promises made to them are foundational to Jewish identity and hope. Paul connects the Christian message to these ancient promises, emphasizing continuity rather than a break with Jewish tradition. This connection is also seen in <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>, where Paul discusses the relationship between Israel and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Paul is defending himself before King Agrippa.
