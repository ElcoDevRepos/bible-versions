The early church, led by Peter, sought divine guidance in choosing a successor, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the number of apostles at twelve, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. This reflects the early church's commitment to order and continuity in leadership.<p><b>Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus):</b><br>Joseph, also known as Barsabbas and Justus, is one of the two candidates considered for apostleship. The multiple names suggest a common practice in the ancient world where individuals had both Jewish and Roman names, reflecting the cultural and linguistic diversity of the early Christian community. The name Barsabbas may indicate a familial or regional connection, while Justus is a Roman name meaning "just" or "righteous," highlighting his character.<p><b>and Matthias:</b><br>Matthias is the other candidate proposed to replace Judas. His selection is significant as it underscores the early church's reliance on prayer and casting lots to discern God's will, a practice rooted in Old Testament traditions (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a>, <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Matthias's inclusion among the apostles fulfills the need for twelve witnesses to the resurrection, maintaining the symbolic and prophetic structure established by Jesus. His appointment, though not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament, signifies the importance of faithfulness and readiness to serve in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_called_barsabbas.htm">Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus)</a></b><br>A candidate proposed to replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles.

Verse 24 shows they will soon pray, &#8220;You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen&#8221;.<p>- The verb &#8220;proposed&#8221; reflects orderly decision-making inside the fellowship, echoing how the early church later &#8220;chose&#8221; the Seven in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>.<p>- Cross reference <a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>, which lays out the qualifications: the replacement must have been with Jesus &#8220;beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up,&#8221; and must be a witness of the resurrection (see also <a href="/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two men</b><p>- Presenting a pair honors the biblical principle that &#8220;Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; compare <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>).<p>- Having more than one candidate keeps the selection process transparent and prevents human favoritism; ultimately the Lord will make the choice (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>).<p>- The number also reminds us of Jesus sending disciples out &#8220;two by two&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), underscoring partnership in ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus)</b><p>- Joseph&#8217;s triple-name suggests he was well known among the believers. &#8220;Barsabbas&#8221; likely links him to his father (&#8220;son of Sabbas&#8221;), while &#8220;Justus&#8221; is a Roman surname meaning &#8220;upright,&#8221; hinting at a respected character.<p>- He meets the apostolic criteria, meaning he faithfully followed Jesus for years yet remained in relative obscurity&#8212;an encouraging picture of hidden but steady discipleship (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>- Another &#8220;Barsabbas,&#8221; Judas, appears later as a trusted leader sent with Paul and Barnabas (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>). Though not identical persons, the repetition shows a family regarded for reliability.<p>- Even though Joseph is not chosen, Scripture offers no hint of resentment; he simply continues serving, modeling humility (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Matthias</b><p>- Matthias&#8217;s name means &#8220;gift of God,&#8221; fitting for someone selected by divine lot (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>).<p>- He, too, had walked with Jesus from the beginning, demonstrating that years of quiet faithfulness often precede public appointment (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>- After his selection, Acts records no further details about him, reminding us that significance in God&#8217;s kingdom is measured by obedience, not by prominence (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>- His addition restores the symbolic fullness of twelve, paralleling the twelve tribes of Israel and anticipating the apostolic foundation mentioned in <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a> shows the early church acting in unity, guided by Scripture and prayer, to nominate qualified men for apostolic service. Presenting Joseph and Matthias highlights the value God places on long-term, faithful discipleship and on processes that seek His will above human preference. The verse assures believers today that the Lord sees quiet faithfulness and sovereignly assigns each servant to the role He has perfectly prepared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">They appointed.</span>--It is uncertain whether this was the act of the Apostles, presenting the two men to the choice of the whole body of disciples, or of the community choosing them for ultimate decision by lot.<p><span class= "bld">Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus.</span>--Some MSS. give the various-reading of "Joses," which was, perhaps, only another form of the same name. Nothing further is known of him. The conditions of the case make it certain that he must have been a disciple almost from the beginning of our Lord's ministry, and that he must have become more or less prominent, and probable therefore, as stated by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> i. 12), that he was one of the Seventy. The name Barsabas (= son of the oath, or of wisdom) may have been a patronymic, like Barjona, or may have been given, like Barnabas, as denoting character. It appears again in Judas Barsabas of <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>, and on the former assumption, the two disciples may have been brothers. The epithet Justus, the just one, is significant, as possibly indicating, as in the case of James the Just, a specially high standard of ascetic holiness. Another with the same surname--Jesus surnamed Justus--meets us as being with St. Paul at Rome as one of "the circumcision" (<a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>), and another, or possibly the same, at Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>). In both cases the use of the Latin instead of the Greek word is noticeable, as indicating some point of contact with the Romans in Judaea or elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">Matthias.</span>--Here, too, probably, the same conditions were fulfilled. The name, like Matthew (see Note on <a href="/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.">Matthew 9:9</a>), signified "given by Jehovah," and had become, in various forms, popular, from the fame of Mattathias, the great head of the Maccabean family.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Put forward</span> for <span class="accented">appointed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Barsabbas</span> for <span class="accented">Barsabas</span>, A.V. and T.R. Joseph called <span class="cmt_word">Barsabbas</span> (or Barsabas). Nothing more is really known of him. His work for Christ has no earthly record, except that Papias (Euseb., 'H.E.,' 3:39) says that, having drunk some deadly poison, by the grace of God he sustained no harm. Eusebius elsewhere (<a href="/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>) says that he and Matthias were reported to be of the seventy, which is not improbable. The derivation of the name Barsabas, or Barsabbas, is unknown; it seems to be a patronymic (son of Sabas, or Sabbas), like Bar-Tholomew, Bar-Jonas, Bar-Jesus, etc. But it might also be descriptive of his qualities, like Barnabas, Son of Consolation (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), in which case one would expect it to mean the same as <span class="cmt_word">Justus</span>, as in the case of "Thomas called <span class="accented">Didymus"</span> (<a href="/john/20-4.htm">John 20:4</a>; where <span class="accented">Thomas</span> and <span class="accented">Di-dymus</span> both mean "a twin"); but no Aramean word of this signification is forthcoming. The surname Justus, with its derivatives Justinus and Justinianus, was not an uncommon Roman name. It was also borne by a Jewish historian contemporary with Josephus, Justus of Tiberias, the son of Pistus (see 'Life of Josephus,'&sect;&sect; 35, 65) and was the surname of James the Less. <span class="cmt_word">Matthias</span> not otherwise known, but said by Nicephorus to have preached and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia. Eusebius ('H. E.,'3:24) mentions spurious Gospels "of Peter, Thomas, Matthias, and others," as quoted by heretics. A work called 'The Traditions of Matthias'is referred to by Clemens Alexandrinus ('Strom.,' 2:163). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they proposed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(est&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2476.htm">Strong's 2476: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary stao stah'-o; to stand, used in various applications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two [men]:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#973;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(dyo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1417.htm">Strong's 1417: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two.
