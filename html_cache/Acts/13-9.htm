Saul, a Hebrew name, was his original name, reflecting his Jewish heritage and Pharisaic background (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). The name Paul, a Roman name, signifies his mission to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This dual naming highlights the apostle's role in bridging Jewish and Gentile communities, fulfilling the prophecy of being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The use of both names underscores the universality of the Gospel message.<p><b>filled with the Holy Spirit</b><br>The phrase indicates divine empowerment and guidance. The Holy Spirit's filling is a recurring theme in Acts, signifying God's presence and authority in the apostles' ministry (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4, 4</a>:31). This filling equips Paul for the confrontation with Elymas, demonstrating the Spirit's role in empowering believers to overcome opposition and perform God's work.

Elymas, also known as Bar-Jesus, was a sorcerer and false prophet opposing the Gospel (<a href="/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-8</a>). Paul's direct gaze indicates a confrontation with evil, reminiscent of Jesus' authority over demonic forces (<a href="/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25-27</a>). This moment highlights the spiritual battle between truth and deception, with Paul, empowered by the Holy Spirit, confronting the forces of darkness.

It presented many advantages. (1) It was sufficiently like his own name in sound to fall within the general practice which turned Jesus into Jason, Hillel into Pollio, Silas into Silvanus. (2) It was a Roman, not a Greek, name, and as such fell in with the ultimate work of the Apostle, already, it may be, contemplated in thought (comp. <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>), of bearing his witness to Christ in the imperial city. (3) It formed a link between him and the illustrious convert whom he had just made. He was, as it were, claiming a brotherhood with him. From this point of view, it is interesting to compare the name of Lucas or Lucanus, as borne both by the evangelist and the poet. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke, V</span>ol. I., p. 237.) Other reasons that have been assigned, as (1) that the Greek word <span class= "ital">Saulos</span> had an opprobrious meaning, as = wanton, or (2) that the meaning of Paulus, as = little, commended itself to the Apostle's humility, may be dismissed as more or less fantastic.<p><span class= "bld">Filled with the Holy Ghost.</span>--The tense of the Greek participle, implies a sudden access of spiritual power, showing itself at once in insight into character, righteous indignation, and prevision of the divine chastisement.<p><span class= "bld">Set his eyes on him.</span>--The word is that already so often noted, as in <a href="/acts/1-10.htm" title="And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;">Acts 1:10</a>, and elsewhere. As applied to St. Paul it may possibly connect itself with the defect of vision which remained as the after-consequence of the brightness seen on the way to Damascus. The Greek word, however, it is right to add, may just as well express the fixed gaze of men of strong powers of sight, as that of those who suffer from some infirmity. (See <a href="/acts/1-10.htm" title="And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="/acts/3-4.htm" title="And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.">Acts 3:4</a>; <a href="/luke/4-20.htm" title="And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down.

(above, Acts ill 4, note). Who is also called Paul. The explanation of Jerome, Augustine, Bede, and many modern commentators, as Meyer, Olshausen, etc., and not rejected by Renan, is that Saul took the name of Paul on the occasion of this remarkable and important conversion of Sergius Paulus. Saul's future intercourse with Gentiles made it desirable that, after the common custom of the Jews of his day - as seen in Peter, Stephen, Mark, Lucius, Jason, Crispus, Justus, Niger, Aquila, Priscilla, Drusilla etc. - he should have a Gentile name, and so, in honor of his illustrious convert, or in memory of his conversion, or at the special request of Sergius Paulus (Baronius), he took the name of Paul, which in sound was not unlike his Hebrew name. The fact of this change of name being recorded by St. Luke at this precise moment makes this the most simple and natural explanation. Compare Gideon's change of name to Jerubbaal (<a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>; <a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="/judges/8-29.htm">Judges 8:29, 35</a>). Alford, on the ether hand, thinks it strange that any one should make such a mistake as Jerome's, and says that "this notice marks the transition from the former part of his history" - "gathered from the narratives of others" - to "the joint memoirs of himself and St. Paul." But this gives no account of the coincidence of the two Pauls, nor is it true that the latter half of the Acts begins here. It began at ver. 1, and the name of Saul has been retained three times in the early part of this chapter. Farrar speaks of this explanation as, long and deservedly abandoned," and as having in it an element of vulgarity. Howson thinks that <span class="accented">Paul</span> had long been his Roman name, but that the conversion of Sergius Paulus, as it were, stereotyped the Roman name as that by which the apostle was henceforth to be known. The idea of Augustine and others, that he took the name of Paul (<span class="accented">paulus</span>, small) from humility, to indicate that he was "the least" of the apostles, is fanciful. Neither is Chrysostom's assertion, that he changed his name at his ordination or consecration, borne out by the facts. Renan ('Saint Paul,' 1:19) notes that "Paul" was a very common name in Cilicia. No certainty can be arrived at in the matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Saulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4569.htm">Strong's 4569: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul, the apostle.
