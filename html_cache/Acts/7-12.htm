The mention of grain in Egypt refers to the severe famine that affected the region, as described in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41-42</a>. Egypt, with its Nile River, was a fertile land and often a source of sustenance during famines. This event is a pivotal moment in the history of Israel, as it sets the stage for the eventual migration of Jacob's family to Egypt. The famine and the subsequent journey to Egypt were part of God's providential plan, as foretold to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, where God told Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own.<p><b>he sent our fathers on their first visit</b><br>The "fathers" refers to the sons of Jacob, the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel. This first visit to Egypt is recorded in <a href="/genesis/42.htm">Genesis 42</a>, where Jacob sends ten of his sons to buy grain, keeping Benjamin, the youngest, at home. This journey marks the beginning of a series of events that would lead to the eventual settlement of the Israelites in Egypt. The visit is significant as it initiates the reconciliation process between Joseph and his brothers, who had previously sold him into slavery. This narrative foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who, like Joseph, was rejected by His own but ultimately became the means of their salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, also known as Israel.

Jacob didn&#8217;t shrug off the crisis; he took it seriously and sought provision.<p>- His response illustrates an alert, responsible faith&#8212;he listened, weighed the report, and acted. <a href="/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16&#8211;17</a> reminds us that God Himself &#8220;called down famine&#8221; yet had already sent Joseph ahead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that there was grain in Egypt</b><p>- Egypt had storehouses because God gave Joseph wisdom to interpret Pharaoh&#8217;s dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-47.htm">Genesis 41:47-57</a>).<p>- What looked like a purely economic solution was actually part of God&#8217;s redemptive plan to preserve the covenant family (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5-7</a>).<p>- The contrast is striking: scarcity in Canaan, plenty in Egypt. God sometimes redirects His people to unexpected places for provision (cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he sent our fathers</b><p>- &#8220;Our fathers&#8221; refers to Jacob&#8217;s sons&#8212;the patriarchs of the twelve tribes&#8212;minus Benjamin on this first journey (<a href="/genesis/42-3.htm">Genesis 42:3-4</a>).<p>- Their going fulfills Jacob&#8217;s duty as head of the family to secure food, but it also sets up God&#8217;s deeper purpose: reunion with Joseph and reconciliation among the brothers (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>- <a href="/acts/7-12.htm">Acts 7:12-13</a> ties Stephen&#8217;s sermon to Israel&#8217;s history, reminding listeners that these revered ancestors once stood in need and were guided by God&#8217;s providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on their first visit</b><p>- This was trip one of two (<a href="/bsb/genesis/42.htm">Genesis 42 and 43</a>). On the first, the brothers did not recognize Joseph; on the second, he revealed himself (<a href="/acts/7-13.htm">Acts 7:13</a>).<p>- God often works in stages: initial obedience opens the door to fuller revelation (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores timing&#8212;God was orchestrating every detail so that, in Joseph&#8217;s words, &#8220;God sent me before you to preserve life&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-12.htm">Acts 7:12</a> shows Jacob responding promptly to famine news, directing his sons to Egypt where God had already positioned Joseph. Each phrase highlights divine providence: Jacob hears, Egypt has grain, the patriarchs are dispatched, and this is only the &#8220;first visit&#8221; in a larger story of rescue and reconciliation. The verse invites confidence that God foresees need, prepares supply, and guides His people step by step toward His saving purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Sent <span class="accented">forth</span> for sent out, A.V.; <span class="accented">the first time</span> for <span class="accented">first</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jacob</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#945;&#954;&#8060;&#946;</span> <span class="translit">(Iak&#333;b)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2384.htm">Strong's 2384: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jacob, the progenitor of the Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
