Peter's message centered on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as those found in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a> and <a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8-11</a>. The term "embraced" indicates a wholehearted acceptance and belief in the gospel, a transformative moment for the listeners. This acceptance is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>, where He said, "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."<p><b>were baptized</b><br>Baptism here is a public declaration of faith and repentance, symbolizing the washing away of sins and the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). This act follows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The practice of baptism has roots in Jewish purification rituals but is given new meaning in the Christian context as an initiation into the community of believers.<p><b>and about three thousand</b><br>The number "three thousand" signifies a significant and rapid growth of the early church, indicating the powerful work of the Holy Spirit. This event is reminiscent of the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, where about three thousand people died due to idolatry (<a href="/exodus/32-28.htm">Exodus 32:28</a>). In contrast, the giving of the Spirit at Pentecost brings life and salvation to about three thousand, highlighting the new covenant's superiority and grace.<p><b>were added to the believers</b><br>This addition to the believers marks the formation of the early Christian community, united in faith and purpose. The term "added" suggests divine action, as it is God who grows the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). This community is characterized by devotion to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>), reflecting the communal and spiritual life intended for the church.<p><b>that day</b><br>The phrase "that day" refers to the day of Pentecost, a Jewish feast occurring fifty days after Passover, celebrating the firstfruits of the wheat harvest and the giving of the Law. This timing is significant as it marks the birth of the church and the firstfruits of the new covenant community.

Not four years had passed since there had been a like eagerness to rush to the baptism of John. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Three thousand souls.</span>--The largeness of the number has been urged as rendering it probable that the baptism was by affusion, not immersion. On the other hand, (1) immersion had clearly been practised by John, and was involved in the original meaning of the word, and it is not likely that the rite should have been curtailed of its full proportions at the very outset. (2) The symbolic meaning of the act required immersion in order that it might be clearly manifested, and <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, and <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>, seem almost of necessity to imply the more complete mode. The swimming-baths of Bethesda and Siloam (see Notes on <a href="/john/5-7.htm" title="The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.">John 5:7</a>; <a href="/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.)

The sequel shows (1) that many converts were made from the Hellenistic Jews who were present at the Feast (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>); and (2) that few, if any, of the converts were of the ruling class (<a href="/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>).
