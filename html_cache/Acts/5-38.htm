His advice is given during a critical moment when the apostles are being persecuted for preaching about Jesus. Gamaliel's counsel reflects a cautious and pragmatic approach, emphasizing discernment and patience. His role as a Pharisee is significant, as Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the law and often opposed the early Christian movement. Gamaliel's wisdom is acknowledged in Jewish tradition, and he is mentioned in <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a> as the teacher of Paul.<p><b>Leave these men alone. Let them go!</b><br>Gamaliel's recommendation to release the apostles without punishment is a strategic move to avoid unnecessary conflict. This reflects a broader principle found in <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, which states that no wisdom, understanding, or counsel can prevail against the Lord. By suggesting that the apostles be left alone, Gamaliel implies that if their mission is not from God, it will naturally come to nothing. This approach also aligns with the Jewish legal principle of not punishing without clear evidence of wrongdoing.<p><b>For if their purpose or endeavor is of human origin,</b><br>Gamaliel distinguishes between human and divine origins, a theme prevalent throughout scripture. Human endeavors, when not aligned with God's will, are often depicted as fleeting and ultimately unsuccessful. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which states that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. The early Christian movement faced skepticism, and Gamaliel's words suggest that time will reveal the true nature of their mission.<p><b>it will fail.</b><br>The assertion that human-originated plans will fail underscores the biblical principle of divine sovereignty. Throughout the Bible, God is portrayed as the ultimate authority whose plans cannot be thwarted (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>). This phrase also serves as a prophetic insight into the enduring nature of the Christian faith, which, despite human opposition, has persisted and grown over centuries. Gamaliel's statement is a reminder of the futility of opposing God's purposes, as seen in the eventual spread of Christianity despite early persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gamaliel.htm">Gamaliel</a></b><br>A respected Pharisee and teacher of the law, who was a member of the Sanhedrin.

Gamaliel&#8217;s counsel, though coming from a cautious Pharisee, affirms a timeless principle: trust God to vindicate His gospel, leave room for His verdict, and stay faithful, knowing that every scheme outside His will is destined to crumble.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Refrain from these men.</span>--The advice implies something like a suppressed conviction not bold enough to utter itself. Gamaliel takes his place in the class, at all times numerous, of waiters upon Providence, who are neutral till a cause is successful, and then come forward with a tardy sympathy, but who, above all, shrink from committing themselves while there seems any possibility of failure. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1Thessalonians 2:13</a>, St. Paul seems almost to contrast the readiness of his disciples in receiving his gospel, not as "of man," but as "of God," with the timid caution of his Master. As a prudential dilemma, the argument was forcible enough. Resistance was either needless or it was hopeless. If needless, it was a waste of energy; if hopeless, it involved a fatal risk besides that of mere failure. We may legitimately think of the fiery disciple as listening impatiently to this temporising counsel, and as stirred by it to greater vehemence.<p><span class= "bld">It will come to nought.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">it will be overthrown, </span>so as to preserve the emphasis of the repetition of the same verb in the next clause of the dilemma.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Be overthrown</span> for come to <span class="accented">nought</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the present [case]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I advise</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
