Festus, the Roman governor, acknowledges his lack of concrete charges against Paul, highlighting the tension between Roman law and Jewish accusations. This situation underscores the fairness of Roman legal procedures, which required clear charges before sending a prisoner to the emperor. It also illustrates the providence of God in protecting Paul, as no legitimate accusation could be made against him.<p><b>Therefore I have brought him before all of you,</b><br>Festus convenes a public hearing, involving local leaders and King Agrippa, to gather more information. This reflects the Roman practice of seeking counsel from others in complex legal matters. The gathering of many witnesses also fulfills the biblical principle of establishing truth through multiple testimonies (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This public setting serves to further validate Paul's innocence and the gospel message he preached.<p><b>and especially before you, King Agrippa,</b><br>King Agrippa II, a Herodian ruler with Jewish heritage, is uniquely positioned to understand the religious nuances of the case. His presence signifies the intersection of Jewish and Roman worlds, as Agrippa had authority over the temple and could provide insight into Jewish customs. This moment also fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would testify before kings (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>).<p><b>so that after this inquiry I may have something to write.</b><br>Festus seeks to clarify the charges against Paul to justify sending him to Caesar. This reflects the Roman administrative requirement for a detailed report accompanying a prisoner sent to the emperor. The inquiry serves God's purpose by providing Paul another opportunity to witness about Christ, fulfilling his mission to spread the gospel to the Gentiles and rulers (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/festus.htm">Festus</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who succeeded Felix.

Tiberius also ('Life of Tiberius,' 27), being once called "lord" (<span class="accented">dominus</span>) by some one, indignantly repudiated the title.
