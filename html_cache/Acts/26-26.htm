His knowledge of Jewish history and prophecy would have made him familiar with the events surrounding Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Agrippa's background provided him with an understanding of the Messianic expectations of the Jews, which Paul was addressing. This phrase highlights the importance of understanding the audience's background when sharing the Gospel.<p><b>and I can speak freely to him</b><br>Paul's ability to speak freely to King Agrippa indicates a level of respect and openness in their dialogue. This freedom suggests that Paul was confident in the truth of his message and the integrity of his testimony. It also reflects the Roman legal system's allowance for a fair hearing, even for those accused of serious charges. Paul's boldness in speaking truth to power is a model for believers to share their faith without fear.<p><b>I am confident that none of this has escaped his notice</b><br>Paul asserts that the events surrounding Jesus' ministry were well-known and public. The miracles, teachings, crucifixion, and reports of the resurrection were not hidden events. This public nature of Jesus' life and the early Christian movement meant that even those in authority, like Agrippa, could not ignore them. This statement underscores the historical reality of Jesus' life and the early church's impact.<p><b>because it was not done in a corner</b><br>The phrase "not done in a corner" emphasizes the transparency and public nature of Jesus' ministry. Unlike secretive cults or hidden movements, Christianity began with events witnessed by many. This openness is a testament to the authenticity of the Gospel message. The public nature of Jesus' works and the spread of the early church fulfill prophecies about the Messiah being a light to the nations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.

Agrippa, linked to Jerusalem politics, could hardly have missed it.<p>&#8226; By stressing Agrippa&#8217;s knowledge, Paul removes any excuse of ignorance and invites the king to evaluate the evidence already at hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because it was not done in a corner</b><p>The climax points to the public, verifiable nature of Christ&#8217;s life, death, and resurrection.<p>&#8226; Jesus testified, &#8220;I have spoken openly to the world&#8230; I said nothing in secret&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; His crucifixion occurred at Passover before multitudes; His empty tomb prompted an official cover-up (<a href="/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11-15</a>), ironically confirming that something spectacular happened.<p>&#8226; Post-resurrection appearances were public: &#8220;He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Acts repeatedly emphasizes eyewitness veracity (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; 2:32), grounding faith in historical reality rather than private vision or secret teaching.<p>&#8226; The phrase challenges every listener: since the facts are public, the proper response is not dismissal but decision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words to Agrippa highlight four truths: the king&#8217;s informed background, Paul&#8217;s Spirit-given boldness, the unavoidable publicity of Christ&#8217;s works, and the open, testable nature of the gospel events. Because none of it &#8220;was done in a corner,&#8221; every hearer&#8212;then and now&#8212;is urged to weigh the evidence and embrace the risen Lord whose story stands in plain sight of history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">I am persuaded that</span> <span class= "bld">none of these things are hidden from him.</span>--The appeal to Agrippa's knowledge is two-fold. He knew that Moses and the prophets had spoken of the great Prophet and Deliverer whom the Jews knew as the Christ. He knew also that for more than a quarter of a century there had been communities of Jews in Judaea and Galilee and Samaria (see Note on <a href="/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>) resting on the belief that the Christ had come, and that He had suffered and risen from the dead.
