It highlights the importance of faith and focus, removing doubt and distraction. The act of sending others out can also signify the sacredness of the moment, reserved for those directly involved in the miracle.<p><b>He knelt down and prayed,</b><br>Kneeling is a posture of humility and submission, often associated with earnest prayer (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>).

It signifies the moment of divine intervention, where death is conquered, pointing to the power of the resurrection.<p><b>and seeing Peter, she sat up.</b><br>Her immediate response upon seeing Peter indicates recognition and acceptance of the miracle. Sitting up is a sign of restored life and strength, paralleling the resurrection of Jesus, who is the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).
