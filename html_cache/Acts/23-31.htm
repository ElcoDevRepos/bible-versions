In the context of Acts, this obedience underscores the seriousness of the situation involving Paul, a Roman citizen, and the potential for unrest. The Roman military's role in maintaining order in the provinces is well-documented, and their actions here are consistent with historical accounts of Roman governance.<p><b>and brought Paul by night</b><br>Traveling by night was a strategic decision to avoid potential ambushes or public disturbances. This reflects the tension and danger surrounding Paul's situation, as there were plots against his life (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-15</a>). Night travel also indicates the urgency and importance of safely transporting Paul, highlighting the Roman authorities' commitment to justice and protection of a Roman citizen.<p><b>to Antipatris</b><br>Antipatris was a city built by Herod the Great, named in honor of his father, Antipater. Located about 35 miles from Jerusalem, it served as a strategic military post and a stopping point on the way to Caesarea. The choice of Antipatris as a waypoint underscores its significance as a secure location for Roman operations. This journey from Jerusalem to Antipatris marks the first leg of Paul's transfer to Caesarea, where he would stand trial before the Roman governor.

It was about forty-two miles from Jerusalem and twenty-six from Caesarea. Traces of a Roman road have been discovered between it and Jerusalem, more direct by some miles than the better known route through the pass of Beth-horon. Having started probably at or about midnight, they would reach this town about six or seven A.M. They would then be practically beyond all danger of pursuit or attack, and the foot-soldiers therefore returned, as no longer needed, to their barracks in the Tower Antonia, leaving the horsemen to go on with him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - So for then, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Antipatris</span>; "forty-two Roman miles from Jerusalem, and twenty-six from Caesarea, built (on the site of Kaphor Saba) by Herod the Great, and named in honor of Antipater, his father" (Alford). According to Howson, following the American traveller, the Rev. Eli Smith, the route lay from Jerusalem to Gophna, on the road to Nablous, and from Gophna, leaving the great north road by a Roman road of which many distinct traces remain, to Antipatris, avoiding Lydda or Diospolis altogether. Gophna is three hours from Jerusalem, and, as they started at 9 p.m., would be reached by midnight. Five or six hours more would bring them to Antipatris, most of the way being downhill from the hill country of Ephraim to the plain of Sharon. Attera halt of two or three hours, a march of six hours would bring them to Caesarea, which they may have reached in the afternoon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
