In the early church, Jewish Christians continued to observe the Sabbath, and Paul often used it as an opportunity to engage with Jewish communities (<a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14, 17</a>:2).<p><b>we went outside the city gate</b><br>Philippi, a Roman colony, had a limited Jewish presence, as evidenced by the absence of a synagogue. The city gate was a common place for gatherings and trade, and going outside the gate suggests seeking a quieter, more natural setting for prayer and worship, away from the bustling city life.<p><b>along the river</b><br>Rivers were significant in Jewish purification rituals (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a>) and were often chosen for prayer gatherings when synagogues were unavailable. The riverbank provided a serene environment conducive to worship and reflection, reminiscent of the Israelites' experiences by the waters of Babylon (<a href="/psalms/137.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>).<p><b>where it was customary to find a place of prayer</b><br>The Greek term "proseuche" indicates a place designated for prayer, often used by Jewish communities in the Diaspora when a synagogue was not present. This reflects the adaptability of Jewish worship practices in foreign lands, maintaining their faith and traditions despite geographical and cultural challenges.<p><b>After sitting down</b><br>Sitting was a traditional posture for teaching in Jewish culture, as seen in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>). This indicates a readiness to engage in dialogue and instruction, following the example of rabbinic teaching methods.<p><b>we spoke to the women who had gathered there</b><br>The presence of women highlights their active role in early Christian communities. Lydia, mentioned later in the chapter, becomes a significant convert and supporter of Paul's mission (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>).

Where they had no synagogue, and in a military station like Philippi there was not likely to be one, the Jews frequented the river-banks, which made ablutions easy, and often succeeded in getting a piece of ground assigned for that purpose outside the walls of the city. Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 11-13) notes this as one of the instances of the decay of the old faith of Rome:<p>"The groves and streams which once were sacred ground<p>Are now let out td Jews."<p>The local meaning is seen in another line from the same writer (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> iii. 296):<p>"Ede, ubi consistas, in qua te quaero, proseucha?"<p>["Say where thou dwell'st, and in what place of prayer<p>I am to seek thee?"]<p>The oratories, or <span class= "ital">proseuchae, </span>thus formed, were commonly circular, and without a roof. The practice continued in the time of Tertullian, who speaks of the "orationes litorales" of the Jews (<span class= "ital">ad Nat.</span> i. 13). The river, in this instance, was the Gangites. Finding no synagogue in the city, and hearing of the oratory, the company of preachers went out to it to take their part in the Sabbath services, and to preach Christ to any Jews they might find there. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Sabbath day</span> for <span class="accented">sabbath</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">we went forth without the gate</span> for <span class="accented">we went out of the city</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The neighborhood of water, either near a stream or on the seashore, was usually preferred by the Jews as a place for prayer, as affording facility for ablutions (see Josephus, 'Ant.
