Festus, the Roman governor, sought Agrippa's insight due to his familiarity with Jewish matters. This interaction highlights the political and judicial complexities of the Roman Empire, where local rulers like Agrippa played a role in governance alongside Roman officials.<p><b>&#8220;This man could have been released</b><br>Paul's innocence is acknowledged by Agrippa, indicating that the charges against him were not substantial enough to warrant imprisonment. This reflects the recurring theme in Acts of the apostles facing unjust persecution. It also underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and the established religious and political authorities.<p><b>if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#8221;</b><br>Paul's appeal to Caesar was a legal right as a Roman citizen, allowing him to seek a trial in Rome. This decision was strategic, as it provided Paul with the opportunity to witness about Christ in the heart of the Roman Empire. The appeal also fulfilled God's plan for Paul to testify in Rome, as previously revealed in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>.

Earthly decisions by human rulers serve the sovereign purpose of the Lord, who directs every step for the advance of His unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">This man might have been set at liberty . . .</span>--The decision to which Agrippa came showed the wisdom of the line which St. Paul had taken. The matter could not be hushed up nor got rid of. The authorities could not now free themselves from responsibility for the safe custody of the prisoner, and, by releasing him, expose his life to the conspiracies of the Jews; and thus the Apostle at last gained that safe journey to the imperial city which had for many years been the great desire of his heart.<p>It is not without interest to note the subsequent relations between Festus and Agrippa, during the short government of the former, as showing a continuance of the same <span class= "ital">entente cordiale</span> as that which we have seen in this chapter. Agrippa took up his abode at Jerusalem in the old palace of the Asmonean, or Maccabean, princes. It commanded a view of the city, and, from a banquet-hall which he had erected, he could look down upon the courts of the Temple and see the priests sacrificing even as he sat at meat. The Jews looked on this as a profanation, and built a wall which blocked up the view both from the king's palace and from the portico where the Roman soldiers used to stand on guard during the festivals. This was regarded by Festus as an insult, and he ordered the wall to be pulled down. The people of Jerusalem, however, obtained leave to send an embassy to Rome. They secured the support of Poppaea, already half a proselyte, after the fashion of the time among the women of the higher class at Rome, and, by the strange irony of history, the Temple of Jehovah was rescued from profanation by the concubine of Nero (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 8, ? 11). Agrippa continued to display the taste for building which was the hereditary characteristic of his house. Caesarea Philippi was enlarged and named Neronias, in honour of the emperor. A vast theatre was erected at Berytus (<span class= "ital">Beyrout</span>) and adorned with statues. The Temple was at last finished, and the 18,000 workmen who were thus thrown out of work were employed in repaving the city with marble. The stateliness of the Temple ritual was enhanced by the permission which the king gave to the Levites of the choir, in spite of the remonstrance of the priests, that they should wear a linen ephod. Once again we note the irony of history. The king who thus had the glory of completing what the founder of his dynasty had begun, bringing both structure and ritual to a perfection never before attained, saw, within ten years, the capture of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 8, ? 7).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- And Agrippa said</span> for <span class="accented">then said Agrippa</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Agrippa said unto Festus</span>. Festus had consulted Agrippa, as one conversant with Jewish questions, about the case of Paul (<a href="/acts/25-14.htm">Acts 25:14-21</a>). And in the place of hearing he had publicly stated that he had brought him before King Agrippa to be examined, that, "after examination had," he might know what to write to the emperor. Accordingly Agrippa now gives it as his opinion that the prisoner might have been discharged if he had not appealed to Caesar. Festus was of the same opinion, and doubtless wrote to Nero to that effect. The result was that he was acquitted before the emperor's tribunal at Rome, at the end of two years. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/26-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Agrippa</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#947;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#960;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Agrippas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_67.htm">Strong's 67: </a> </span><span class="str2">Agrippa, i.e. Herod Agrippa II.
