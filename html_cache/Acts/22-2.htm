This choice of language by Paul is significant as it establishes a connection with his audience, showing respect and understanding of their cultural and religious identity. Speaking in their native tongue would have immediately captured their attention and demonstrated Paul's deep roots in Jewish tradition. This moment reflects Paul's strategic approach to ministry, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>, where he adapts to his audience to win them over for Christ.<p><b>they became even more silent</b><br>The crowd's increased silence indicates their heightened interest and respect for what Paul was about to say. This reaction underscores the power of language and cultural identity in communication. The silence also sets the stage for the gravity of Paul's testimony, as he prepares to share his dramatic conversion experience. This moment of silence can be seen as a divine pause, allowing the Holy Spirit to prepare the hearts of the listeners for the message of the Gospel.<p><b>Then Paul declared</b><br>Paul's declaration marks the beginning of his defense and testimony before the Jewish crowd. This is a pivotal moment in the narrative of Acts, as Paul recounts his personal encounter with Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus. His testimony serves as a powerful witness to the transformative power of Christ, fulfilling the role of a witness as described in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. Paul's boldness in declaring his faith, despite the potential for persecution, exemplifies the courage and conviction that comes from a life changed by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>A former persecutor of Christians who became a devoted apostle of Jesus Christ.

It was strikingly in harmony with his addressing them as "brethren" that he should speak to them in their own mother tongue. There is a living reality in such touches which seems at once to refute Renan's suspicion that St. Luke invented this and other of St. Paul's speeches in the later chapters of the Acts. The full report of these later speeches is abundantly accounted for by the fact that through this time St. Luke was with St. Paul, and heard the speeches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/22-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
