James emphasizes that God's plan for the Gentiles was not a new concept but one that had been revealed long ago.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* The early church was grappling with the integration of Gentile believers. Jewish Christians were accustomed to the Mosaic Law, and the inclusion of Gentiles without requiring adherence to these laws was a significant shift. James' statement reassures Jewish believers that this inclusion aligns with God's longstanding plan.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* This phrase echoes the prophetic writings, such as <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a>, which James quotes earlier in the chapter. These prophecies foretold the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, indicating that this was always part of God's purpose.<br><br>*Prophecy:* The phrase underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Gentiles. It highlights the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament, affirming that the inclusion of the Gentiles was anticipated by the prophets.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* Jesus' ministry often reached out to Gentiles, foreshadowing the broader mission of the church. His interactions with non-Jews, such as the Samaritan woman and the Roman centurion, prefigure the church's mission to all nations, aligning with the divine plan known for ages.<br><br>*Archaeological Insights:* While there are no direct archaeological findings related to this specific phrase, the broader context of the Jerusalem Council is supported by historical records of early church councils and synagogues, which were centers of Jewish and early Christian life.<br><br>*Geographical Insights:* The Jerusalem Council took place in Jerusalem, the heart of Jewish religious life. This location underscores the significance of the decision, as it was made in the city central to Jewish identity and faith, yet it affirmed the global scope of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The leader of the Jerusalem church who speaks during the council, providing wisdom and guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A significant meeting of early church leaders to discuss the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish individuals who have come to faith in Jesus Christ, central to the discussion in <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>An apostle who shares his experience of God&#8217;s work among the Gentiles, supporting their inclusion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Missionaries who report on the signs and wonders God has done among the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_foreknowledge.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty and Foreknowledge</a></b><br>God&#8217;s plans are eternal and unchanging.

The words are an implicit answer to the charge of innovation. If the work were of God, it could not be so called, for His mercies are everlasting, and the work which He carries on now must be thought of as contemplated and purposed from eternity. The principle has clearly a wider range than that within which St. James applies it. We do well to remember, whenever we are tempted to offer an obstinate resistance to what seems to us a novelty, and which we therefore are ready to condemn, that we ought first to inquire whether the "signs of the times" do not indicate that it is part of the divine plan, working through the ages, that the old order should change and give place to the new.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Who <span class="accented">maketh these things known</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">who doeth all these things</span> (in ver. 17 of A.V.); <span class="accented">known</span> for <span class="accented">known unto God are all his works</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Known from the beginning of the world</span>.

But the LXX. ver. 17 differs widely from the present Hebrew text. For whereas the Hebrew has, "That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen that are called by my Name," the LXX.

There is every appearance of the LXX., followed here by St. James, having preserved the true reading. As regards the reading of the R.V. in ver. 18, it is a manifest corruption. It is not the reading of either the Hebrew or the Greek version of Amos, or of any other version; and it makes no sense. Whereas the T.R., which is the reading of Irenaeus (3:12.), as Meyer truly says, "presents a thought completely clear, pious, noble, and inoffensive as regards the connection," though he thinks that a reason for rejecting it. Nothing could be more germane to St. James's argument than thus to show from the words of Amos that God's present purpose of taking the Gentiles to be his people was, like all his other works, formed from the beginning of the world (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, etc.). As regards the interpretation of the prophecy of Amos intended, the idea seems to be that that apparent ruin of the house and family of David which culminated in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus would be followed by those "sure mercies of David," which consisted in his resurrection from the dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God, and the gathering in of the Gentiles to his kingdom. The phrase, "the tabernacle of David," is rather difficult, because the word in the Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, tabernacle or booth of David. It is the word used for the booths at the Feast of Tabernacles, and denotes a temporary shed of branches or the like of a very humble character. It is difficult to say why this word was used, unless it was to show that the house of David had fallen to a low estate before it was pulled down. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[that] have been known</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(gn&#333;sta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1110.htm">Strong's 1110: </a> </span><span class="str2">Known, an acquaintance.
