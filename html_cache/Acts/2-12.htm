This occurred during the Feast of Pentecost, a significant Jewish festival, which drew Jews from various regions to Jerusalem. The sudden ability of the apostles to speak in different languages was a miraculous sign, fulfilling Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit's power (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The terms "astounded" and "perplexed" indicate a mix of amazement and confusion, highlighting the supernatural aspect of the event. This reaction is reminiscent of other biblical instances where divine intervention left people in awe, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>).<p><b>they asked one another</b><br>The phrase "they asked one another" suggests a communal effort to understand the phenomenon. This reflects the Jewish tradition of discussing and interpreting events collectively, often seen in synagogues and among the Pharisees. The communal nature of their inquiry underscores the importance of community in seeking understanding and truth, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p><b>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</b><br>The question "What does this mean?" indicates a search for understanding and purpose behind the miraculous event. This question is central to the narrative, as it sets the stage for Peter's subsequent sermon, where he explains the fulfillment of prophecy from <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a> and the significance of Jesus' resurrection and ascension. The inquiry reflects a deeper spiritual hunger and openness to divine revelation, echoing the prophetic tradition where signs and wonders often required interpretation (<a href="/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25-28</a>). This moment also prefigures the spread of the Gospel, as the understanding of God's work through Christ would soon extend beyond the Jewish community to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in <a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, filled with the Holy Spirit, speaking in various tongues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Composed of Jews from every nation under heaven, gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events of Pentecost take place, a central location for Jewish worship and pilgrimage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pentecost.htm">Pentecost</a></b><br>A Jewish feast occurring fifty days after Passover, marking the giving of the Law at Sinai and now the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, whose arrival fulfills Jesus' promise and empowers the apostles for ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Power of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to witness and fulfill God's mission.

Such visible, audible signs of God&#8217;s direct activity leave people thunderstruck. Luke often records this reaction to Jesus&#8217; and the apostles&#8217; works (<a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>; 7:16; <a href="/acts/3-10.htm">Acts 3:10</a>). Scripture never treats awe as mere emotion; it is the right response when the living God invades human space.<p>&#8226; These signs authenticated that the promised Holy Spirit had truly come (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Moses&#8217; glowing face (<a href="/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>) or Elijah&#8217;s fire-from-heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38&#8211;39</a>), the miracle pointed to divine authority that demands attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and perplexed</b><p>Astonishment alone can fade, but here it is joined with bewilderment. The listeners cannot fit what they see into their previous categories. Throughout Scripture, confusion often precedes revelation: Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians in <a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>, Nebuchadnezzar before Daniel&#8217;s interpretation in <a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1&#8211;3</a>, or Herod when he heard rumors of Jesus&#8217; resurrection in <a href="/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14&#8211;16</a>.<p>&#8226; Perplexity underscores that human understanding is limited until God explains His work (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; It readies the heart to receive truth, as Paul later notes: &#8220;God is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>), meaning He supplies clarity where confusion reigns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked one another</b><p>Instead of dismissing what they saw, the crowd engaged each other. Spiritual awakening often begins with honest conversation (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The shared questioning shows that faith is both personal and communal.<p>&#8226; It sets the stage for Peter&#8217;s sermon, proving God uses ordinary dialogue to open doors for the gospel (<a href="/acts/17-17.htm">Acts 17:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Their mutual inquiry reflects <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>: &#8220;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</b><p>This is the heart-cry of people standing on the edge of revelation. Peter immediately answers by pointing to <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28&#8211;32</a>, declaring that God&#8217;s last-days promise is now fulfilled (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The question invites explanation, and Scripture supplies it. The Spirit&#8217;s outpouring signals the dawn of a new covenant reality (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The miraculous languages demonstrate the gospel&#8217;s reach to &#8220;every nation under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>), fulfilling <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> and anticipating <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<p>&#8226; Their inquiry is the doorway to salvation: &#8220;When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>). Wonder turns to repentance, then to faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/2-12.htm">Acts 2:12</a> shows genuine seekers caught between awe and confusion, driven to ask the right question. God orchestrates signs that stun, perplex, and spark conversation so that His Word can supply the meaning. The verse teaches that amazement without understanding is incomplete, but when the Spirit moves and Scripture speaks, bewilderment becomes belief and the crowd becomes the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They were all amazed, and were in doubt.</span>--The last word is somewhat stronger in the Greek: "were much perplexed," as in <a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>.
