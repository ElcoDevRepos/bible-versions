Ephesus was a major center for magical arts in the ancient world, known for its Ephesian letters&#8212;amulets and charms believed to hold magical power. The practice of magic was common in Greco-Roman culture, often intertwined with religion and daily life. The conversion of these individuals signifies a significant spiritual shift, as they turned away from their former ways to embrace the teachings of Christianity.<p><b>brought their books</b><br>The books mentioned here were likely scrolls or codices containing spells, incantations, and instructions for performing magical rituals. These texts were valuable both monetarily and culturally, as they represented the practitioners' livelihood and belief system. The act of bringing these books indicates a public renunciation of their past practices and a commitment to their new faith.<p><b>and burned them in front of everyone</b><br>Burning the books publicly was a powerful demonstration of repentance and a break from their past. In the ancient world, fire was often used to purify and destroy, symbolizing a complete and irreversible rejection of the old life. This act also served as a public testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel, encouraging others to consider the truth of the Christian message.<p><b>When the value of the books was calculated</b><br>The calculation of the books' value underscores the significant financial sacrifice made by these new believers. It highlights the sincerity of their conversion, as they were willing to give up substantial wealth for the sake of their newfound faith. This act of sacrifice is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>, where the kingdom of heaven is likened to a treasure worth giving up everything to obtain.<p><b>the total came to fifty thousand drachmas</b><br>A drachma was a silver coin equivalent to a day's wage for a laborer. Therefore, fifty thousand drachmas represented an enormous sum, indicating the extensive nature of the magical practices in Ephesus and the considerable impact of the Gospel in the region. This event demonstrates the power of the Holy Spirit to bring about radical change in individuals and communities, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where nations turn to the Lord and abandon their former ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a hub of commerce and culture.

These arts were almost, so to speak, the <span class= "ital">specialite</span> of Ephesus. Magicians and astrologers swarmed in her streets (comp. the reference to them as analogous to the magicians at the court of Pharaoh in <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2Timothy 3:8</a>), and there was a brisk trade in the charms, incantations, books of divination, rules for interpreting dreams, and the like, such as have at all times made up the structure of superstition. The so-called "Ephesian spells" (<span class= "ital">grammata Ephesia</span>) were small slips of parchment in silk bags, on which were written strange cabalistical words, of little or of lost meaning. The words themselves are given by Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom.</span> v., c. 46), and he interprets them, though they are so obscure as to baffle the conjectures of philology, as meaning Darkness and Light, the Earth and the Year, the Sun and Truth. They were probably a survival of the old Phrygian <span class= "ital">cultus</span> of the powers of Nature which had existed prior to the introduction of the Greek name of Artemis.<p><span class= "bld">And burned them before all men.</span>--This, then, was the result of the two sets of facts recorded in <a href="/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>; <a href="/acts/19-16.htm" title="And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.">Acts 19:16</a>. The deep-ingrained superstition of the people was treated, as it were, hom?opathically. Charms and names were allowed to be channels of renovation, but were shown to be so by no virtue of their own, but only as being <span class= "ital">media</span> between the Divine power on the one hand and the faith of the receiver on the other; and so the disease was cured. The student of the history of Florence cannot help recalling the analogous scene in that city, when men and women, artists and musicians, brought the things in which they most delighted--pictures, ornaments, costly dresses--and burnt them in the Piazza of St. Mark at the bidding of Savonarola. The tense of the verb implies that the "burning" was continuous, but leaves it uncertain whether it was an oft-repeated act or one that lasted for some hours. In this complete renunciation of the old evil past we may probably see the secret of the capacity for a higher knowledge which St. Paul recognises as belonging to Ephesus more than to most other churches. (See Note on <a href="/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span>--The coin referred to was the Attic <span class= "ital">drachma, </span>usually estimated at about 8&#171;d. of English money, and the total amount answers, accordingly, to 1, 770 17s. 6d., as the equivalent in coin. In its purchasing power, as determined by the prevalent rate of wages (a <span class= "ital">denarius</span> or <span class= "ital">drachma</span> for a day's work), it was probably equivalent to a much larger sum. Such books fetched what might be called "fancy" prices, according to their supposed rareness, or the secrets to which they professed to introduce. Often, it may be, a book was sold as absolutely unique.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- And not a few</span> for <span class="accented">many</span>... <span class="accented">also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> practice<span class="accented">d</span> for <span class="accented">which used</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">in the sight of all</span> for <span class="accented">before all men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That practiced curious arts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> applied to persons means "a busybody" (<a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>), one who does what it is not his business to do, and pries into matters with which he has no concern (comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a>); applied to things, it means that which it is not anybody's business to attend to, that which is vain and superfluous; and then, by a further extension of meaning, that which is forbidden, and specially magic arts and occult sciences. <span class="cmt_word">Fifty thousand pieces of silver</span>. There is a difference of opinion as to what coin or weight is meant. If Greek coinage, which is perhaps natural in a Greek city, fifty thousand drachmae of silver would be meant, equal to &pound;1875, If Jewish shekels are meant, the sum would amount to &pound;7000 ('Speaker's Commentary'). It is in favor of drachmae being meant that, with the exception of <a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a> and <a href="/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>, the LXX. always express the word "shekel" or "didrachm" after the numeral and before the word "silver."
