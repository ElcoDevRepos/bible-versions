His conversion to Christianity is significant because it demonstrates the early church's outreach to Jewish leaders and the impact of the Gospel message. This event is a testament to the power of the Gospel to reach even those deeply rooted in Jewish tradition. The synagogue was a central place for teaching and community life, making Crispus's conversion a notable event in the spread of Christianity.<p><b>and his whole household believed in the Lord.</b><br>The conversion of Crispus's entire household reflects a common pattern in the New Testament, where the faith of a household leader often led to the conversion of the entire family. This mirrors other instances, such as the conversion of the Philippian jailer in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>. The household's belief signifies the communal nature of faith in the early church and highlights the influence of the head of the household in spiritual matters.<p><b>And many of the Corinthians who heard the message</b><br>Corinth was a major city in ancient Greece, known for its diversity and immorality, as well as its strategic location for trade. The city's population was a mix of Greeks, Romans, and Jews, making it a fertile ground for the spread of the Gospel. The message that Paul preached was the good news of Jesus Christ, which resonated with many Corinthians despite the city's reputation for moral laxity. This phrase underscores the universal appeal of the Gospel across different cultures and social backgrounds.<p><b>believed and were baptized.</b><br>Baptism was an outward expression of an inward faith and a public declaration of one's commitment to Christ. It was a significant step for new believers, symbolizing their identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. The act of baptism in Corinth indicates the establishment of a Christian community within a predominantly pagan society. This practice aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize new believers. The sequence of belief followed by baptism highlights the early church's emphasis on faith as the prerequisite for baptism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/crispus.htm">Crispus</a></b><br>He was the leader of the synagogue in Corinth.

This is the first time Crispus appears, yet Paul later recalls, &#8220;I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a>). His name resurfaces in that grateful memory because his conversion became a landmark moment, proving that the gospel could penetrate even the most established religious circles. Earlier in Corinth Paul had faced resistance (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>), but Crispus shows how the Lord &#8220;opens hearts&#8221; just as He did for Lydia in Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The synagogue leader</b><p>A synagogue ruler supervised services, safeguarded scrolls, and guided teaching. When someone in that position turns to Christ, it signals a dramatic shift:<p>&#8226; The community&#8217;s spiritual gatekeeper now follows the very Messiah many there questioned (cf. <a href="/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41</a>; <a href="/acts/13-15.htm">Acts 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; His leadership lends credibility to Paul&#8217;s message, much like Jairus&#8217;s faith encouraged those watching Jesus heal his daughter (<a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>Paul had just moved next door to the synagogue into Titius Justus&#8217;s house (<a href="/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>); from that vantage point he kept speaking &#8220;persistently&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4-5</a>). Crispus&#8217;s response shows how the Lord rewarded that perseverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his whole household believed in the Lord</b><p>The phrase does not suggest automatic salvation but rather that every family member likewise placed faith in Jesus. This echoes:<p>&#8226; Cornelius&#8217;s kin and friends gathered to hear Peter (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24, 44</a>).<p>&#8226; Lydia&#8217;s household following her decision (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The Philippian jailer who, after believing, had &#8220;all his household&#8221; baptized (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>).<p>When Scripture records household belief, each person hears, understands, and responds. Still, the example reminds us of the ripple effect of one parent&#8217;s or leader&#8217;s faith (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And many of the Corinthians who heard the message</b><p>Corinth was a bustling port city filled with philosophies, yet &#8220;faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). Luke stresses the simple sequence:<p>&#8226; They heard Paul&#8217;s preaching&#8212;&#8220;I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; They recognized the message as God&#8217;s word, &#8220;which performs its work in you who believe&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>Paul&#8217;s ministry model&#8212;reasoning, explaining, proving (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>)&#8212;bore fruit again here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Believed and were baptized</b><p>Throughout Acts the outward sign of baptism immediately follows genuine faith:<p>&#8226; 3,000 at Pentecost &#8220;accepted his message&#8221; and &#8220;were baptized&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>).<p>&#8226; The Samaritans &#8220;believed Philip &#8230; and were baptized&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Cornelius&#8217;s household, already filled with the Spirit, was commanded to be baptized (<a href="/acts/10-47.htm">Acts 10:47-48</a>).<p>In Corinth the same pattern holds. Baptism does not save, yet it publicly declares union with Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). By submitting to baptism right away, these new believers broke with their former identities&#8212;religious, cultural, or immoral&#8212;and embraced a new life in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a> illustrates the gospel&#8217;s power to reach every layer of society: a respected synagogue ruler, his entire family, and a crowd of ordinary Corinthians. Each heard, believed, and confirmed that belief through baptism. The verse underlines three timeless truths: persistent gospel witness bears fruit, individual faith can transform whole households, and public baptism boldly marks the start of a new allegiance to Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord.</span>--The article does not necessarily show that there was only one ruler--commonly, as at the Pisidian Antioch (<a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>), there were more--but that this Crispus was thus distinguished from others of the same name.
