In the context of <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, Paul had been speaking to the believers in Troas, and a young man named Eutychus fell from a window and was presumed dead. The relief felt by the people underscores the communal nature of early Christian gatherings, where the well-being of each member was of significant concern. This relief also reflects the power of God working through Paul, affirming his apostolic authority and the truth of the Gospel message. The emotional response can be compared to other biblical instances where communities experienced relief after witnessing God's intervention, such as the Israelites' relief after crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>to take the boy home alive.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the miraculous nature of Eutychus being brought back to life. In the cultural and historical context, life and death were often seen as being in the hands of divine powers. The fact that Eutychus was taken home alive serves as a testament to the life-giving power of God, working through His apostles. This event parallels other biblical resurrections, such as Jesus raising Jairus's daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>) and Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>), showcasing a type of Christ's own resurrection power. The act of taking the boy home alive also symbolizes restoration and the continuation of life, reinforcing the hope and promise of eternal life found in the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who was preaching in Troas.
