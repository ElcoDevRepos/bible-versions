The Law was given to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, as described in <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19-20</a>. It was a significant covenant between God and His chosen people, setting them apart from other nations. The Law included moral, ceremonial, and civil regulations that were meant to guide the Israelites in their relationship with God and with each other.<p><b>ordained by angels</b><br>The involvement of angels in the giving of the Law is mentioned in several places in Scripture, such as <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a> and <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>. This suggests that angels played a role as mediators in the transmission of the Law from God to Moses. The presence of angels underscores the divine authority and sacredness of the Law, highlighting its importance in the Jewish faith.<p><b>yet have not kept it.</b><br>This phrase is a direct accusation against the Jewish leaders for their failure to adhere to the very Law they received. Despite their knowledge and outward observance, they often missed the Law's deeper spiritual and moral requirements. This critique echoes the words of the prophets, who frequently called out Israel for their disobedience (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21-26</a>). It also aligns with Jesus' own rebukes of the Pharisees and scribes for their hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-28</a>).

The phrase expressed the current Jewish belief that angels were the intermediate agents through whom Israel received the Law; that it was their voice that was heard on Sinai. Here also St. Paul, in speaking of the Law as "ordained by angels" (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>), reproduced St. Stephen.

So here they received the Law "at" or "on the occasion of," the "ordering" or "appointing" of angels. When the angels, who were commissioned by God and spoke in his Name, gave the Law, the Israelites so received it. The A.V., "by the disposition of angels" very nearly ex- presses the true sense. Another sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> - "in view of" - comes to nearly the same thing. St. Paul speaks of the part taken by the angels in the giving of the Law, and in language strikingly resembling the text. He says of it, that it was "ordained through ['by,' A V] angels" God ordained or appointed the Law, but the angels were the instruments or ministers of its promulgation. And it is also distinctly referred to in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where the LXX. read, "On his right hand the angels were with him." In the foregoing verses the application which Stephen had all through been contemplating is hurled with accumulated force at the consciences of his hearers, and cuts them to the heart, but does not bring them to repentance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[you] who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">have received</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(elabete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
