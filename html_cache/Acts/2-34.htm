In the context of <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, Peter is addressing the crowd at Pentecost, clarifying that David's prophetic words in the Psalms were not about himself but about the Messiah. This distinction is crucial because it underscores the belief in Jesus' unique resurrection and ascension, setting Him apart from all other figures in Jewish history. Theologically, this points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in the New Testament, affirming Jesus' divine nature and His role as the promised Messiah.<p><b>but he himself says:</b><br>Here, Peter is quoting David to support his argument. This phrase indicates that David, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, spoke words that were prophetic and not merely personal reflections. It highlights the belief in the divine inspiration of Scripture, where human authors were guided by God to convey truths that often extended beyond their immediate understanding or experience. This also reflects the Jewish tradition of interpreting the Psalms as containing messianic prophecies.<p><b>&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</b><br>This is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, a psalm attributed to David. In this context, "The Lord" refers to Yahweh, the covenant name of God, while "my Lord" refers to the Messiah. This verse is significant because it shows a conversation between God and the Messiah, indicating the Messiah's divine authority and pre-existence. The use of "my Lord" by David suggests a recognition of the Messiah's superiority, which is a key point in Peter's argument that Jesus is the Messiah. This verse is frequently cited in the New Testament to affirm Jesus' divine status and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<p><b>&#8220;Sit at My right hand</b><br>Sitting at the right hand of God is a position of honor, authority, and power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was considered a place of favor and strength. This imagery conveys the exaltation of the Messiah, who is given authority over all creation. In the New Testament, this is understood as Jesus' ascension and His current reign in heaven. It signifies the completion of His redemptive work and His ongoing intercession for believers. This phrase also connects to other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>, which describe Jesus' exalted position and His role as King and High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The revered king of Israel, known for his psalms and his heart for God.
