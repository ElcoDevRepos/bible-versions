Cutting away the anchors signifies a desperate measure taken by the crew to lighten the ship and allow it to move more freely. Anchors in ancient times were crucial for stability, especially during storms, but in this scenario, they were hindering progress. This act symbolizes a point of no return, where the crew had to trust in divine providence rather than their own means of security. Theologically, it can be seen as a metaphor for faith, where believers must sometimes let go of earthly securities to follow God's guidance.<p><b>they left them in the sea</b><br>The decision to leave the anchors in the sea reflects the urgency and critical nature of the situation. In a broader biblical context, the sea often represents chaos and uncertainty (as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). By leaving the anchors behind, the crew was abandoning their last hold on stability, which can be paralleled with the Christian call to leave behind worldly attachments for the sake of spiritual progress.<p><b>as they loosened the ropes that held the rudders</b><br>In ancient ships, rudders were essential for steering and required ropes to control them. Loosening these ropes was necessary to regain control of the ship's direction. This action indicates a shift from a defensive to an offensive strategy, aiming to navigate rather than merely survive. Spiritually, it can be seen as a call to actively engage with one's faith journey, steering towards God's purpose rather than passively enduring life's storms.<p><b>Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind</b><br>Hoisting the foresail was a strategic move to harness the wind's power and propel the ship forward. The foresail, a smaller sail at the front of the ship, was crucial for maneuverability. This act represents taking advantage of the opportunities provided by God, using the resources and circumstances He provides to move towards His intended destination. It echoes the biblical theme of divine guidance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trust in the Lord leads to directed paths.<p><b>and made for the beach</b><br>The beach represents safety and deliverance from the storm. In the narrative, it was the crew's goal to reach land and escape the perilous sea. This can be seen as a type of salvation, where reaching the shore symbolizes the ultimate deliverance God provides. It parallels the Christian hope of reaching the 'promised land' or eternal life, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>. The beach, in this context, is a place of refuge and fulfillment of God's promise of safety amidst trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

Physically, the anchors were essential for stability, yet in the storm they now threaten survival.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, there are moments when God calls us to release familiar securities and trust His leading, as seen when Abram left Haran (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) or when Peter stepped out of the boat (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul had already assured everyone on board that God would spare their lives (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-25</a>). Cutting the anchors demonstrates faith in that promise&#8212;choosing obedience over conventional wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They left them in the sea</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they left them in the sea&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Once released, the anchors sink beyond recovery. There is no going back. Likewise, Elisha burned his plows after receiving Elijah&#8217;s call (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>); the disciples left their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Letting go frees the ship&#8212;and us&#8212;from dead weight that prevents forward movement (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Loosened the ropes that held the rudders</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;as they loosened the ropes that held the rudders.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In the gale, the rudders had been secured to keep them from snapping (<a href="/acts/27-17.htm">Acts 27:17</a>). Now they are freed so the ship can be steered. God-given direction matters after we&#8217;ve surrendered control; compare the Lord&#8217;s guidance of Israel by cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>) or the Spirit directing Philip toward the Ethiopian official (<a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The act teaches balanced dependence: release what hinders, then actively cooperate with God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hoisted the foresail to the wind</b><p>&#8220;Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The foresail (a small front sail) catches enough wind to move forward while maintaining control.

Now, under God&#8217;s direction, every piece of equipment&#8212;the rudders and the foresail&#8212;works together, echoing <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Made for the beach</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and made for the beach.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The goal is clear: a stretch of shoreline (<a href="/acts/27-39.htm">Acts 27:39</a>) where lives can be saved. Purpose replaces panic.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s confidence in God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>) energizes decisive action, mirroring how Joshua boldly led Israel across the Jordan after receiving God&#8217;s assurance (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation is the theme: just as the beach offers physical rescue, Christ provides ultimate deliverance (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a> shows seasoned sailors acting on a divine promise: cutting loose securities, freeing guidance systems, setting the sail, and aiming for safety.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in ver. 20; in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>; and in <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>; and in all those passages is rendered "<span class="accented">taken</span> away." So also in the LXX., where it is of frequent use, it means "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "<span class="accented">put</span> away," "<span class="accented">remove</span>," and the like. In classical Greek it means to "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "take off," "strip off." Here, then, applied to the anchors which were firmly embedded in the very strong clay at the bottom of the sea off Koura Point, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> means "putting away" or "casting off" the anchors by cutting the cables which fastened them to the ship, and, as it follows, <span class="cmt_word">leaving them in the sea</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">giving them up, dismissing them into the sea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Loosing the bands of the rudders</span>. "The ships of the Greeks and Romans, like those of the early Northmen were not steered by a single rudder, but by two paddle-rudders" (Howson, p. 310. See too an illustration from an ancient painting found at Herculaneum, in which the two paddle-rudders are very distinctly seen, at p. 346; and another illustration in Lewin, vol. it. p. 204, showing the two rudders and the foresail). These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "the bands of the rudders," and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. <span class="cmt_word">The foresail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a "pulley," and so explained in Ducange. But <span class="accented">artimon</span> was till recently used in Venice and Genoa as the name of the large sail of a vessel. In the Middle Ages <span class="accented">artimonium</span> was the "foremast," <span class="accented">mat de prone</span>; but it was also used of the foresail," Velum naris breve, quod quia melius levari potest, in summo periculo extenditur" (Ducange). They hoisted the foresail both to give them sufficient way to run on to the beach, and to give precision to their steering. (For a further account of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or foresail, see Smith, of Jordan Hill.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Cutting away</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(perielontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4014.htm">Strong's 4014: </a> </span><span class="str2">From peri and haireomai; to remove all around, i.e. Unveil, cast off; figuratively, to expiate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
