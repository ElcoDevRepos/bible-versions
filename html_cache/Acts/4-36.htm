He is later known as Barnabas, a key figure in the Acts of the Apostles. His Hebrew name, Joseph, connects him to the Jewish heritage and the tribe of Levi.<p><b>a Levite</b><br>As a Levite, Joseph belonged to the tribe of Levi, which was traditionally set apart for religious duties and service in the temple. This background may have influenced his later role in the church, as Levites were often involved in teaching and leadership. The Levites did not have a territorial inheritance like other tribes, which may have contributed to Joseph's mobility and missionary work.<p><b>from Cyprus</b><br>Cyprus is an island in the eastern Mediterranean, known for its strategic location and diverse population. Being from Cyprus suggests that Joseph was part of the Jewish diaspora, living outside of Israel. This background may have given him a broader perspective and ability to connect with both Jewish and Gentile communities, which was crucial in the early spread of Christianity.<p><b>whom the apostles called Barnabas</b><br>The apostles gave Joseph the name Barnabas, indicating their recognition of his character and contributions. This renaming is reminiscent of other biblical figures who received new names to signify a change in role or identity, such as Abram to Abraham or Simon to Peter. It highlights the apostles' authority and the transformative nature of following Christ.<p><b>(meaning Son of Encouragement)</b><br>The name Barnabas means "Son of Encouragement," reflecting his role in the early church as a source of support and motivation. Barnabas is known for his generosity, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-37.htm">Acts 4:37</a>, where he sells a field and donates the proceeds. His encouragement is further demonstrated in his mentorship of Paul and his involvement in missionary journeys. This characteristic aligns with the Christian call to build up and edify the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph (Barnabas)</a></b><br>A Levite from Cyprus, known for his role in the early church.

It signals acceptance into the core leadership of the church.<p>&#8226; Receiving this name from the apostles shows their discernment of spiritual gifting (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>). They see in Joseph a God-given quality valuable for the body (<a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The renaming also models healthy community: leaders notice, affirm, and label the grace they observe in others, urging them toward greater usefulness (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>(meaning Son of Encouragement)</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Encouragement&#8221; (parakl&#275;sis) describes comfort, exhortation, and advocacy&#8212;the same ministry title Jesus gives the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>: &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Barnabas embodies this gift:<p>&#8211; He vouches for newly converted Saul when others fear him (<a href="/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26-27</a>).<p>&#8211; He rejoices in God&#8217;s grace among Gentiles and urges them to remain faithful (<a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>).<p>&#8211; He patiently mentors Mark after Paul lets him go (<a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His example urges believers today to &#8220;encourage one another daily&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>) and to &#8220;build one another up&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; In a climate of persecution (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18-21</a>), such encouragement strengthens the church to remain bold (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a> introduces a real man, Joseph, whose priestly heritage, international background, and Spirit-given gift of encouragement make him a vital bridge in the early church.

It is possible, as Rabbinic writers often give <span class= "ital">Jose</span> for Joseph, that both were but different forms, like Simon and Simeon, of the same name. The later friendship between the Levite of Cyprus and St. Paul makes it probable that there had been some previous companionship (see Notes on <a href="/acts/9-27.htm" title="But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>), and it may well have been that he was sent from Cyprus to receive his education in the famous schools of Tarsus, or practised with Saul in early life the craft of tent-making, for which Tarsus was famous, and in which they were afterwards fellow-labourers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>). As a Levite he had probably taken his place in the ministries of the Temple, and may, therefore, have been among our Lord's actual hearers. His relation Mary, the mother of John surnamed Marcus, was, we know, living at Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>.) A tradition, as early as Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. ii.</span> ? 116), makes him one of the Seventy, and this agrees with the prophetic character which we have seen reason to think of as attaching to that body. (See. Note on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.) The new name which the Apostles gave him, literally, if we look to its Hebrew etymology, <span class= "ital">The son of prophecy, </span>or, taking St. Luke's translation, <span class= "ital">The son of counsel, </span>implies the possession of a special gift of persuasive utterance, in which the Apostles recognised the work of the Spirit. The Paraclete had endowed him with the gift of <span class= "ital">paraclesis, </span>in the sense in which that word included counsel, comfort, admonition, application of divine truth to the spiritual necessities of men. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus G. on St. John's Gospel.</span>) In <a href="/acts/11-23.htm" title="Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.">Acts 11:23</a>, we find him <span class= "ital">exhorting</span> the Gentile converts at Antioch, the verb being that from which <span class= "ital">paraclesis</span> is derived. He was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>conspicuous for the gift of prophecy as that gift is described in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1Corinthians 14:3</a>. The several stages in his life come before us later. An Epistle bearing his name, and recognised as his by Clement of Alexandria and Origen, is still extant, but its authenticity is, to say the least, questionable. It consists mainly of allegorical interpretations of Old Testament narratives. Some critics have assigned the Epistle to the Hebrews to his authorship, as the expounder of St. Paul's thoughts. It should be noted that a little further on his kinswoman Mary's house is the chief meeting-place of the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>), and that her son John, surnamed Mark, is mentioned by St. Peter ("Marcus my son," <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>) in words which make it almost certain that he was converted by that Apostle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- Joseph</span> for <span class="accented">Joses</span>, A.V., as <a href="/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <span class="accented">Son of exhortation</span> for <span class="accented">The son of consolation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Cyprus by race</span> for <span class="accented">and of the country of Cyprus</span>, A.V.

Probably his exhortations under the influence of the Holy Spirit in the Church assemblies were particularly stirring and edifying. The Greek version of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, should be rendered, as in R.V., <span class="cmt_word">Son of exhortation</span>, for "son of consolation? is a meaning which can hardly be got out of the Hebrew. The apostles seem here to have followed our Lord's example in naming the sons of Zebedee, sons of thunder. <span class="cmt_word">A man of Cyprus by race</span>. The A.V. is less accurate, but it gives the sense better. Cyprus was the country where he was born and lived, as, it is likely, his fathers had done before him. But he was hardly, in our sense of the words, a Cypriot by race. We know that a great many Jews were settled in Cyprus (Philo, 'Leg. ad Caium.,'&sect; 36; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:4; Alford, on <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and we learn from <a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a> that in Salamis alone there were several synagogues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/4-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Joseph,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#963;&#8052;&#966;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;s&#275;ph)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2501.htm">Strong's 2501: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph, a proper name.
