This act of standing is consistent with Jewish teaching practices and indicates Paul's role as a teacher and leader.<p><b>motioned with his hand</b><br>This gesture was a common way to gain attention and signal the beginning of a speech. It reflects Paul's intent to engage his audience and ensure they are focused on his message. Such gestures were typical in Greco-Roman rhetoric, which Paul, as a Roman citizen, would have been familiar with.<p><b>and began to speak</b><br>Paul's speaking here is significant as it marks the beginning of his first recorded sermon in Acts. This moment is pivotal in the spread of the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles, highlighting the transition of the message from a primarily Jewish audience to a broader one.<p><b>&#8220;Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God</b><br>Paul addresses two groups: Jews ("Men of Israel") and God-fearing Gentiles. The latter were non-Jews who respected the God of Israel and often attended synagogue services. This dual address underscores the inclusive nature of the Gospel, aligning with the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the Gentiles.<p><b>listen to me!</b><br>This call to attention emphasizes the importance of the message Paul is about to deliver. It echoes the prophetic tradition where speakers often called their audience to listen, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>. Paul is about to recount Israel's history and connect it to the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, urging his audience to recognize the significance of these events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>Formerly known as Saul, Paul is a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

Throughout Scripture, standing is the posture of proclamation and leadership (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22</a>). By rising in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch, Paul shows he is prepared to serve as God&#8217;s chosen messenger, echoing the Lord&#8217;s earlier word that he would be &#8220;a chosen vessel to carry My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>motioned with his hand</b><p>A simple gesture signals the desire for order and attention (<a href="/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>; 19:33; 21:40).<p>&#8226; The motion invites stillness, underscoring that what follows comes from God and deserves undivided focus.<p>&#8226; It mirrors the prophets who commanded attention before delivering the word (<a href="/1_kings/22-32.htm">1 Kings 22:32</a>).<p>Paul is not performing; he is shepherding the room toward reverent listening.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and began to speak</b><p>Luke often highlights the moment the gospel is verbalized (<a href="/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>; 18:4). Speaking is the appointed means by which faith is birthed (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-17</a>). Paul&#8217;s readiness fulfills Christ&#8217;s charge to &#8220;proclaim the word; be prepared in season and out of season&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). The transition from gesture to speech reminds us that the gospel cannot remain silent; it moves from heart to mouth for the salvation of hearers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Men of Israel</b><p>Paul first addresses the covenant people, recognizing their privileged history (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; He affirms their identity rooted in Abraham, Moses, and the prophets (<a href="/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By starting here, he honors God&#8217;s order: &#8220;to the Jew first&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>The phrase connects them to the promises now being fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23, 32</a>-33).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you Gentiles who fear God</b><p>The gospel&#8217;s reach is immediately widened.
