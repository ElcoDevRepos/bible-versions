The word of the Lord kept spreading in Antioch, but neither Paul nor Barnabas allowed busy local ministry to dull their sense of mission. Time passed&#8212;long enough for new converts in Galatia to need further grounding (cf. <a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27-28</a>). Their patience models the wisdom of waiting on God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul said to Barnabas</b><p>The initiative comes from Paul, yet he addresses his trusted co-laborer. Their partnership, birthed in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a> and tempered by shared trials (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19-20</a>), shows that ministry is not a solo effort. Jesus sent disciples out two by two (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), and &#8220;Two are better than one&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>). Seeking Barnabas&#8217;s agreement honors both accountability and friendship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us go back</b><p>Paul&#8217;s first instinct after evangelizing is not to push on to unexplored regions but to return. Earlier he had &#8220;returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, strengthening the disciples&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21-22</a>). The Great Commission includes &#8220;teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), making follow-up visits as essential as initial proclamation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and visit the brothers in every town</b><p>&#8220;Brothers&#8221; highlights the family bond created by the gospel (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1</a>). No church is too small or distant; every town deserves shepherding attention. By listing &#8220;every town,&#8221; Paul envisions a sweep through Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, and perhaps the smaller stops in between, demonstrating impartial pastoral care (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where we proclaimed the word of the Lord</b><p>Their earlier message was not their own philosophy but God&#8217;s authoritative word (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). Churches exist only because that word was preached, so maintaining their health means returning to the same Foundation. Fidelity to Scripture, rather than novelty, drives Paul and Barnabas.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see how they are doing</b><p>The goal is spiritual welfare, not statistics. Paul will later confess, &#8220;I was afraid that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might have been in vain&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>).
