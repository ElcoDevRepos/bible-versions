In the context of <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>, Paul is addressing the Athenians at the Areopagus, contrasting the living God with the idols made by human hands. Unlike the pagan gods who required temples and offerings, the God of the Bible is not dependent on human service. This reflects the Old Testament understanding found in <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-12</a>, where God declares that He owns all creation and does not need sacrifices from humans. Theologically, this underscores the doctrine of God's aseity, meaning He exists in and of Himself, needing nothing from creation.<p><b>as if He needed anything</b><br>This phrase further clarifies God's nature as self-sufficient. In the Greco-Roman world, gods were often thought to require human offerings to sustain their power or favor. However, the God of Israel is depicted as wholly independent, not requiring anything from His creation. This is consistent with <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, which describes God as the everlasting Creator who does not grow tired or weary. The idea that God needs nothing from us highlights His omnipotence and the grace He extends to humanity, not out of necessity, but out of love.<p><b>because He Himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else</b><br>This phrase shifts the focus from what God does not need to what He provides. God is the source of all life, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. The mention of "breath" connects to the Hebrew word "ruach," meaning spirit or breath, indicating the life-giving power of God. This also aligns with <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, where the Spirit of God is said to have made and given life. The phrase "everything else" encompasses all of creation, affirming God's providence and sovereignty over the universe. This provision is a testament to His grace and generosity, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26-30</a>, where Jesus speaks of God's care for all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, explaining the nature of the true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A city known for its rich history in philosophy and religion, where Paul delivers his sermon to the Athenians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/areopagus.htm">Areopagus</a></b><br>A prominent rock outcropping in Athens, serving as the meeting place for the council of elders, where Paul presents his message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_athenians.htm">The Athenians</a></b><br>The audience of Paul's sermon, known for their interest in new ideas and philosophies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unknown_god.htm">The Unknown God</a></b><br>Paul refers to an altar with the inscription "To an Unknown God," using it as a starting point to introduce the Athenians to the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_self-sufficiency.htm">God's Self-Sufficiency</a></b><br>God does not need anything from us.

Our role is not to meet His needs&#8212;He has none&#8212;but to respond in worship, obedience, and gratitude for His inexhaustible generosity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">as</span> <span class= "ital">needing anything in addition.</span> The previous words had struck at a false theory of temples, this strikes at a false theory of worship. Men have to think of God as the supreme Giver, not as requiring anything at their hands but justice, mercy, and truth. Both Jewish and heathen writers had borne their witness of the same truth: David had said, "Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it" (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16</a>), and the Latin Epicurean poet had written of the Divine nature, that it was--<p>"Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri,<p>Nec bene promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira."<p>["Strong in itself, it needeth nought of ours,<p>Is neither won by gifts, nor moved by wrath."]<p><span class= "ital">Lucret.</span> ii. 649-50.<p>The passage is found also in some editions in i. 61, 62.<p><span class= "bld">Life and breath.</span>--If we can draw a distinction between the two words, the first may be held to mean the higher element of man's life, the latter that which he shares, by virtue of his organization, with other animals.
