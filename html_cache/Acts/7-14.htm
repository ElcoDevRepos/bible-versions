This act of sending for his father Jacob signifies reconciliation and the fulfillment of God's providential plan. Joseph's actions reflect a type of Christ, who reconciles humanity to God. The narrative echoes <a href="/genesis/45-9.htm">Genesis 45:9-13</a>, where Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers and instructs them to bring Jacob to Egypt. This moment is pivotal in the history of Israel, as it sets the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and subsequent Exodus.<p><b>and all his relatives</b><br>The inclusion of all Jacob's relatives highlights the importance of family and community in God's covenantal promises. This move to Egypt was not just for survival during the famine but also a step in God's larger plan for the nation of Israel. The family of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, would grow into a great nation as promised to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>.

This discrepancy is often attributed to the inclusion of Joseph's grandchildren and great-grandchildren in the Septuagint's count. The number symbolizes completeness and God's faithfulness in preserving His people. It also foreshadows the multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>, fulfilling God's promise to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A key figure in the Genesis account, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.

Here, however, Stephen had the authority of the LXX. of <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm" title="And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.">Genesis 46:27</a>, which gives the number at seventy-five, and makes it up by inserting the son and grandson of Manasseh, two sons and a grandson of Ephraim. With them it was probably an editorial correction based upon <a href="/context/numbers/26-26.htm" title="Of the sons of Zebulun after their families: of Sered, the family of the Sardites: of Elon, the family of the Elonites: of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites.">Numbers 26:26-37</a>. Stephen, as a Hellenistic Jew, naturally accepted, without caring to investigate, the number which he found in the Greek version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- And Joseph sent</span> for <span class="accented">then sent Joseph</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">called to him Jacob his father</span> for c<span class="accented">alled his father Jacob to him</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Three score and fifteen souls</span>. In <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26, 27</a>, the statement is very precise that "all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten," including Joseph and his two sons. Moreover, the accuracy of the number is tested in two ways. First, the names of the sons and daughters of each patriarch are given, and they are found, on counting them, to amount to exactly seventy. And then the totals of the descendants of each of Jacob's four wives is given separately, and again the total is exactly seventy (33 + 16 + 14 + 7 = 70). It is true that the computation in ver. 26 does not agree with the above, for it makes the number of Jacob's descendants, exclusive of Joseph and his two sons, sixty-six instead of sixty-seven, which is the number according to the two above computations, and consequently the total number (when Joseph and his two sons are added) sixty-nine instead of seventy. But this is such a manifest contradiction that it seems almost a necessity to suppose a clerical error, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, caused perhaps by the preceding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. It is also a singular anomaly that, in the enumeration of Leah's descendants, as well as in the general enumeration, Er and Onan are distinctly reckoned as well as <span class="accented">mentioned</span>. Jacob himself is nowhere reckoned in the Bible, though he is in the commentaries. But when we turn to the LXX., we find that in <a href="/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a> there are added to Manasseh and Ephraim Machir the son and Gilead the grandson of Manasseh; and Suthelah and Taam the sons, and Edom (meaning Eran, <span class="accented">LXX.</span> Eden, <a href="/numbers/26-36.htm">Numbers 26:36</a>) the grandson, of Ephraim, making the descendants of Rachel eighteen (it should be nineteen if <span class="accented">Huppim</span>, <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, is added) instead of fourteen; the number sixty-six of ver. 26 is preserved; the number of Joseph's descendants is given as nine (Huppim apparently being now reckoned), which, added to sixty-six, makes seventy-five; and accordingly in ver. 27 the LXX. read <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("seventy-five souls"), instead of "three score and <span class="accented">ten."</span> But except in the addition of these five names of Joseph's grand and great-grand-children, the LXX. support the Hebrew text, even in the strange <span class="accented">sixty-six</span> of ver. 26. Stephen, as a Hellenist, naturally follows the LXX. But the question arises - How are we to understand the lists? <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a> says, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;" and one naturally expects to find the names only of those who are described in vers. 5-7 as the migratory party from Canaan to Egypt. This expectation is somewhat disturbed by Er and Onan being included in the enumeration. This may, however, be accounted for by Pharez and Zerah being reckoned as their seed. But is it likely that Hezron and Hamul the sons of Pharez, and the other great-grandsons of Jacob, were born before the descent into Egypt? The answer to this is that, as Jacob was a hundred and thirty years old when he came down to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/47-28.htm">Genesis 47:28</a>), there is no improbability in his having great-grandchildren (allowing forty years for a generation); on the contrary, every likelihood that he should. But on the other hand, as Joseph could not have been above fifty when Jacob came down to Egypt (30 + 14 + X.), <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46, 29, 30</a>, it does not seem likely or possible that Joseph should have had grown-up grandsons and a great-grandson, as the LXX. make him have. Indeed, to all appearance Manasseh and Ephraim were unmarried young men at the time that Jacob blessed them (<a href="/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11, 16</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). Therefore we may conclude certainly that the additional numbers of the LXX. are incorrect, if understood literally, of these who came down with Jacob from Canaan to Egypt. But there is nothing improbable in Benjamin having ten children. Judah, to whom grandchildren are attributed, was Jacob's fourth son, and might be forty or fifty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Asher, to whom also grandsons are attributed, was the eighth son, and might be twenty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Still, considering that Er and Onan are reckoned among those who came down to Egypt, it would not be surprising to find that some of those mentioned in the list were born after Jacob's arrival, but included on some principle which we do not understand. In other words, a literal interpretation of the statement of the Hebrew Bible involves no impossibilities, but a literal interpretation of the statement of the LXX. does. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joseph</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#963;&#8052;&#966;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;s&#275;ph)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2501.htm">Strong's 2501: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph, a proper name.
