The apostles are addressing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, and by extension, all of Israel. This reflects the early church's mission to witness to the Jewish people first, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of the message being proclaimed openly and without fear, fulfilling the Great Commission to spread the gospel to all nations, starting with Israel.<p><b>It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth:</b><br>The mention of "Jesus Christ of Nazareth" highlights both His humanity and His divine mission. "Nazareth" identifies Jesus with a specific, humble origin, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's humble beginnings. The use of "name" signifies authority and power, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus. This phrase asserts that the power to heal and perform miracles comes solely through Jesus, affirming His divine authority.<p><b>whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead:</b><br>This statement directly confronts the Jewish leaders with their role in Jesus' crucifixion, as seen in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/27-22.htm">Matthew 27:22-25</a>). It also affirms the core Christian belief in the resurrection, a pivotal event that validates Jesus' claims and the apostles' preaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). The contrast between human actions ("you crucified") and divine intervention ("God raised") highlights God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His redemptive plan, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<p><b>that this man stands before you healed:</b><br>The healing of the lame man (<a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1-10</a>) serves as a tangible demonstration of Jesus' power and the truth of the apostles' message. This miracle fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messianic age, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the lame will leap like a deer. The healed man standing before the council is a living testimony to the transformative power of faith in Jesus, reinforcing the apostles' claim that Jesus is the source of life and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were speaking to the people and the religious leaders in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ_of_nazareth.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, crucified and resurrected, whose name and power are proclaimed by the apostles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council and religious leaders who questioned Peter and John about the healing of a man.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>A man who was lame from birth and was healed by Peter and John in the name of Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant as the center of Jewish religious life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_name.htm">The Power of Jesus' Name</a></b><br>The name of Jesus is not just a label but carries divine authority and power.
