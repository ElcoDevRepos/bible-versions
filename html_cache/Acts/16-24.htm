In Roman culture, orders from authorities were to be followed without question, reflecting the strict hierarchical structure of Roman society. This command underscores the perceived threat Paul and Silas posed to the public order, as they were accused of causing an uproar in Philippi.<p><b>he placed them in the inner cell</b><br>The inner cell was the most secure part of the prison, often reserved for the most dangerous criminals. This placement highlights the severity with which Paul and Silas were treated, despite their peaceful mission. The inner cell was likely dark, damp, and isolated, symbolizing the spiritual darkness and bondage from which they were delivering others through the Gospel. This setting also foreshadows the miraculous events that would soon occur, demonstrating God's power to liberate both physically and spiritually.<p><b>and fastened their feet in the stocks</b><br>Stocks were a form of torture and restraint, designed to inflict pain and prevent escape. This treatment reflects the hostility faced by early Christians and the lengths to which authorities would go to suppress the spread of Christianity.

And, as if this were not enough, they were fastened in the "stocks." St. Luke uses the Greek term <span class= "ital">xylon, </span>the same as is used sometimes for the cross (<a href="/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="/acts/13-29.htm" title="And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.">Acts 13:29</a>). The technical Latin word was <span class= "ital">nervus.</span> Like the English stocks, it was a wooden frame with five holes, into which head and feet and arms were thrust, and the prisoner left in an attitude of "little-ease." Here, however, it would seem, the feet only were fastened, the rest of the body being left lying on the ground. If the Received version of <a href="/job/13-27.htm" title="You put my feet also in the stocks, and look narrowly to all my paths; you set a print on the heels of my feet.">Job 13:27</a>; <a href="/job/33-11.htm" title="He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.">Job 33:11</a>, which follows the LXX. and the Vulgate, be correct, the punishment was common at a very early period in the East.
