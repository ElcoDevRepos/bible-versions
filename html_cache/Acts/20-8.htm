In the ancient world, oil lamps were commonly used for lighting, and their presence suggests a significant gathering, possibly to accommodate a large group. The use of lamps also symbolizes the light of the Gospel being shared among believers, reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a> about being the light of the world.<p><b>in the upper room</b><br>The upper room was a common feature in Jewish homes, often used for dining or gatherings. It holds significant biblical importance, as it was in an upper room where Jesus shared the Last Supper with His disciples (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12-13</a>). This setting for the early church's meeting reflects continuity with Jesus' ministry and the intimate fellowship among believers. The upper room also symbolizes a place of prayer and unity, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13-14</a>, where the disciples gathered after Jesus' ascension.<p><b>where we were gathered</b><br>The use of "we" indicates the presence of the author, traditionally understood to be Luke, suggesting an eyewitness account. The gathering of believers in this context highlights the communal aspect of early Christian worship and fellowship. This assembly reflects the practice of the early church to meet regularly for teaching, breaking of bread, and prayer, as described in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>. The gathering also emphasizes the importance of community in the Christian faith, as believers come together to support and encourage one another in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>.

The word signals a transition that keeps the reader in the flow of an eyewitness account. Similar temporal markers appear throughout Luke&#8217;s writings, underscoring historical accuracy (e.g., <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>). We are reminded that biblical events unfold in actual moments, not myths or legends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were many lamps</b><p>&#8226; Oil lamps were the common source of evening light, indicating the meeting stretched well into the night.<p>&#8226; Their abundance shows foresight and hospitality; believers ensured everyone could see and safely participate (compare <a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical light also mirrors spiritual light. In the same way lamps pushed back physical darkness, the teaching of God&#8217;s Word dispels spiritual darkness (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail hints at warmth and perhaps stuffiness&#8212;factors that later contribute to young Eutychus&#8217;s fatigue (<a href="/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>). Scripture never shies away from gritty reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the upper room</b><p>&#8226; An upper room provided privacy from street noise and space for a larger group, much like the room where Jesus celebrated the Last Supper (<a href="/mark/14-15.htm">Mark 14:15</a>) and where the disciples later met in prayer (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Elevated settings often became places of revelation and fellowship, echoing Elijah&#8217;s prayer in an upstairs chamber (<a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting signals continuity: God&#8217;s people consistently gather in dedicated spaces, whether house-church rooms, synagogues, or modern sanctuaries (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where we were gathered</b><p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s use of &#8220;we&#8221; shows he was physically present, lending firsthand reliability (<a href="/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>; 27:1).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gathered&#8221; highlights intentional assembly. The church is more than scattered believers&#8212;it is a body that meets for worship, Word, and mutual encouragement (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; This simple clause captures the blessing of shared faith: when believers come together, Christ is uniquely in their midst (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every word of <a href="/acts/20-8.htm">Acts 20:8</a> is purposeful. Luke situates us in a real moment&#8212;late at night, an upstairs room aglow with many lamps, believers huddled around Paul&#8217;s teaching. The detail of the lamps stresses both practical care and spiritual symbolism; the upper room links this meeting with other pivotal gatherings in salvation history; the inclusive &#8220;we&#8221; underscores eyewitness authenticity and the beauty of Christian fellowship. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s work often happens in ordinary settings lit by faithful provision, where His people assemble to hear His Word and shine His light in the darkness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And there were many lights in the upper chamber.</span>--We learn from <a href="/acts/20-9.htm" title="And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.">Acts 20:9</a> that it was on the third floor of the house. In the high narrow streets of Eastern towns the upper storey is often chosen for social or devotional purposes, partly as more removed from the noise of the street, partly as giving access to the roof of the house. Such a room in a good sized house might well hold two or three hundred people. It is a fair inference also that the vividness and minuteness of the account indicate that we have the narrative of an eye-witness. The <span class= "ital">lamps</span> or <span class= "ital">torches</span> (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-3.htm" title="They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:">Matthew 25:3</a>; <a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>) are probably mentioned, partly as accounting for the sleep of Eutychus by the heat and closeness of the room, partly, perhaps, as an indirect answer to the calumny loudly asserted afterwards (Tertull. <span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 8), and probably even then whispered, that at the meetings of the Christians the lamps were extinguished and free scope given for deeds of shameless licence. There is no ground for assuming that the lamps at this early period had any distinctive ritual or symbolic character, though it would be a natural expression of respect that two or more should be placed in front of the Apostle, or other presiding elder, at such a meeting, on either side of the loaf which was to be broken, and the cup which was to be blest. The position of the celebrant (to use a later, but convenient term) may have been, as in the original institution of the Supper, recumbent on the <span class= "ital">triclinium, </span>or couch, which was at this time used by both Greeks and Romans. It is obvious, however, that this would be an inconvenient posture for distribution to a large assembly, and the special mention of "the Lord's table" in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm" title="You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.">1Corinthians 10:21</a>, leads to the conclusion that there was a separate high table (to borrow the familiar language of a college or Inn of Court) at which the celebrant and other ministers sat, their backs to the wall, their faces to the people, and that from that table they distributed the bread and wine, either by taking them, or sending them by the deacons or other ministers, to those who sat in the body of the room, or by giving it to the congregation as they came up to the table in detachments. The later practice of the Church, and the absence of any indication in patristic writings that there was an abrupt change, makes the latter the more probable alternative. The table, so placed, served as a transition stage between the <span class= "ital">triclinium</span> and the altar of the later basilica. The primitive arrangement in which the priest faces the congregation and stands behind the altar, it may be noted, was at first retained in most of the basilicas, and survives to the present day in some of the churches of that type in Rome--as, for example, in that of S. Clemente. This, therefore, and not any eastward or southward position, may claim to be, as has been well said, "at once the most primitive, the most Catholic, the most Protestant" of Eucharistic usages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- We</span> for <span class="accented">they</span>, A.V. and T.R. It is not obvious why St. Luke mentions the <span class="cmt_word">many lights</span>. Some say to mark the solemnity of the first day of the week (Kuinoel); some, to remove all possible occasion of scandal as regards such midnight meetings (Bengel); some, to explain how the young man's fall was immediately perceived (Meyer); others, to account for the young man's drowsiness, which would be increased by the many lights, possibly making the room hot (Alford); for ornament (Olshausen). But possibly it is the mere mention by an eye-witness of a fact which struck him. It is obvious that the room must have been lit for a night meeting - only perhaps there were more lights than usual. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there were</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7982;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
