His ministry in Samaria follows the persecution in Jerusalem, which scattered the believers. The Samaritans, historically at odds with the Jews, are now receptive to the message of the gospel, showing the breaking down of ethnic and religious barriers. This belief marks a significant shift in the early church's mission, expanding beyond Jewish communities.<p><b>as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God</b><br>The "kingdom of God" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, emphasizing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. Philip's message likely included the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, aligning with the prophecies of the Old Testament. This preaching signifies the continuation of Jesus' mission through His disciples, highlighting the inclusivity of the gospel.<p><b>and the name of Jesus Christ</b><br>The name of Jesus Christ carries authority and power, as seen throughout the New Testament. Preaching in His name implies proclaiming His identity as the Messiah and Savior. This is crucial for the Samaritans, who had their own messianic expectations. The emphasis on Jesus' name underscores the early church's Christocentric focus and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies.<p><b>they were baptized</b><br>Baptism is a public declaration of faith and an act of obedience, symbolizing the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. It represents cleansing from sin and entry into the Christian community. The immediate response of baptism indicates the genuine conversion and acceptance of the gospel message by the Samaritans.<p><b>both men and women</b><br>The inclusion of both men and women highlights the egalitarian nature of the early Christian movement. In a cultural context where women often had a secondary status, the gospel's reach to both genders demonstrates its transformative power and the breaking down of societal barriers. This inclusivity reflects the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>) about the outpouring of the Spirit on all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip is now an evangelist spreading the gospel in Samaria.
