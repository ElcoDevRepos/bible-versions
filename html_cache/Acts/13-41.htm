In <a href="/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, Paul uses this Old Testament reference to address the Jewish audience in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch. The term "scoffers" refers to those who mock or dismiss God's message. Historically, scoffers were often those who rejected the prophets' warnings, leading to their downfall. The call to "wonder and perish" serves as a stark warning that disbelief in God's works leads to destruction. This reflects a common biblical theme where disbelief and rejection of God's message result in judgment, as seen in the stories of Noah's flood and Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>&#8216;For I am doing a work in your days&#8217;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the immediacy and relevance of God's actions. In Habakkuk's time, it referred to the surprising and swift rise of the Babylonians as a tool of judgment. In the context of Acts, Paul is highlighting the work of God through Jesus Christ and the spread of the Gospel. The "work" in their days is the fulfillment of messianic prophecies and the establishment of the New Covenant. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God acts within history to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the Exodus and the return from Babylonian exile.<p><b>&#8216;that you would never believe&#8217;</b><br>This phrase underscores the unexpected nature of God's work. In Habakkuk's context, the idea that God would use a pagan nation like Babylon to execute judgment was unthinkable to the Israelites. Similarly, in Acts, the notion that salvation would come through a crucified Messiah and extend to the Gentiles was difficult for many Jews to accept. This disbelief is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, where the suffering servant is described in terms that were hard for the people to comprehend. The theme of God's ways being higher than human understanding is prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>&#8216;even if someone told you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the stubbornness and hardness of heart that can prevent people from accepting divine truth, even when clearly presented. In the biblical narrative, prophets often faced rejection despite their clear messages, as seen with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. In the New Testament, Jesus Himself was rejected by many despite His teachings and miracles. This reflects a broader spiritual principle that faith is required to truly understand and accept God's work. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and openness to God's revelation, as emphasized in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, they were on their first missionary journey, spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch_in_pisidia.htm">Antioch in Pisidia</a></b><br>A city in modern-day Turkey where Paul and Barnabas preached in the synagogue, addressing both Jews and God-fearing Gentiles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The setting where Paul delivered his message, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures to connect with his Jewish audience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Specifically, the prophet Habakkuk, whose words Paul quotes to warn the listeners of disbelief and its consequences.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Composed of Jews and Gentile converts to Judaism, who were familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures and the prophecies concerning the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_disbelief.htm">The Danger of Disbelief</a></b><br>Just as in Habakkuk's time, disbelief in God's work leads to spiritual peril.

Scripture speaks literally, faithfully, and urgently: behold the work, believe the gospel, and live.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Behold, ye despisers.</span>--The quotation is from the LXX. version, the Hebrew giving "Behold, ye among the heathen." So, in the next clause, "wonder, and perish" takes the place of "wonder marvellously." The fact that St. Paul quotes from the prophet (<a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a>) whose teaching (<a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>) that "the just by faith shall live" becomes henceforth the axiom of his life, is not without a special interest. The "work" of which the prophet spoke was defined in the following verse as the raising up the Chaldeans, "that bitter and hasty nation," to execute God's judgment. St. Paul may have had in his thoughts the like judgment about to be executed by the Romans, and already known as foretold by Christ (<a href="/context/matthew/24-2.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Matthew 24:2-28</a>), or may have thus dimly indicated that which was so closely connected with it--the rejection of Israel, because they, as a nation, had rejected Christ. The sharp tone of warning, as in St. Stephen's speech (see Note on <a href="/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>), suggests the thought that signs of anger and impatience had already begun to show themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> <span class="accented">- If one</span> for <span class="accented">though a man</span>, A.V.

The difference from the Hebrew arises from the LXX. having read in their copy <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, proud, arrogant men (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;</span>), for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, among the heathen, as is clear from their rendering the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, in <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a> and Habakkuk 2:5, by the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>). The rendering <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, and perish, for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (another form of the preceding verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which in the A.V. is construed with it, and the two together rendered "wonder marvelously"), is not so easily explained. The two best explanations seem to be <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the LXX. read <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> instead of the present order of the words, and so rendered the first word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, wonder, and, taking the next word from another root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered it <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, perish; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, reading the words in the same order in which they now stand in the Hebrew text, they rendered the first <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">or</span>, with the intensive addition, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, and took the second in the sense it has in Arabic, "to be altered" or "changed for the worse," and expressed it by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, meaning" change countenance from fear and astonishment." And in favor of this explanation the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a> ("they disfigure their faces") is quoted (see Rosenm&uuml;ller on <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>). St. Paul took the LXX. as he found it. Perhaps he saw signs in some of that unbelief and perverse opposition which afterwards broke out (ver. 45), and so was led to close his sermon with words of awful warning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8216;Look,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7996;&#948;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Idete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[you]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
