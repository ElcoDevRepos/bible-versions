It highlights the divine intervention and the fulfillment of God's plan, emphasizing the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His servants. This moment of realization is a turning point, showcasing Peter's awareness of God's active role in his life.<p><b>he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark</b><br>Mary's house served as a central meeting place for early Christians in Jerusalem. This Mary is the mother of John Mark, who would later accompany Paul and Barnabas on missionary journeys and is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of Mark. The mention of her house indicates the importance of familial connections and hospitality in the early church. It also suggests that Mary was a woman of some means, able to host a large gathering. This setting provides a glimpse into the domestic spaces that were crucial for the early Christian community.<p><b>where many people had gathered together and were praying</b><br>The gathering for prayer reflects the early church's reliance on communal prayer, especially in times of crisis. This scene underscores the power of collective prayer and the faith of the believers, who were interceding for Peter's release. It also highlights the unity and perseverance of the early Christians, who faced persecution yet remained steadfast in their faith. This communal prayer meeting is reminiscent of other instances in Acts where prayer precedes significant events, such as the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>) and the appointment of Matthias (<a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who was miraculously freed from prison by an angel.
