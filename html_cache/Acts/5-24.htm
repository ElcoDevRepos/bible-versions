This position was responsible for maintaining order within the temple precincts, which was a central place of worship and sacrifice in Jerusalem. The chief priests were part of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council of the Jews, which included Sadducees and Pharisees. This group was often in opposition to the early Christian movement, as seen in their previous interactions with Jesus and His followers. The account they heard likely referred to the miraculous escape of the apostles from prison, an event that challenged their authority and understanding of divine intervention.<p><b>they were perplexed</b><br>The perplexity of the temple authorities highlights their inability to comprehend the power and work of God through the apostles. This reaction is consistent with their previous encounters with Jesus, where they often failed to understand His teachings and miracles. Their confusion also underscores the spiritual blindness that Jesus often addressed, as they were unable to see the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in the actions and teachings of the apostles.<p><b>as to what was happening</b><br>The events surrounding the apostles were unprecedented and challenged the established religious order. The miraculous escape from prison, without any human intervention, suggested divine involvement, which the religious leaders could not easily dismiss. This situation echoes the confusion and fear experienced by the guards at Jesus' tomb after His resurrection, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a>. The inability of the religious leaders to control or explain these events pointed to the growing influence and divine backing of the early Christian church, fulfilling Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that His followers would receive power from the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/captain_of_the_temple_guard.htm">Captain of the Temple Guard</a></b><br>This individual was responsible for maintaining order in the temple precincts.
