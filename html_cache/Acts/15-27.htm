Judas and Silas were chosen as representatives of the Jerusalem church, indicating their trustworthiness and leadership. Silas, also known as Silvanus, later became a close associate of Paul, accompanying him on his missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>). This decision reflects the early Church's commitment to unity and clear communication, ensuring that the message was consistent and authoritative.<p><b>to tell you in person</b><br>The personal delivery of the message underscores the importance of direct communication in resolving disputes and ensuring clarity. In the ancient world, personal messengers were often used to convey important information, as written documents could be misinterpreted or altered. This method also allowed for immediate clarification and discussion, which was crucial in maintaining unity within the diverse body of believers. The presence of Judas and Silas would have provided reassurance and authority to the Gentile believers in Antioch, confirming the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.<p><b>the same things we are writing</b><br>The consistency between the spoken message and the written letter highlights the importance of reliability and truthfulness in the early Church's communication. The letter, as recorded in <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23-29</a>, addressed the requirements for Gentile believers, emphasizing freedom from the full yoke of the Mosaic Law while encouraging abstention from certain practices. This dual approach of written and oral communication ensured that the message was preserved accurately and that the recipients understood the intent and spirit behind the decisions. This practice reflects the broader biblical principle of establishing truth through multiple witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas.htm">Judas (also called Barsabbas)</a></b><br>A leading member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, chosen to accompany Paul and Barnabas to Antioch to deliver the council's decision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas.htm">Silas</a></b><br>Another prominent member of the Jerusalem church, who later becomes a missionary companion of Paul.
