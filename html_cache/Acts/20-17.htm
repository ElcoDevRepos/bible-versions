It was a significant port city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its strategic location and cultural influence. In the context of <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, Miletus serves as a convenient meeting point for Paul, who is on his way to Jerusalem. The city&#8217;s proximity to Ephesus, about 30 miles away, makes it an ideal location for Paul to summon the Ephesian elders without having to enter the city itself, which might have delayed his journey.<p><b>Paul sent to Ephesus</b><br>Ephesus was a major city in the Roman Empire, known for its temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was a center of commerce and religion, and Paul had spent a significant amount of time there during his missionary journeys, establishing a strong Christian community. By sending for the elders, Paul demonstrates his ongoing concern and responsibility for the churches he helped to establish. This action reflects the apostolic practice of maintaining oversight and providing guidance to the early Christian communities.<p><b>for the elders of the church</b><br>The term "elders" refers to the leaders of the Christian community in Ephesus. In the early church, elders were responsible for teaching, shepherding, and overseeing the spiritual well-being of the congregation. This role is consistent with the Jewish tradition of elders serving as leaders and decision-makers within the community. The calling of the elders highlights the importance of leadership and accountability within the church. It also underscores the early church's structure, which included a plurality of elders rather than a single leader, ensuring a balanced and collective leadership approach. This meeting is significant as it provides Paul an opportunity to impart final instructions and warnings, emphasizing the continuity of his ministry and the importance of vigilance against false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his third missionary journey.

He loves these believers deeply (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>).<p>&#8211; By summoning the elders rather than returning himself, Paul both saves time on his journey to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a>) and spares the church another public stir.<p>&#8211; The short distance means they can come quickly, illustrating the closeness and responsiveness between shepherd and flock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the elders</b><p>&#8211; Elders (also called overseers, <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>) are the God-appointed shepherds of the congregation. Paul had earlier &#8220;appointed elders in every church&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>).<p>&#8211; Their calling involves teaching sound doctrine (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>) and guarding against wolves (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>).<p>&#8211; By gathering them, Paul models accountability and mentorship&#8212;traits echoed in <a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1-3</a>, where elders are urged to shepherd willingly and exemplify Christlike humility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the church</b><p>&#8211; The phrase grounds leadership in a particular local body.

The Ephesian church later receives Jesus&#8217; personal message in <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1-7</a>, underscoring its ongoing significance.<p>&#8211; Paul&#8217;s concern reminds us that faithful leadership is inseparable from a defined, accountable community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a> records a single sentence, yet each phrase reveals Paul&#8217;s strategic heart: from a quiet harbor, he purposefully summons trusted elders of a dearly loved church to equip them for the challenges ahead. The verse underscores intentional leadership, close pastoral relationships, and the vital role of local church elders in guarding and guiding God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</span>--We find, from <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, that they were known also as <span class= "ital">episcopi</span> ("bishops," or "overseers"), the two names being interchangeable at this period, and the Apostle standing in relation to those who bore them as the later Bishop did to the elders under him. (See Notes on <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/context/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1-2</a>.) The many presbyters represented probably, each of them, a distinct church or congregation. Most, if not all, of these must have been ordained by the Apostle himself. He had found them loyal, faithful, singularly receptive of the truth (<a href="/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm" title="Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)">Ephesians 3:4</a>). He was passing, as he thought, to far-off regions, never to revisit them, and he was naturally anxious to give them parting words of counsel and of warning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Called to him</span> for <span class="accented">called</span>, A.V.

The distinctive names and functions of Church officers were not yet fixed; and the apostles themselves, aided by degrees by such as Timothy and Titus, were what we now call bishops, exercising oversight over the elders themselves as well as over the whole flock (see <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>).
