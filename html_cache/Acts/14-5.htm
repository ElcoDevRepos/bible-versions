Historically, Jews and Gentiles often had significant cultural and religious differences, but here they are united in their hostility. This reflects the growing tension and resistance to the early Christian message, which was seen as a threat to both Jewish religious traditions and Gentile societal norms. The collaboration between these groups underscores the widespread nature of the opposition faced by the apostles.<p><b>together with their rulers</b><br>The involvement of rulers indicates that the opposition was not just from the general populace but also had official backing. This suggests a significant level of threat to the apostles, as rulers had the authority to enforce punishments. In the Roman Empire, local rulers often had considerable power and could be influenced by public opinion or the desire to maintain order. This involvement of rulers also reflects the political dimensions of the early Christian movement, which was sometimes perceived as subversive.<p><b>set out to mistreat and stone them</b><br>The intention to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas shows the severity of the opposition. Stoning was a common form of execution for blasphemy in Jewish law, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). This indicates that the apostles were likely accused of blasphemy or similar charges. The mention of mistreatment suggests a broader range of potential abuses, reflecting the hostility and violence that early Christians often faced. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of persecution in the New Testament, where followers of Christ are warned of suffering for their faith (e.g., <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles_and_jews.htm">Gentiles and Jews</a></b><br>These groups represent the diverse audience that Paul and Barnabas were addressing.
