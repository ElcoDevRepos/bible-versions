This eyewitness testimony is crucial for the credibility of the Gospel message. In Jewish law, the testimony of two or three witnesses was required to establish a fact (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The apostles' role as witnesses fulfills this requirement, providing a solid foundation for the truth of the Gospel. Their witness is not just of His miracles and teachings but also of His resurrection, which is central to Christian faith (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the geographical scope of Jesus' ministry. "The land of the Jews" refers to the broader region of Judea, while "Jerusalem" is the specific city where significant events, including Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, took place. Jerusalem was the religious and cultural center of Judaism, and Jesus' activities there fulfilled numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. His ministry in these areas underscores His role as the promised Messiah to the Jewish people.<p><b>And although they put Him to death by hanging Him on a tree</b><br>This phrase refers to the crucifixion of Jesus, a method of execution used by the Romans. The term "hanging Him on a tree" is significant because it connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, where being hung on a tree is associated with being cursed by God. This connection highlights the theological significance of Jesus' death, as He bore the curse of sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). The crucifixion was a fulfillment of prophecy, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretold the suffering and death of the Messiah. Despite the shame associated with crucifixion, it was through this act that Jesus accomplished the work of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage, sharing the gospel with Cornelius and his household.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the gospel message, whose life, death, and resurrection are being testified to.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The people among whom Jesus conducted His ministry, fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where significant events of Jesus' ministry, including His crucifixion, took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event of Jesus being put to death by hanging on a tree, a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and a pivotal moment in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_witnesses.htm">The Role of Witnesses</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be witnesses of Christ's work in our lives, just as the apostles were witnesses of His earthly ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' death on the cross was not an accident but a fulfillment of God's redemptive plan as foretold in the Scriptures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The message of salvation through Jesus is for all people, as demonstrated by Peter's sharing of the gospel with Gentiles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_redemption.htm">The Cost of Redemption</a></b><br>Reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice, understanding that He bore the curse of sin for our sake.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_witnesses.htm">Living as Witnesses</a></b><br>Consider how our lives can testify to the truth of the gospel in our daily interactions and relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_10_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 10:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_witness_effectively_today.htm">How can we be effective witnesses like those in Acts 10:39 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_do_witnesses_teach_about_testimony.htm">What does "witnesses of all He did" teach about Christian testimony?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_10_39_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Acts 10:39 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_testify_Jesus_works_locally.htm">Why is it important to testify about Jesus' works in our communities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_39_Inspire_bold_faith_sharing.htm">How can Acts 10:39 inspire us to share our faith more boldly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_39_Proof_of_Jesus_crucifixion.htm">How does Acts 10:39 affirm the historical reality of Jesus' crucifixion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Acts_10_39_eyewitnesses.htm">What evidence supports the eyewitness accounts mentioned in Acts 10:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Acts_10_39_key_to_Christian_faith.htm">Why is the testimony in Acts 10:39 crucial for Christian faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_i_discipline_my_body_and_control_it.htm">What does 'The joy of the Lord is your strength' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_hanging_cursed_in_deut._21_22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22&#8211;23: Why is a person hung on a tree considered cursed, and how does this align with New Testament references to Christ&#8217;s crucifixion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/jeremiah_39_9-10__are_exile_claims_reliable.htm">Jeremiah 39:9-10: How reliable are the claims about who was exiled and who remained in the land, considering possible discrepancies with other historical accounts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/was_pauland#8217;s_duty_specified_immediately.htm">Did the voice immediately specify Paul's duties?
