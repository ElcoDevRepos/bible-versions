Waiting seasons can feel endless, yet this phrase reminds us that heaven&#8217;s timetable is precise and purposeful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham</b><p>The center of the verse is covenant faithfulness. From <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> through 17:7-8, God pledged land, nationhood, and blessing to Abraham; <a href="/acts/7-17.htm">Acts 7:17</a> shows that pledge advancing. <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a> says God bound Himself with an oath so our hope would be unshakable. Even Mary celebrated that God was &#8220;remembering His holy covenant, the oath He swore to our father Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72-73</a>). Stephen&#8217;s audience knew those promises; he proclaims that the God who spoke them is now keeping them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our people in Egypt increased greatly in number</b><p>Growth under pressure displays God&#8217;s power. <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a> reports, &#8220;the Israelites were fruitful and increased greatly&#8230; so that the land was filled with them,&#8221; a direct fulfillment of <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>&#8217;s &#8220;count the stars&#8221; promise.
