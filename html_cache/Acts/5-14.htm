The apostles' teachings and the signs and wonders performed among the people (<a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>) contributed to this increase. The phrase "brought to the Lord" indicates a conversion experience, where individuals accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. This growth fulfills Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." The early church's expansion is a testament to the power of the Holy Spirit working through the apostles.<p><b>large numbers of both men and women</b><br>The inclusion of both men and women signifies the breaking of social and cultural barriers in the early church. In a patriarchal society, the mention of women as part of the growing number of believers is significant. It reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." This growth also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which Peter referenced in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>, indicating that God's Spirit would be poured out on all people, regardless of gender.

Earlier, 3,000 were added in one day (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>), then about 5,000 men (<a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>). Now the pace keeps accelerating. God&#8217;s pattern is clear: wherever Christ is faithfully preached and the church walks in holiness (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>) and power (<a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12-13</a>), growth follows. Just as Jesus promised, the mustard seed keeps spreading its branches (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>), and the gates of Hades cannot prevail (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>believers</b><p>Those being added are expressly called &#8220;believers,&#8221; identical to the description in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>: &#8220;All the believers were one in heart and mind.&#8221; Salvation is not mere interest or attendance; it is personal trust in the risen Christ (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; 3:16). Luke stresses authentic conversion, echoing the call Peter gave at Pentecost: &#8220;Repent and be baptized&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). God is growing a community defined by faith, not by heritage or ritual (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were brought to the Lord</b><p>No one drifts into the kingdom by accident; they are &#8220;brought.&#8221; God draws people (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>) through Spirit-empowered witness (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The miracles in Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade (<a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>) verified the apostles&#8217; message, but it was the Lord Himself who saved (<a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>). The wording reminds us the church&#8217;s task is to lead people to Christ, not simply to religion (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>large numbers</b><p>Luke loves to highlight God&#8217;s arithmetic: added (<a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>), multiplied (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>), increased greatly (<a href="/acts/12-24.htm">Acts 12:24</a>). &#8220;Large numbers&#8221; underscores that the gospel is sufficient for crowds, not just individuals (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). While each soul matters, Scripture also celebrates sweeping harvests (<a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35-38</a>). This verse invites us to expect God-sized results when He moves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both men and women</b><p>In a culture often dominated by male headcounts, Luke is careful to honor the women God is calling. He did the same at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; 2:17-18) and will again with Lydia (<a href="/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13-15</a>) and many others. The Spirit is poured out &#8220;on all people,&#8221; fulfilling Joel&#8217;s prophecy. Salvation levels the ground at the cross (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), welcoming every believer into full participation and gifting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a> paints a vibrant picture of a holy, Spirit-filled church: momentum building, genuine faith spreading, Christ Himself drawing multitudes, and both men and women embraced in equal measure.
