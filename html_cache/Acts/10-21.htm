This event occurs in Joppa, a coastal city with historical significance as the place where Jonah attempted to flee from God's command to go to Nineveh, highlighting themes of obedience and mission. Peter's descent also symbolizes humility and readiness to serve, aligning with Jesus' teachings on servanthood (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Here am I,</b><br>Peter's declaration echoes the responses of biblical figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), who answered God's call with readiness and obedience. This phrase indicates Peter's acceptance of God's unfolding plan, even as it challenges Jewish customs. It underscores the theme of divine calling and human response, a recurring motif in Scripture.<p><b>the one you are looking for.</b><br>Peter acknowledges his role in God's plan, recognizing that the men were sent by Cornelius, a Roman centurion. This moment marks a significant step in the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as Peter is about to receive a vision that will redefine the early church's understanding of clean and unclean (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>). It foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, fulfilling prophecies of a universal gospel (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>Why have you come?&#8221;</b><br>Peter's question invites dialogue and understanding, reflecting a shift from suspicion to openness. It demonstrates the importance of discernment and inquiry in spiritual matters. This inquiry sets the stage for the revelation that God's salvation is for all people, a theme that Paul later expands upon in his epistles (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>). The question also highlights the necessity of seeking God's purpose in unexpected encounters, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, a key leader in the early Christian church.

Go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19-20</a>). Peter&#8217;s descent from the rooftop is immediate obedience, like Philip&#8217;s swift response in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-27</a>.<p>&#8226; His movement signals readiness to act on divine direction, echoing Abraham&#8217;s promptness in <a href="/genesis/24-58.htm">Genesis 24:58</a> when Rebekah said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the men</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;men&#8221; are Gentile messengers from Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1-8</a>). By moving toward them, Peter steps across entrenched Jewish-Gentile boundaries, foreshadowing <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a> where Christ &#8220;has made both one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus modeled similar barrier-breaking when He spoke with the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). Peter now follows that pattern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; Peter initiates conversation&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t wait for the visitors to speak first. Scripture commends gracious, proactive speech: &#8220;A man finds joy in an apt reply&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>) and &#8220;Let your speech always be with grace&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Speaking first also shows leadership and hospitality, crucial qualities for the soon-to-be missionary to the Gentiles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Here am I&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; These words mirror the heart-response of servants like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). Peter identifies himself with availability and humility.<p>&#8226; It signals personal accountability; Peter doesn&#8217;t hide behind titles or status&#8212;he presents himself plainly, just as Paul later does in <a href="/acts/21-39.htm">Acts 21:39</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;the one you are looking for.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Peter affirms his identity, removing uncertainty. Jesus did likewise in Gethsemane: &#8220;I am He&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Transparency invites trust; Ananias demonstrated the same clarity when he sought Saul (<a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10-12</a>). Peter&#8217;s openness prepares the way for Gospel witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why have you come?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Though the Spirit has revealed the broad purpose, Peter still asks. Listening first is wise: &#8220;Let every man be swift to hear&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The question invites testimony. Cornelius&#8217;s men will recount their vision (<a href="/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>), providing an opportunity similar to the Ethiopian&#8217;s inquiry in <a href="/acts/8-34.htm">Acts 8:34</a>.<p>&#8226; Asking also models <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>&#8212;creating space for others to &#8220;give the reason for the hope.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-21.htm">Acts 10:21</a> captures Peter&#8217;s Spirit-led obedience, his willingness to bridge cultural divides, his transparent self-identification, and his invitational listening.
