In biblical narratives, immediate actions often underscore the seriousness of the offense and the direct intervention of God. This immediacy highlights the urgency and severity of Herod's sin.<p><b>because Herod did not give glory to God</b><br>Herod Agrippa I, a ruler known for his political acumen, failed to acknowledge God as the source of his power. This echoes the biblical principle that all authority is derived from God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Herod's acceptance of divine praise from the people (<a href="/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>) without redirecting it to God parallels the sin of pride seen in other biblical figures, such as Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30-32</a>.<p><b>an angel of the Lord struck him down</b><br>Angels are often depicted as messengers and agents of God's will throughout Scripture. The angel's role here is one of executing divine judgment, similar to the angel of death in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. This act serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the reality of divine retribution.<p><b>and he was eaten by worms and died</b><br>This gruesome detail emphasizes the completeness of Herod's judgment. The phrase "eaten by worms" may suggest a supernatural affliction, reflecting the severity of divine punishment. Historically, Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian, corroborates this account, describing Herod's death as a prolonged and painful ordeal. This serves as a stark warning against pride and the refusal to honor God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king of Judea, known for his persecution of the early church.

The form of the disease, probably of the nature of <span class= "ital">phtheiriasis, </span>or the <span class= "ital">morbus pedicularis, </span>from its exceptionally loathsome character, had always been regarded as of the nature of a divine chastisement. The more memorable instances of it recorded in history are those of Pheretimo of Cyrene (Herod. iv. 205), Sylla, Antiochus the Great (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-2.htm" title="For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame.">2 Maccabees 9:2</a>), Herod the Great (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 8), and Maximinus, among the persecutors of the Church (Euseb. viii. 16; ix. 10, 11; Lactant, <span class= "ital">De mort.
