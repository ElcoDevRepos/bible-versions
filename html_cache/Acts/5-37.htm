He emerged after Theudas, another insurrectionist, as noted in the preceding verse. Judas is known for leading a revolt against the Roman census, which was seen as a symbol of subjugation and taxation. His appearance marks a period of heightened Jewish nationalism and unrest. This reflects the broader socio-political climate of first-century Judea, where messianic expectations and anti-Roman sentiments were prevalent.<p><b>in the days of the census</b><br>The census referred to here is likely the one conducted under Quirinius, the Roman governor of Syria, around 6 AD. This census was for the purpose of taxation and was deeply resented by the Jewish population, as it symbolized Roman oppression and control. The census is also mentioned in <a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2:1-3</a>, which provides context for the birth of Jesus. The resistance to the census by Judas the Galilean highlights the tension between Jewish autonomy and Roman authority.<p><b>and drew away people after him</b><br>Judas the Galilean's ability to draw followers indicates his influence and the appeal of his message, which likely centered on Jewish independence and opposition to Roman rule. This phrase underscores the recurring theme of charismatic leaders in Jewish history who sought to rally the people against foreign domination. It also serves as a cautionary example of how such movements, not ordained by God, ultimately fail.<p><b>He too perished</b><br>The demise of Judas the Galilean serves as a reminder of the futility of human-led insurrections against divinely permitted authorities. His death signifies the end of his movement and the temporary nature of earthly power. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns of the downfall that follows pride and rebellion against God's established order.<p><b>and all his followers were scattered</b><br>The scattering of Judas's followers illustrates the disintegration of movements not founded on God's truth. This dispersion is reminiscent of the fate of other rebellious groups throughout biblical history, such as the followers of Korah in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. It also foreshadows the scattering of the Jewish people after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. This scattering serves as a contrast to the enduring and unifying power of the Gospel, which gathers believers from all nations into one body in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_the_galilean.htm">Judas the Galilean</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who led a revolt against Roman taxation during the time of the census.

His emergence illustrates Jesus&#8217; warning that &#8220;many will come in My name, saying, &#8216;I am He,&#8217; and will mislead many&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-6.htm">Mark 13:6</a>).

Taxes and loyalty oaths stirred nationalistic anger, providing Judas a platform.

Therefore, if the apostles&#8217; ministry is of God, opposing it would mean fighting against Him (<a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38-39</a>); if it is merely human, it will fail just as Judas&#8217; revolt did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Judas of Galilee.</span>--In one passage Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 1) calls him a Gaulonite--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the country east of Galilee. Had this stood alone, St. Luke might have been charged here also with inaccuracy; but in other passages (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 5, ? 2; <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 8, ? 1) he is described as a Galilean. On the taxing, in the modern sense of the term, which followed on the census that synchronised with our Lord's nativity, both being conducted under the supervision of Quirinus, see Notes on <a href="/context/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1-2</a>. The insurrection of Judas was by far the most important of the attempts to throw off the yoke of Rome. He was assisted by a Pharisee, named Sadduk, and the absolute independence of Israel was the watchword of his followers. It was unlawful, in any form, to pay tribute to Caesar. It was lawful to use any weapons in defence of freedom. The war they waged was a religious war; and Josephus, writing long after the movement had collapsed, but giving, obviously, the impressions of his own early manhood, enumerates them as being with the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, with the first of whom they were very closely allied--one of the four great religious sects of Judaism. Roman procurators and princes, like Archelaus and Antipas, were naturally united against him, and he and his followers came to the end of which Gamaliel speaks. His influence over the excitable population of Galilee was, however, at the time great, and in part survived. One of the Apostles probably derived his name of <span class= "ital">Zelotes, </span>or <span class= "ital">Cananite</span> (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>), from having been among the followers of Judas, who were known by that name. His sons, Jacob and Simon, continued to be looked on as leaders after his death, and were crucified under Tiberius Alexander, the successor of Fadus in the procuratorship (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 5, ?2).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37</span> <span class="accented">- Enrolment</span> for <span class="accented">taxing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">some of the</span> for <span class="accented">much</span>, A.V.; as many for <span class="accented">even as many</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">scattered abroad</span> for <span class="accented">dispersed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Judas of Galilee</span>, otherwise called the <span class="accented">Gaulonite</span>, as a native of Gamala, in Gaulonitis.

He was the great leader of the Jews in opposing the census ordered by Augustus, after the deposition of Archelaus, and carried out by Cyrenius, or rather P. Sulpicius Quirinus, the Propraetor of Syria, with the assistance of Cumanus, the subordinate Governor of Judaea. Judas, with Zadoc his coadjutor, was the founder of a fourth Jewish sect, nearly allied to the Pharisees, and his sedition was founded on his philosophic tenets. Josephus speaks of him as the author of all the seditions, tumults, slaughters, sieges, devastations, plunder, famines, ending with the burning of the temple, which afflicted his unhappy country. He gives no account of his death. But his two sons, James and Simon, were crucified by Tiberius Alexander, the successor of Cuspius Fadus. Another son, Menahem, having collected and armed a large band of robbers and other insurgents, after a partially successful attack on the Roman camp at Jerusalem, was miserably slain. The enrolment (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, as <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>). The purpose of Augustus, which had been delayed some years from causes not accurately known, perhaps in deference to some remonstrance from Herod the Great, was now carried into effect. Quirinus was sent, apparently the second time, as Proprsetor of Syria, to which Judaea was now attached, with Cumanus under him as Procurator of Judaea, to make a valuation of all their property. The Jews had been first persuaded by the high priest Joazar, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apparently in the end of Herod's reign, or the beginning of Archelaus's, to submit to what they greatly disliked, but were now roused to insurrection by Judas of Galilee ('Ant.,' 18, 1:1). <span class="cmt_word">He also perished</span>. Nothing is known of his death beyond this notice of it. Scattered abroad. Not crushed, for the insurrection broke out again and again, having the character of a religious war given to it by Judas of Galilee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[him],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(touton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Judas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#959;&#973;&#948;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ioudas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2455.htm">Strong's 2455: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Judas, the name of ten Israelites; also of the posterity of one of them and its region.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
