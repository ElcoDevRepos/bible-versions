Felix's decision to wait for the accusers reflects Roman legal practices, which required the presence of both parties for a fair trial. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which emphasizes the need for multiple witnesses. Felix's statement also highlights the tension between Roman law and Jewish customs, as Paul, a Roman citizen, is entitled to certain legal protections. This moment underscores the providence of God in using Roman legal systems to protect Paul and further the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod&#8217;s Praetorium.</b><br>Herod&#8217;s Praetorium, also known as Herod's palace, was a grand structure in Caesarea Maritima, built by Herod the Great. It served as the official residence of the Roman governors. Archaeological findings confirm its opulence and strategic location, symbolizing Roman authority. Paul's confinement here, rather than in a common prison, indicates a level of respect for his Roman citizenship. This setting also provided Paul with opportunities to witness to influential figures, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> that Paul would testify before kings. The Praetorium's role as a place of judgment and governance parallels Christ's own trial before Pilate, drawing a typological connection between Paul and Jesus as both faced unjust accusations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is under Roman custody due to accusations from Jewish leaders.

Felix responds to the military commander&#8217;s letter (<a href="/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26&#8211;33</a>) with measured, official language, a hallmark of Roman procedure seen earlier when Gallio spoke in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-14.htm">Acts 18:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement shows governmental authority recognizing Paul&#8217;s legal standing as a Roman citizen (<a href="/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25&#8211;29</a>), reminding us of God&#8217;s promise that Paul would testify before rulers (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Pilate who found &#8220;no basis for a charge&#8221; against Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>), Felix begins by signaling an intent to judge facts, not mob pressure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Awaiting the Accusers</b><p>&#8220;I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Roman justice required the plaintiffs to be present; Scripture likewise insists on witnesses before judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By deferring the hearing, Felix affirms due process, contrasting with the Sanhedrin&#8217;s earlier plot to murder Paul en route (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses secular courts to slow hostile plans, echoing <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>: &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s calm submission models respect for authority even when the system is imperfect (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Protective Custody</b><p>&#8220;Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; What looks like confinement actually shields Paul from assassination (<a href="/acts/23-23.htm">Acts 23:23&#8211;24, 30</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar protective detentions appear when Roman soldiers rescued him from the temple riot (<a href="/acts/21-32.htm">Acts 21:32&#8211;34</a>) and when he reached Rome (<a href="/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God often hides His servants in plain sight&#8212;think of Elijah sustained in the Kerith ravine (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The guard also guarantees Paul&#8217;s future audience with Felix, Festus, Agrippa, and ultimately Caesar (<a href="/bsb/acts/24.htm">Acts 24&#8211;26</a>; 27:24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Herod&#8217;s Praetorium</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in Herod&#8217;s Praetorium.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This palace, built by Herod the Great at Caesarea, doubled as the governor&#8217;s residence and headquarters&#8212;much like the praetorium where Jesus stood before Pilate (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28, 33</a>; 19:9, 13).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s placement in a royal setting fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise that the gospel would reach &#8220;kings&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Later Paul writes that his chains became &#8220;known throughout the whole palace guard&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-13.htm">Philippians 1:13</a>), showing how confinement turned into a platform.<p>&#8226; Even architecture bows to providence: a stone fortress becomes a pulpit for the apostle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/23-35.htm">Acts 23:35</a> records a divinely guided pause. Felix&#8217;s formal reply upholds Roman due process, ensuring that accusers must appear. The governor&#8217;s order for guarded lodging, far from thwarting ministry, preserves Paul&#8217;s life and positions him inside Herod&#8217;s luxurious praetorium&#8212;a strategic launchpad for witness to rulers and soldiers alike. God&#8217;s sovereignty turns legal protocol into protective grace, moving His servant steadily toward Rome just as He promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">I will hear thee.</span>--The Greek verb expresses the idea of a thorough hearing.<p><span class= "bld">He commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</span>--The Greek word is <span class= "ital">praetorium, </span>a word somewhat elastic in its application, and ranging from a palace to a barrack. "Judgment hall" hardly gives the meaning here. The building had probably been intended by Herod for use as a royal residence, and was now used by the Roman procurator for himself and his troops. The Apostle had there a second experience of the life of a praetorium. At Rome he does not appear to have been in the praetorium, though the circumstances of his imprisonment brought him into contact with the soldiers who were quartered there. (Comp.
