It signifies a moment of submission and recognition of Jesus' authority. Saul's question echoes the humility and willingness to obey, reminiscent of Isaiah's response in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>, "Here am I. Send me!" It marks a pivotal transformation from persecutor to disciple, highlighting the theme of divine calling and human response.<p><b>&#8216;Get up and go into Damascus,&#8217; He told me.</b><br>Damascus, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities, was a significant center for trade and culture in the ancient world. Saul's journey to Damascus, initially intended for persecution, becomes a journey of obedience and transformation. This command to "get up and go" parallels other biblical calls to action, such as Abraham's call to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and Jonah's call to go to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>). It underscores the necessity of movement and obedience in the life of faith.<p><b>&#8216;There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates that Saul's mission is divinely orchestrated, with specific tasks prepared for him. The use of "appointed" suggests predestination and divine purpose, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, which speaks of believers being created for good works prepared in advance. It also foreshadows Saul's future role as the Apostle Paul, a chosen instrument to spread the Gospel to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This divine appointment emphasizes God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through chosen individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Paul is recounting his conversion experience on the road to Damascus.

Like the psalmist who prays, &#8220;Teach me Your ways, O LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4&#8211;5</a>), Saul submits his will to God&#8217;s direction.<p>&#8226; Genuine conversion always moves from conviction to surrender. Compare <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, where the crowd asks, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221; The pattern is clear: when God reveals Himself, our first move is to seek His marching orders.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a> reminds us to trust and acknowledge the Lord; He then &#8220;will make your paths straight.&#8221; Saul models that trust here, setting aside personal plans for God&#8217;s purpose.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> assures that God &#8220;gives generously to all who ask.&#8221; Saul&#8217;s question positions him to receive clear guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Get up and go into Damascus,&#8217; He told me</b><p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s command is specific and practical&#8212;&#8220;Get up&#8230;go.&#8221; True faith acts (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience often involves a simple first step before fuller revelation comes. Abraham left Ur without the full itinerary (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). The Israelites stepped into the Jordan before it parted (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>). Likewise, Saul must enter the very city where he intended harm, demonstrating repentance in action (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4&#8211;6</a> shows Peter obeying Jesus&#8217; directive to cast the nets again, leading to abundance. Obedience precedes understanding and blessing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a> records Paul later testifying, &#8220;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&#8221; underscoring that his lifelong ministry began with this simple act of compliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;appointed&#8221; reveals divine sovereignty; Saul&#8217;s ministry was prepared in advance, echoing <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>.<p>&#8226; Guidance unfolds progressively. In Damascus, Saul will meet Ananias (<a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10&#8211;17</a>) who confirms the call, a reminder that God often uses His people to clarify our assignments.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4&#8211;8</a> illustrates how each believer has a distinct role within the body of Christ. Saul&#8217;s appointment includes suffering for Jesus&#8217; name (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15&#8211;16</a>) and carrying the gospel to Gentiles, kings, and Israel.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a> highlights that God &#8220;called us&#8230;according to His own purpose and grace,&#8221; affirming that His plan for Saul&#8212;and for us&#8212;rests on grace, not merit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-10.htm">Acts 22:10</a> captures the moment Saul moves from rebellion to surrender. He asks, &#8220;What should I do, Lord?&#8221;&#8212;a question every believer must echo. The Lord answers with a clear next step&#8212;&#8220;Get up and go&#8221;&#8212;demonstrating that obedience precedes fuller revelation. Finally, Saul learns that God has already &#8220;appointed&#8221; his mission, showcasing divine sovereignty and purposeful calling. When we, like Saul, submit, obey, and trust God&#8217;s unfolding plan, we step into the works He prepared for us from the foundation of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I asked,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
