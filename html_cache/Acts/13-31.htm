After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples and others over a period of 40 days (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>). These appearances served to confirm His resurrection and to provide further teaching and instruction to His followers. The number 40 is significant in the Bible, often associated with periods of testing, trial, and preparation (e.g., the 40 days of rain during the flood, Israel's 40 years in the wilderness, and Jesus' 40 days of fasting).<p><b>by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem.</b><br>This group primarily includes the apostles and other close followers of Jesus who had been with Him throughout His ministry. Galilee was the region where Jesus began His public ministry, and many of His disciples were called from there. The journey from Galilee to Jerusalem is significant as it represents the path of Jesus' ministry leading to His crucifixion and resurrection. This journey also fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant who would be rejected and killed in Jerusalem (Isaiah 53).<p><b>They are now His witnesses</b><br>The term "witnesses" is crucial in the context of the early church. The apostles and other followers were eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, which gave them authority to testify about Him. This role of being a witness is emphasized in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus commissions His disciples to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." The Greek word for witness, "martys," is also the root for the word "martyr," indicating the seriousness and potential cost of this testimony.<p><b>to our people.</b><br>This phrase indicates the initial focus of the apostles' witness: the Jewish people. The early Christian message was first proclaimed to the Jews, as they were the people of the covenant and the recipients of the promises of God (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). This aligns with the pattern seen throughout Acts, where the apostles often began their preaching in synagogues. However, the message was not limited to the Jews, as the gospel was intended for all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all peoples on earth would be blessed through his offspring (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose resurrection is being testified by His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Those who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem and had seen Him after His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus began His ministry and where many of His followers originated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected, and where the early church began.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>The apostles who are recounting this testimony in the synagogue in Pisidian Antioch.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_eyewitness_testimony.htm">The Importance of Eyewitness Testimony</a></b><br>The credibility of the resurrection is supported by those who personally witnessed the risen Christ.

St. Paul thus confirms the statement in <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a> (see note to <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Galilee to Jerusalem</span>. Who are meant? and what ascent from Galilee to Jerusalem is here intended? The answer to the first question is, the eleven apostles, whose special office it was to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>, note). The answer to the second is, that the ascent from Galilee, where most of our Lord's appearances took place, to Jerusalem, shortly before the Ascension, is here intended, and that this passage is a distinct recognition by St. Luke of the Galilaean appearances. There is, as is well known, great obscurity, and apparent discrepancies in the accounts of our Lord's appearances after the Resurrection. St. Matthew seems to place them exclusively in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7, 10, 16</a>). St. Mark likewise (16: 7); but in the section 9-20 he mentions the appearance to Mary Magdalene and to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, but gives no clue as to where the appearance to the eleven took place. St. Luke seems to place them exclusively in Judaea, but very curiously puts a mention of Galilee in the angel's mouth in the very place where, according to St. Matthew, he announced the Lord's appearance in Galilee. St. John, again places the three first appearances in Jerusalem (<a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>.), but describes at length a third as having taken place in Galilee (<a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2, 14</a>). St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) speaks of an appearance to five hundred brethren at once, which in all probability took place in Galilee, as only a hundred and twenty names were numbered at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). It is, therefore, satisfactory to have this confirmation of the residence of the apostles in Galilee between the Resurrection and the Ascension in St. Luke's report of St. Paul's speech.
