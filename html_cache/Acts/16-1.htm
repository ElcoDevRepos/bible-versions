Paul had previously visited these cities during his first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/14-6.htm">Acts 14:6-21</a>). Lystra is notable for being the place where Paul healed a man lame from birth, which led to the locals attempting to offer sacrifices to him and Barnabas, mistaking them for gods (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8-13</a>). This visit marks the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey, where he revisits the churches he established to strengthen and encourage them (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>). The region was known for its diverse population, including Jews and Gentiles, which is significant for the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>where he found a disciple named Timothy</b><br>Timothy is introduced here as a disciple, indicating he was already a follower of Christ when Paul met him. Timothy would become one of Paul's closest companions and a significant figure in the early church. He is mentioned in several of Paul's letters, including two addressed directly to him (1 Timothy and 2 Timothy). Timothy's role as a disciple highlights the importance of mentorship and discipleship in the early church, as Paul would later entrust him with leadership responsibilities (<a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>).<p><b>the son of a believing Jewish woman and a Greek father</b><br>Timothy's mixed heritage is significant. His mother, Eunice, is described as a believing Jew, indicating she was a Jewish Christian. This reflects the early church's composition, which included both Jews and Gentiles. Timothy's father being Greek suggests he was a Gentile, which may have influenced Timothy's upbringing and understanding of both Jewish and Greek cultures. This dual heritage would have been advantageous in Timothy's ministry, allowing him to bridge cultural gaps. Timothy's mother and grandmother, Lois, are noted for their sincere faith, which they passed on to him (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), emphasizing the role of family in spiritual formation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and missionary who played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity among the Gentiles.

Returning shows Paul&#8217;s pastoral heart: he revisits fledgling churches to strengthen and encourage them (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;what He begins, He completes (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). Paul models that mindset by circling back to ensure spiritual growth.<p>&#8226; Derbe was a frontier town of the Roman province of Galatia, reminding us that the gospel flourishes in unlikely places (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and then to Lystra</b><p>&#8226; Lystra is loaded with memories. Here Paul healed a cripple (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8-10</a>), was mistaken for a god (14:11-13), and then stoned and left for dead (14:19). His return illustrates fearless obedience (<a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By revisiting the very city where he nearly died, Paul demonstrates that past opposition never overrides present calling (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The believers in Lystra would have been strengthened by seeing Paul alive and eager to minister&#8212;living proof of resurrection power at work (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he found a disciple named Timothy</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Disciple&#8221; tells us Timothy was already committed to Christ, likely converted during Paul&#8217;s first visit (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The local churches &#8220;spoke well of him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-2.htm">Acts 16:2</a>), highlighting observable fruit in Timothy&#8217;s life. Character precedes commissioning.<p>&#8226; Paul soon calls him &#8220;my true child in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>) and &#8220;like-minded&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-22</a>). God often pairs seasoned believers with younger servants to multiply ministry (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Timothy becomes an illustration of faithful succession: from Paul to Timothy to &#8220;reliable men,&#8221; the gospel keeps advancing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of a believing Jewish woman</b><p>&#8226; Timothy&#8217;s mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois, passed on &#8220;sincere faith&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; From childhood he had known the &#8220;sacred Scriptures&#8221; that lead to salvation (<a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors the spiritual investment of parents and grandparents. When one household member believes, the ripple can shape generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>; <a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Timothy&#8217;s Jewish heritage also prepared him for ministry among Jews; he could enter synagogues with credibility after Paul circumcised him (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a Greek father</b><p>&#8226; Luke notes the father&#8217;s ethnicity without calling him &#8220;believing,&#8221; implying he was a Gentile and likely not a follower of Christ.<p>&#8226; Timothy&#8217;s mixed background positioned him as a bridge between cultures&#8212;uniquely suited for the Jew-first, Gentile-also strategy (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later writes, &#8220;To the Jews I became like a Jew&#8230;to those without the law, like one without the law&#8230;so that I might save some&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</a>).

The verse invites us to trust the Lord&#8217;s orchestration of places, people, and past experiences as He builds His church&#8212;one city, one household, one disciple at a time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XVI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">A certain disciple was there, named Timotheus.</span>--We read with a special interest the first mention of the name of one who was afterwards so dear to the Apostle, his "true son in the faith" (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm" title="To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.">1Timothy 1:2</a>).

The way in which St. Paul writes to him, and of him, implies a constitution naturally not strong, and, in after life, weakened by a rigorous asceticism (<a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a>), emotional even to tears (<a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), naturally shrinking from hardships and responsibilities, yet facing them in the strength of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>).

Its meaning ("one who honours God") made it a suitable name for the child of a proselyte. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- And he came also</span> for <span class="accented">then came he</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">to Lystra</span> for <span class="accented">Lystra</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of a Jewess</span> for <span class="accented">of a certain woman which was a Jewess</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">which</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.

It is a Greek name, meaning "one who honors God" (formed, like <span class="accented">Timoleon, Timolaus, Timocrates</span>, etc.). It was a not uncommon name, and occurs repeatedly in the Books of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6; 2 Macc. 8:30, etc.). Another form is <span class="accented">Timesitheos.</span> Timothy is uniformly spoken of by St. Paul in terms of eulogy and warm affection (see, besides the passages above quoted, <a href="/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-22</a>; and the general tone of the Epistles to Timothy). <span class="cmt_word">A Jewess</span>; viz. <span class="accented">Eunice</span> (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), also a Greek name (equivalent to <span class="accented">Victoria</span>), though borne by a Jewess. <span class="cmt_word">A Greek</span>; i.e. <span class="accented">a</span> Gentile (see Hark 7:26; <a href="/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>, etc.; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>).
