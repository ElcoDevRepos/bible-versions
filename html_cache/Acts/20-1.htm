The uproar signifies the intense spiritual and social conflict that often accompanied the spread of the Gospel. Ephesus was a major center of commerce and religion, and the disturbance highlights the transformative impact of Christianity on established pagan practices.<p><b>Paul sent for the disciples</b><br>Paul's action of sending for the disciples demonstrates his role as a leader and shepherd to the early Christian community. The term "disciples" refers to the followers of Jesus who were being taught and mentored by Paul. This reflects the early church's structure, where apostles and leaders provided guidance and instruction to new believers. It also shows Paul's concern for their well-being and spiritual growth, especially after the recent turmoil.<p><b>And after encouraging them</b><br>Encouragement was a vital part of Paul's ministry, as seen throughout his epistles. The Greek word used here, "parakaleo," can mean to exhort, comfort, or strengthen. Paul often encouraged believers to remain steadfast in their faith amidst persecution and trials. This encouragement would have been crucial for the disciples in Ephesus, who faced opposition from both religious and economic forces.<p><b>he said goodbye to them</b><br>Paul's farewell indicates a transition in his missionary journey. His goodbyes were often emotional, as seen in <a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37-38</a>, where he later bids farewell to the Ephesian elders with tears. This reflects the deep bonds formed within the early Christian communities and the personal sacrifices made by Paul and others in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>and left for Macedonia</b><br>Macedonia was a significant region in Paul's missionary work, including cities like Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. His journey to Macedonia was part of his broader mission to strengthen existing churches and spread the Gospel further. This movement also aligns with the strategic approach Paul took in his missions, focusing on key urban centers to maximize the reach of his ministry. The journey to Macedonia is a continuation of the fulfillment of the Great Commission, as Paul sought to make disciples of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who played a significant role in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.

Having sent Timotheus and Erastus to see after the discipline of the Church of Corinth (<a href="/acts/19-17.htm" title="And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.">Acts 19:17</a>), the Apostle was cheered by the coming of Stephanas and his two companions (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" title="I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.">1Corinthians 16:17</a>), and apparently wrote by them what is now the First Epistle to the Corinthians. A previous Epistle had been sent, probably by Timothy, to which he refers in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>. When he wrote that Epistle he intended to press on quickly and complete in person the work which it was to begin (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.">1Corinthians 4:18-19</a>). He was led, however, to change his purpose, and to take the land journey through Macedonia instead of going by sea to Corinth (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2Corinthians 1:16-17</a>), and so from Corinth to Macedonia, as he had at first intended. He was anxious to know the effect of his letter before he took any further action, and Titus, who probably accompanied the bearers of that letter, was charged to hasten back to Troas with his report. On coming to Troas, however, he did not find him, and after waiting for some time in vain (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>), the anxiety told upon his health. He despaired of life and felt as if the sentence of death was passed on him (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:">2Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>). The mysterious thorn in the flesh "buffeted" him with more severity than ever (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). He pressed on, however, to Macedonia (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2Corinthians 2:13</a>), probably to Philippi, as being the first of the churches he had planted, where he would find loving friends and the "beloved physician," whose services he now needed more than ever. There, or elsewhere in Macedonia, Titus joined him, and brought tidings that partly cheered him, partly roused his indignation. There had been repentance and reformation where he most wished to see them, on the one hand (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2Corinthians 6:6-12</a>); on the other, his enemies said bitter things of him, sneered at his bodily infirmities (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2Corinthians 10:10</a>), and compared, to his disparagement, the credentials which Apollos had presented (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>) with his lack of them. The result was that Titus was sent back with the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, accompanied by some other disciple (probably St. Luke, but see Notes on <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18-19</a>), the Apostle resolving to wait till they had brought matters into better order and had collected what had been laid up in store for the Church of Jerusalem, so that it might be ready for him on his arrival (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.">2Corinthians 9:5</a>). At or about this time also, to judge from the numerous parallelisms of thought and language between it and the Epistles to the Corinthians on the one hand, and that to the Romans on the other, we must place the date of the Epistle to the Galatians. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> to that Epistle.) Probably after Titus and Luke had left, and before Timotheus had returned--when he was alone, with no one to share the labour of writing, or to give help and counsel--tidings came that the Judaising teachers had been there also, and had been only too successful. How the tidings reached him we do not know, but if the purple-seller of Thyatira was still at Philippi, she might naturally be in receipt of communications from that city, and it was near enough to Galatia to know what was passing there. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Having sent for</span>... <span class="accented">and exhorted</span> for <span class="accented">called unto him</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">took leave of them, and departed</span> for <span class="accented">and embraced them, and departed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Departed for to go into Macedonia</span>. This was St. Paul's purpose, as he had written to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>) from Ephesus. He judged it wise, not only with a view to his own safety and that of his companions, but also for the rest and quiet of the Ephesian Church, to take advantage of the lull in the popular storm, and withdraw into quiet waters before any fresh outbreak occurred. Aquila and Priscilla seem to have left Ephesus about the same time, or soon after, since the Epistle to the Romans found them again at Rome (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>); and, if the view mentioned in the note to <a href="/acts/19-40.htm">Acts 19:40</a> is true - that in the riot they had saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own - there were probably the same prudential motives for their leaving Ephesus as there were in the case of the apostle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
