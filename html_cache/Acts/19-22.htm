Erastus, though less frequently mentioned, is noted in <a href="/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a> as the city treasurer, indicating his possible influence and status. The sending of these two helpers underscores the importance of teamwork and delegation in ministry, reflecting the body of Christ working together with different gifts and roles (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>to Macedonia</b><br>Macedonia was a significant region in the early Christian mission, with cities like Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea being key locations where Paul established churches (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-12, 17</a>:1-10). The Macedonian churches were known for their generosity despite their poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>), and Paul had a deep affection for them. This mission to Macedonia reflects the ongoing commitment to nurture and support these early Christian communities.<p><b>while he stayed for a time in the province of Asia</b><br>The province of Asia, particularly the city of Ephesus, was a major center for Paul's ministry. Ephesus was a bustling city known for the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and a hub of commerce and culture. Paul's extended stay in Asia allowed him to establish a strong church presence and engage in significant teaching and miracles (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-10</a>). This period was crucial for spreading the Gospel throughout the region, as Ephesus served as a strategic base for reaching the surrounding areas.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is orchestrating the missionary journey and sending his helpers to Macedonia.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young disciple and trusted companion of Paul, known for his faith and leadership in the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/erastus.htm">Erastus</a></b><br>A lesser-known companion of Paul, possibly the city treasurer of Corinth, indicating his significant role.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>A region in Northern Greece where Paul had previously established churches and was sending Timothy and Erastus to support and strengthen the believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/province_of_asia.htm">Province of Asia</a></b><br>A Roman province in what is now modern-day Turkey, where Paul decided to remain for a while longer, likely to continue his ministry work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_delegation_in_ministry.htm">The Importance of Delegation in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s decision to send Timothy and Erastus highlights the necessity of trusting others with responsibilities in ministry.

The verse pictures a unified team, purposeful timing, and Spirit-led geography&#8212;all working together to spread Christ&#8217;s message without delay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Timotheus and Erastus.</span>--Light is thrown on the mission of the former by <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>. He was sent on in advance to warn and exhort, and so to save the Apostle from the necessity of using severity when he himself arrived. St. Paul exhorts the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>) to receive him with respect, so that he might not feel that his youth detracted from his authority. He was to return to St. Paul, and was accordingly with him when he wrote the Second Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>). Erastus may fairly be identified with the chamberlain or steward of Corinth of <a href="/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>, and was chosen probably as the companion of Timotheus because his office would carry weight with it. Sosthenes, who was with St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1Corinthians 1:1</a>), had probably been staying some time at Ephesus, and as having been ruler of the synagogue, was naturally coupled by the Apostle with himself, as a mark of respect and confidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- And having sent</span> for <span class="accented">so he sent</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he</span> for <span class="accented">but he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">while</span> for <span class="accented">season</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Two of them</span>, etc. Erastus is here mentioned for the first time. If he is the same person who is mentioned in <a href="/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>, it is probable that he was one of St. Paul's Corinthian converts who had gone with him from Corinth to Jerusalem and Antioch, and had accompanied him through Phrygia and Galatia to Ephesus. Silos, who had been Timothy's companion on the former visit to Macedonia, seems to have left St. Paul, possibly at Jerusalem, from whence he originally came (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32, 34</a>), and to have attached himself to Peter (<a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Perhaps he was especially connected with the mission to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, etc., as it appears from the passage just quoted that he was "a faithful brother unto them," A.V.; "or our faithful brother," R.V. <span class="cmt_word">He himself stayed</span>, etc. This phrase is in singular harmony with <a href="/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>, which seems clearly to have been written after Timothy's departure for Macedonia and before his arrival at Corinth, since Timothy is not mentioned either in the superscription or among the salutations (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19, 20</a>), and his coming to Corinth is spoken of as doubtful, though probable, in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. Both passages imply a prolongation of Paul's stay at Ephesus beyond his original intention. The special reason for this prolongation of his sojourn at Ephesus, and which is alluded to in 1 Car 16:9, is thought to be the Artemisian or Ephesian games, which were celebrated at Ephesus in May - and therefore just at this time - and which brought a vast concourse of Ionians to Ephesus. It was at this time, doubtless, that the principal sale of "silver shrines of Diana" took place, and therefore it was natural that Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen should be very angry when they found their usual gains were cut short by the multitude of converts all over Proconsular Asia. We learn from <a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a> that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus had arrived at Ephesus from Corinth. It is likely that their presence, together with that of Tychicus and Trophimus, two Asiatic converts, enabled St. Paul to dispense with the services of Time-thy and Erastus for a time. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, kept himself back, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stayed; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a while, an indefinite phrase, but indicating a short time.
