This is significant because it underscores the nature of faith and trust in God's promises, even when immediate evidence is lacking. Abraham's lack of physical inheritance is a reminder of the spiritual nature of God's promises, which often transcend immediate physical realities. This is consistent with <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-10</a>, where Abraham is commended for his faith, living as a foreigner in the promised land, looking forward to a city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.<p><b>But God promised to give possession of the land to Abraham and his descendants,</b><br>This promise is foundational to the Abrahamic Covenant, first articulated in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> and reiterated in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>. The promise of land was central to God's covenant with Abraham, symbolizing a place of blessing and a future hope for his descendants. This promise was not fulfilled in Abraham's lifetime but was realized through his descendants, particularly during the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. The land promise also has eschatological implications, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).<p><b>even though he did not yet have a child.</b><br>This highlights the miraculous nature of God's promise, as Abraham and Sarah were childless and advanced in age when the promise was given (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>). The birth of Isaac, the child of promise, was a testament to God's faithfulness and power to fulfill His word against all odds. This aspect of the promise underscores the theme of faith and reliance on God's timing and provision. It also prefigures the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises, who was born to a virgin, emphasizing God's sovereign ability to bring about His purposes in unexpected ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God made promises regarding land and descendants.
