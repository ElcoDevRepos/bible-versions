The directive to "get up" is both literal and symbolic, indicating a call to action and a new direction. It echoes the call of other biblical figures who were summoned to rise and follow God's will, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>).<p><b>and go into the city</b><br>The city referred to is Damascus, a significant location in early Christian history. Damascus was a major cultural and commercial center in the ancient Near East, known for its diverse population and strategic location. Saul's journey to Damascus was initially intended to persecute Christians, but it becomes the place of his conversion and commissioning. This mirrors the journeys of other biblical figures who encountered God in unexpected places, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>).<p><b>and you will be told</b><br>This phrase indicates that Saul's future actions will be guided by divine instruction. It emphasizes the theme of obedience and submission to God's will, a recurring motif in Scripture. Saul's reliance on further revelation highlights the importance of faith and trust in God's plan, similar to how the Israelites depended on God's guidance during their journey to the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><b>what you must do</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the idea of divine purpose and mission. Saul's calling is not just personal but is part of a larger divine plan for the spread of the Gospel. It foreshadows his role as the Apostle to the Gentiles, as outlined in <a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a> and <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>. This aligns with the prophetic vision of the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's salvation plan, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. Saul's transformation and mission serve as a type of Christ, who also received a divine commission to fulfill God's redemptive work (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee who persecuted Christians, later becoming the Apostle Paul after his conversion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who appears to Saul on the road to Damascus, initiating Saul's conversion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The city Saul was traveling to in order to arrest Christians, but it becomes the place of his transformation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_damascus.htm">The Road to Damascus</a></b><br>The location of Saul's dramatic encounter with Jesus, leading to his conversion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A disciple in Damascus who is later instructed by the Lord to visit Saul and restore his sight.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Saul's immediate response to Jesus' command demonstrates the importance of obedience in the Christian life.

God&#8217;s voice propels Saul from persecutor to disciple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go into the city</b><p>&#8226; Damascus becomes the classroom where Saul will learn the gospel he once opposed. God often sends us back into the flow of ordinary life (<a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>) to demonstrate transformed hearts.<p>&#8226; Like Jonah&#8217;s redirected journey to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2</a>) or Philip&#8217;s road to Gaza (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>), the instruction is precise: location matters in God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; The city represents people&#8212;Ananias, believers, future converts&#8212;showing God&#8217;s heart to reach communities, not just individuals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will be told</b><p>&#8226; Guidance comes step by step. <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> reminds us, &#8220;Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path&#8221;&#8212;enough light for the next step, not the whole map.<p>&#8226; The Lord reserves the right to unfold His will progressively (<a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17&#8211;18</a>). Saul must walk by faith, trusting the One who commands.<p>&#8226; This protects against self-reliance, echoing <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>: &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart&#8230; He will make your paths straight.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what you must do</b><p>&#8226; God already has specific assignments prepared (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).

Saul&#8217;s future preaching, suffering, and church planting are not optional add-ons; they are ordained.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16&#8211;18</a> details the commission Saul will receive: witness to Jews, Gentiles, and kings. The phrase assures him&#8212;and us&#8212;that purpose flows from God&#8217;s directive, not personal ambition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a> captures the moment Christ seizes Saul&#8217;s life. &#8220;Now&#8221; demands immediate attention; &#8220;get up&#8221; calls for bodily obedience; &#8220;go into the city&#8221; roots mission in real places; &#8220;you will be told&#8221; models daily dependence; and &#8220;what you must do&#8221; reveals a God-ordained purpose. The verse shows that conversion and calling are inseparable: the Savior who saves also directs, step by step, into the works He has prepared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And he trembling and astonished . . .</span>--The words stand, as far as textual authority is concerned, on the same footing as the foregoing, but, for the same reason, will be dealt with here. We note (1) the use of the word "Lord," now, we must believe, with a new meaning, as applied to the Nazarene whom he had before despised. (2) The entire surrender of his own will to that of Him whom he thus recognised as commanding his allegiance. At that moment Christ was formed in him (<a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>); the new man came to life. He lived in Christ, and Christ in him. "Not I, but Christ that liveth in me" (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>) was henceforward the axiom of his life.<p><span class= "bld">Arise, and go into the city.</span>--In the narrative of <a href="/acts/26-16.htm" title="But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;">Acts 26:16</a> there appears a fuller manifestation of the divine purpose as made at this time; but there St. Paul, in his rapid survey, is obviously combining, in one brief summary, the whole sum and substance of the teaching that was associated with that great turning-point of his life. We may trace in the command actually given a stage in the divine discipline appointed for his spirit. Silence and submission, and acquiescence in ignorance of the future, and patient expectation, and prayer for light--these were needed before he could be ready for the great work which was to be committed to his charge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Rise, and enter into the city</span> for <span class="accented">Arise, and go</span>, etc., A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
