This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where David speaks of the Lord saying to his Lord, "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."

The "restoration of all things" is linked to the return of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>). This restoration includes the renewal of the earth and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the Church.

This is the only passage in which the word translated "restitution" is found in the New Testament; nor is it found in the LXX. version of the Old. Etymologically, it conveys the thought of restoration to an earlier and better state, rather than that of simple consummation or completion, which the immediate context seems, in some measure, to suggest. It finds an interesting parallel in the "new heavens and new earth"--involving, as they do, a restoration of all things to their true order--of <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>. It does not necessarily involve, as some have thought, the final salvation of all men, but it does express the idea of a state in which "righteousness," and not "sin," shall have dominion over a redeemed and new created world; and that idea suggests a wider hope as to the possibilities of growth in wisdom and holiness, or even of repentance and conversion, in the unseen world than that with which Christendom has too often been content. The corresponding verb is found in the words, "Elias truly shall come first, and <span class= "ital">restore</span> all things" (see Note on <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>); and St. Peter's words may well be looked on as an echo of that teaching, and so as an undesigned coincidence testifying to the truth of St. Matthew's record.<p><span class= "bld">Which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets.</span>--The relative, if we take the meaning given above, must be referred to the "times," not to "things." The words, compared with <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, are, as it were, the utterance of a profound dogmatic truth.

If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (<a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of" the presence of the Lord," just as in St. Mark (<a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof God spake</span>.
