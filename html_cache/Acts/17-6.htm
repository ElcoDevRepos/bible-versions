The inability to find Paul and Silas highlights the tension and opposition faced by early Christians. This reflects the broader theme of persecution in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-3</a> and <a href="/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17-18</a>, where the apostles faced similar hostility.<p><b>they dragged Jason and some other brothers</b><br>Jason was likely a Jewish convert to Christianity who hosted Paul and Silas in his home. The act of dragging him and other believers before the authorities demonstrates the physical and social risks associated with being a Christian at the time. This mirrors the experiences of other early Christians who faced persecution, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32-34</a>, where believers endured public insults and confiscation of property.<p><b>before the city officials</b><br>The city officials, or "politarchs," were the governing authorities in Thessalonica. This term is unique to Acts and has been confirmed by archaeological findings, such as inscriptions in Thessalonica, validating Luke's historical accuracy. The involvement of city officials indicates the seriousness of the charges against the Christians, as they were seen as a threat to public order.<p><b>shouting, &#8220;These men who have turned the world upside down</b><br>The phrase "turned the world upside down" reflects the transformative impact of the Gospel message. The accusation suggests that the teachings of Paul and Silas were seen as revolutionary, challenging the established social and religious norms. This echoes the transformative nature of the Gospel as described in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.<p><b>have now come here</b><br>The arrival of Paul and Silas in Thessalonica is part of their second missionary journey, as recorded in <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16-18</a>. Their presence in the city signifies the spread of Christianity beyond Jerusalem and Judea, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth."

Aristotle, whose <span class= "ital">Politics</span> well-nigh exhausts the list of all known official titles in Greek cities, does not mention it, although he gives an analogous title (<span class= "ital">Politophylakes</span>) as found at Larissa and elsewhere (<span class= "ital">Pol. v.</span> 6). An inscription on an arch that still spans (or did so till quite lately) one of the streets of the modern city <span class= "ital">Saloniki, </span>shows it to have been a special official title of that city, and St. Luke's use of it may, therefore, be noted as an instance of his accuracy in such matters. The inscription is probably of the date of Vespasian, but it contains some names that are identical with those of the converts in the apostolic history, Sosipater ("Sopater," <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), Gaius (<a href="/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>), and Secundus (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>).

This is a remarkable instance of St. Luke's accuracy. The word is unknown in Greek literature. But an inscription on an ancient marble arch, still standing in Thessalonica, or Saloniki, records that Thessalonica was governed by seven politarchs (see the inscription in Conybeare and Howson, col. 1. p. 360).
