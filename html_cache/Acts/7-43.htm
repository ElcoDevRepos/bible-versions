Molech was a Canaanite deity associated with child sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). The "tabernacle" here symbolizes the portable shrine or tent used for idol worship, contrasting with the true Tabernacle of God. This highlights the Israelites' disobedience and syncretism, adopting pagan practices despite God's commands.<p><b>and the star of your god Rephan</b><br>Rephan, also known as Remphan or Chiun, is associated with a celestial deity worshiped by the Israelites. The "star" likely refers to an astral symbol or idol. This reflects the influence of surrounding cultures on Israel, as they adopted astral worship, which was common in ancient Near Eastern religions. The mention of Rephan underscores the Israelites' departure from monotheism and their engagement in idolatry.<p><b>the idols you made to worship</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the active role of the Israelites in creating idols, highlighting their deliberate choice to turn away from God. The making of idols is a direct violation of the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). This act of creating and worshiping idols signifies a breach of the covenant relationship with God, who had delivered them from Egypt and commanded exclusive worship.<p><b>Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.</b><br>This is a prophetic declaration of judgment. The reference to exile "beyond Babylon" alludes to the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, where the Israelites were punished for their persistent idolatry and disobedience. Historically, the Northern Kingdom of Israel was exiled by Assyria in 722 BC, and the Southern Kingdom of Judah by Babylon in 586 BC. This exile serves as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, illustrating the consequences of forsaking God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Stephen, is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.

The best explanation of this is that Rephan is the Coptic name of the planet Saturn, well-known of course to the LXX., and that Chiun is the Hebrew and Arabic name of the same star, which they therefore translated by Rephan. With regard to the difficulty which has been felt by many <span class="accented">that</span> there is no mention of any such worship of Moloch and Chiun in the wilderness, and that sacrifices were continually offered to the Lord, it seems to arise from an entire misconception of the passage in Amos. What Amos means to say is that because of the treacherous, unfaithful heart of Israel, as shown in the worship of the golden calf and all their rebellions in the wilderness, all their sacrifices were worthless. Just as he had said in <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts;" "I hate, I despise your feast days; Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols" (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21, 23</a>): just as Isaiah also says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?... I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts ... Bring no more vain oblations; ... it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting" (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>, etc.); and again, "He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood" (<a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>): so all the sacrifices offered up during forty years in the wilderness were no sacrifices at all, and their hypocrisy was clearly seen when they reached the land of Canaan, and, according to Moses' prophetic declaration, "forsook God which made them... aria sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-18</a>), such as Chiun and Moloch, Baalim and Ashtoreth. This later idolatry was the fruit and the judicial punishment of their first declension and apostasy in the wilderness, and led to the Captivity in Babylon. It was on seeing their unfaithfulness in the wilderness that" God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You took along</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(anelabete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_353.htm">Strong's 353: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take up, raise; I pick up, take on board; I carry off, lead away.
