This strategy is consistent with his background as a Pharisee and his deep understanding of Jewish law and tradition (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). It reflects his commitment to the principle of "to the Jew first" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), recognizing the Jews as God's chosen people and the initial recipients of His promises.<p><b>Paul went into the synagogue</b><br>The synagogue served as a central place for teaching and discussion of the Scriptures among the Jewish community. It was a natural starting point for Paul to share the message of Jesus as the Messiah. This practice is seen throughout Acts (<a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14</a>, <a href="/acts/14.htm">Acts 14:1</a>), highlighting the importance of engaging with those who had a foundational understanding of the Old Testament.<p><b>and on three Sabbaths</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest and worship for the Jewish people, making it an opportune time for Paul to engage with them. The mention of "three Sabbaths" indicates a period of persistent teaching and dialogue, suggesting that Paul was committed to thoroughly presenting his message and addressing any questions or objections.<p><b>he reasoned with them from the Scriptures</b><br>Paul's method involved reasoning, which implies a logical and persuasive presentation of the Gospel. He used the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) to demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. This approach is seen in other parts of Acts (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4</a>, <a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8</a>) and underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. It also reflects the Berean approach to Scripture, where the audience is encouraged to examine the Scriptures daily to verify the truth (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus.
