It was known for its strategic location, serving as a crossroads for various ancient trade routes. The mention of Mysia indicates the missionary journey's progression as Paul and his companions traveled through Asia Minor. This journey reflects the early church's expansion efforts and the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish territories.<p><b>they tried to enter Bithynia</b><br>Bithynia was a Roman province located to the northeast of Mysia, along the Black Sea coast. It was a significant area with a mix of Greek and Roman cultural influences. The attempt to enter Bithynia shows the apostles' desire to preach the Gospel in new regions, fulfilling the Great Commission to spread the message to all nations. However, their plans were subject to divine guidance, illustrating the importance of seeking God's will in ministry efforts.<p><b>but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit them</b><br>The "Spirit of Jesus" refers to the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the divine guidance and authority of Christ in directing the apostles' mission. This phrase highlights the personal and active role of the Holy Spirit in the early church, guiding believers in their decisions and actions. The Spirit's intervention here suggests that God had a specific plan and timing for the spread of the Gospel, which sometimes meant closing certain doors. This aligns with other scriptural instances where God's guidance redirects His servants, such as in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas.htm">Silas</a></b><br>A leader in the early church and companion of Paul on his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mysia.htm">Mysia</a></b><br>A region in northwest Asia Minor, which Paul and his companions passed through during their journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bithynia.htm">Bithynia</a></b><br>A province in Asia Minor that Paul and his companions intended to enter but were prevented by the Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_jesus.htm">Spirit of Jesus</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the divine guidance and intervention in the apostles' mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of seeking and being open to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives.

This moment illustrates that truth in real time.<p>&#8226; Rather than interpreting closed doors as failure, the missionaries treat them as guidance. <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a> reminds us, &#8220;The steps of a man are established by the LORD.&#8221; Obedient servants stay in motion, trusting God to steer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they tried to enter Bithynia</b><p>&#8226; The desire was good&#8212;take the gospel north into Bithynia.

Bithynia, lying to the north, had, like Pontus, a considerable Jewish population scattered along its shores, and they were inclined to take that as their next field of labour. They were led on, however, as before, westward and not northward. There is no record of any considerable halt in this stage of their journey, and they probably found few favourable openings in a district which, for great part of the way, presented only unimportant villages. The use of the archaic form "assayed" for "essayed," or "attempted," calls for a word of notice. (Comp. <a href="/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.">Acts 9:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit suffered them not.</span>--The better MSS. and versions give the reading, "the Spirit of Jesus," which is of some dogmatic importance, as confirming the doctrine that the Spirit stands in the same relation to the Son as to the Father, and may therefore be spoken of either as the Spirit of God, or of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
