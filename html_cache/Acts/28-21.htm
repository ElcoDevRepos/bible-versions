In the context of <a href="/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, Paul has arrived in Rome and is under house arrest. The leaders here are likely members of the Jewish community, which was significant in Rome at the time. This interaction shows Paul's continued effort to reach out to the Jewish people, consistent with his pattern of ministry throughout Acts.<p><b>We have not received any letters about you from Judea</b><br>The absence of letters from Judea suggests that the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem had not formally communicated with the Jewish community in Rome regarding Paul. This could indicate either a lack of interest or a delay in communication. Judea was the center of Jewish religious authority, and letters would have been a common way to convey important information. The lack of such letters might have been unexpected, given the opposition Paul faced in Jerusalem.<p><b>nor have any of the brothers from there reported</b><br>The term "brothers" refers to fellow Jews, possibly including those who were part of the early Christian movement. The absence of reports from these individuals suggests that there was no coordinated effort to discredit Paul among the Jewish diaspora. This could reflect the geographical distance and the challenges of communication in the ancient world.<p><b>or even mentioned anything bad about you</b><br>This phrase highlights the lack of negative testimony against Paul from those who might have been expected to oppose him. It underscores the idea that the accusations against Paul were not universally accepted or propagated among the Jewish communities outside of Judea. This absence of negative reports could be seen as providential, allowing Paul the opportunity to present his case and the gospel message without preconceived bias.<br><br>Overall, this passage reflects the complex dynamics of early Christian and Jewish relations, the spread of the gospel, and the role of Paul as a key figure in the early church.

The silence confirms Paul&#8217;s innocence, preserves his credibility, and allows him to present the gospel without prejudice, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise that Paul would proclaim Christ boldly even in the capital of the empire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">We neither received letters out of Judsea concerning thee . . .</span>--It seems strange at first that no tidings should have come from Jerusalem of what had passed there in connection with St. Paul's imprisonment. There was, however, hardly likely to have been time for any letters since his appeal. He had sailed somewhat late in the autumn, immediately after he had made it (<a href="/acts/25-13.htm" title="And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus.">Acts 25:13</a>; <a href="/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.">Acts 27:1</a>), and all communication by sea was suspended during the winter months. And it may be noted further that the Jews do not say that they had heard absolutely nothing about him, but that those who had come had spoken <span class= "ital">nothing evil</span> of him. What they had heard by casual rumour may well have been consistent with St. James's statement that "he walked orderly, and observed the Law" (<a href="/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:">Acts 21:20</a>). It has been urged that the decree of Claudius had suspended the intercourse between the Jews of Rome and those of Jerusalem; but as the former had returned before he wrote the Epistle to the Romans, this is hardly a tenable explanation. It may, however, be taken into account that among the Jews who had returned to Rome would be not a few of those who had known St. Paul at Corinth, and were willing to bear their testimony to his character.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- From</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nor</span> for <span class="accented">neither</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak</span> for <span class="accented">any of the brethren that came showed or spake</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Nor did any of the brethren come hither</span>, etc. This is no improvement on the A.V.; for it implies that they denied that any special messenger had been sent to speak harm of Paul, which nobody could have thought had been done. What they meant to say is exactly what the A.V. makes them say, viz. that, neither by special letters, nor by message nor casual information brought by Jews coming to Rome from Judaea, had they heard any harm of him. This seems odd; but as the Jews had no apparent motive for not speaking the truth, we must accept it as true. The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius (<a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>) may have slackened the intercourse between Judaea and Rome; the attention of the Jews may have been absorbed by their accusation of Felix; there had been a very short interval between Paul's appeal and his departure for Rome; he had only been at Rome three days, and so it is very possible that no report had yet reached Rome concerning him at this early season of the year. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The leaders] replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
