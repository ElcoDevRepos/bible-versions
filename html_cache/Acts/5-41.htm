The apostles had been brought before this council for preaching about Jesus Christ. This setting highlights the tension between the early Christian movement and the established Jewish authority. The apostles' departure signifies their release after being flogged, a common punishment intended to deter further preaching.<p><b>rejoicing that they had been counted worthy</b><br>The apostles' reaction of joy is significant, as it reflects their deep commitment to their faith and mission. In the context of first-century Judaism, suffering for one's beliefs was often seen as a sign of divine favor and alignment with God's purposes. This joy is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, who in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>) spoke of the blessedness of those persecuted for righteousness.<p><b>of suffering disgrace</b><br>Suffering disgrace refers to the public humiliation and physical punishment the apostles endured. In the cultural context of the time, honor and shame were pivotal social values. To suffer disgrace was to be publicly shamed, yet the apostles embraced this as a badge of honor, aligning themselves with Christ, who also suffered disgrace (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><b>for the Name</b><br>The "Name" refers to Jesus Christ. In Jewish tradition, the name of God was held in the highest reverence, and here, the apostles equate the name of Jesus with divine authority and power. This reflects the early Christian belief in the divinity of Christ and their willingness to endure persecution for His sake. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of suffering for God's name, as seen in the experiences of the prophets and in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/john/15-21.htm">John 15:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage, specifically Peter and John, who were leaders in the early Christian church and were spreading the message of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council and court that held authority over religious matters in Jerusalem.

Yet the apostles embraced it because it tethered them to Christ, who &#8220;endured the cross, scorning its shame&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture links suffering for Jesus with future glory:<p>&#8211; &#8220;If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;I will show him how much he must suffer for My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>) &#8212; spoken of Paul, later fulfilled in his life.<p>&#8226; Practical implications today:<p>&#8211; Expect opposition (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>); be ready to absorb reproach without retaliation (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p>&#8211; Remember that earthly disgrace often equals heavenly applause (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a>).<p>&#8211; Keep the focus on the Name, not on personal reputation (<a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a> reveals a stunning, Spirit-empowered mindset: persecution is a privilege, not a setback. Walking out of the Sanhedrin&#8217;s chambers bloodied yet beaming, the apostles model how believers, confident in Christ&#8217;s approval and future reward, can celebrate even when the world shames them. Suffering for &#8220;the Name&#8221; verifies true allegiance, advances the gospel, and pleases the God who deems His servants &#8220;worthy.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Rejoicing that they were counted worthy.</span>--The emotion is probably, in one sense, natural to all who have an intense conviction of the Truth for which they suffer.
