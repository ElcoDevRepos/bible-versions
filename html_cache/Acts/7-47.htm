He is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, most notably the Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon's reign marked a period of peace and prosperity for Israel, allowing him to undertake such grand projects. His role in building the Temple fulfills the promise God made to David that his son would build a house for God's name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). Solomon's wisdom and leadership are highlighted in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>, where God grants him wisdom because he asked for discernment to govern the people rather than for personal gain.<p><b>who built the house</b><br>The "house" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and a central place of worship for the Israelites. Before the Temple, the Ark was housed in a tent, the Tabernacle, which was a temporary and mobile sanctuary. The construction of the Temple signified a shift from a nomadic to a more settled form of worship. The building of the Temple is detailed in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>, describing its grandeur and the materials used, such as cedar from Lebanon and gold overlay. The Temple served as a symbol of God's presence among His people and a place where sacrifices and offerings were made.<p><b>for Him</b><br>The "Him" refers to God, emphasizing that the Temple was built for the worship and glory of God, not for Solomon's own honor. This aligns with the biblical theme that all things are ultimately for God's glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The Temple was a place where God's name would dwell, and it was meant to be a house of prayer for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). The dedication of the Temple by Solomon, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, includes a prayer acknowledging God's greatness and asking for His presence and blessing upon the people of Israel. Solomon's Temple also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that God's presence would ultimately dwell in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.
