This phrase highlights the widespread dissemination of Jewish teachings and laws throughout the Roman Empire. Historically, Jewish communities were established in many cities, especially after the Babylonian exile, leading to the spread of Jewish customs and laws. This widespread presence is evidenced by archaeological findings of synagogues and Jewish inscriptions in various cities across the Mediterranean region.<p><b>from ancient times</b><br>This phrase underscores the long-standing tradition of Jewish teachings being shared and upheld. The Jewish diaspora, which began with the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, led to the establishment of Jewish communities far from Israel. These communities maintained their religious practices and teachings over centuries, ensuring that the Law of Moses was known and respected even outside of Israel. This historical continuity is crucial for understanding the context of the early Christian church, which emerged within this Jewish framework.<p><b>and is read in the synagogues</b><br>The synagogue served as the center of Jewish religious life, especially in the diaspora. It was a place for prayer, teaching, and community gatherings. The reading of the Torah was a central part of synagogue worship, with specific portions assigned to be read each Sabbath. This practice ensured that the Jewish people, regardless of their location, remained connected to their religious heritage and laws. The regular reading of the Torah in synagogues also provided a foundation for the early Christian practice of reading Scripture in their gatherings.<p><b>on every Sabbath.</b><br>The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, is a day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, as commanded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). The weekly reading of the Torah on the Sabbath was a key aspect of Jewish religious life, reinforcing the teachings of Moses and the importance of the Law. This practice not only preserved the Jewish faith but also influenced early Christian worship, as the first Christians were Jews who continued to observe the Sabbath and other Jewish customs. The regular reading of Scripture on the Sabbath laid the groundwork for the Christian tradition of reading from the Bible during worship services.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the lawgiver who received the Ten Commandments from God.

James reminds the Jerusalem council that the voice of the Law is not silent&#8212;it is continually proclaimed. Luke previously recorded this pattern when Paul and Barnabas visited Pisidian Antioch: &#8220;After the reading of the Law and the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-15.htm">Acts 13:15</a>). Jesus spoke of the same living testimony: &#8220;If you believed Moses, you would believe Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>). The Law is therefore an active witness, still pointing to righteousness and, ultimately, to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in every city</b><p>From Alexandria to Rome, wherever Jewish communities settled, they carried the scrolls of Moses with them.<p>&#8226; Paul could locate a synagogue in virtually every city he visited&#8212;Iconium (<a href="/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>), Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1</a>), Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This widespread presence means that God had already prepared venues where Gentile believers could continue learning the moral truths embodied in the Law, even as salvation itself rests on grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from ancient times</b><p>The practice of public reading began early. Moses himself commanded, &#8220;Assemble the people&#8230;so they may hear and learn&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>). Joshua followed suit (<a href="/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34&#8211;35</a>), and Josiah revived it centuries later (<a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>). The longevity underscores God&#8217;s design: His Word is enduring, unchanging, and meant for every generation (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and is read in the synagogues</b><p>Synagogues functioned as community centers of worship and instruction.<p>&#8226; Jesus read Isaiah in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul leveraged the same setting &#8220;every Sabbath&#8221; to reason from the Scriptures (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4</a>).<p>Because the Law is publicly read, Jewish believers remain continually shaped by it, and Gentile believers have access to it without bearing the yoke of ceremonial requirements (<a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on every Sabbath</b><p>Weekly repetition engrains truth. <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8&#8211;11</a> links the Sabbath rhythm to creation, showing God&#8217;s intention for regular rest and reflection. By the first century, the Sabbath was the established time for hearing Moses, ensuring that ethical teachings&#8212;such as purity, sexual integrity, and honoring God alone&#8212;remained fresh before the people (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>James&#8217;s statement in <a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a> affirms that God had already placed His Law within earshot of both Jews and Gentiles. Because Moses is proclaimed everywhere, the council could lay only essential restrictions on Gentile converts, confident that ongoing synagogue readings would continue to instruct them in God&#8217;s timeless moral standards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For Moses of old time.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of ancient generations.</span> The conjunction gives the reason for writing to the Gentiles, and giving them these injunctions. The Jews, who heard the Law in their synagogues every Sabbath, did not need instruction. It might be taken for granted that they would adhere to the rules now specified. So, in <a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>, the encyclical letter is addressed exclusively to "the brethren of the Gentiles."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - From <span class="accented">generations of old</span> for <span class="accented">of old time</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sabbath</span> for <span class="accented">sabbath day</span>, A.V. The meaning of this verse seems to be that, in requiring the above compliances, the council was not enjoining anything new or strange, because the Gentiles who attended the synagogues were familiar with these Mosaic doctrines. It has been often stated that these four prohibitions were in substance the same as the so-called seven precepts of Noah, which were binding upon proselytes of the gate. This is, however, scarcely borne out by the facts. The four prohibitions seem to have been a temporary arrangement adapted to the then condition of the Church, with a view to enabling Christian Jews and Gentiles to live in brotherly fellowship. The Jew was not to require more of his Gentile brother: the Gentile was not to concede less to his Jewish brother. St. Augustine ('Cont. Manich.,' 32, 13), quoted by Meyer, ridicules the idea of Christians in his time being bound by the law of things strangled (see Hooker and Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth, in the same sense). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
