The "hand of the Lord" is a biblical metaphor for God's power and authority, often used in the Old Testament to describe God's active involvement in human affairs (e.g., <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>). In this context, it indicates that God is directly opposing Elymas the sorcerer, who is attempting to hinder the spread of the Gospel. This act of judgment serves as a warning against opposing God's work and highlights the authority of the apostles as God's representatives.<p><b>and for a time you will be blind</b><br>The temporary nature of Elymas's blindness suggests both judgment and mercy. Blindness is a recurring theme in Scripture, often symbolizing spiritual ignorance or rebellion against God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>, <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). The temporary blindness of Elymas parallels Saul's own experience on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8-9</a>), where physical blindness led to spiritual insight and transformation. This suggests the possibility of repentance and redemption for Elymas.<p><b>and unable to see the light of the sun.&#8221;</b><br>The inability to see the sun emphasizes the severity of Elymas's condition. In biblical symbolism, light often represents truth, knowledge, and divine revelation (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Elymas's physical blindness mirrors his spiritual blindness, as he is unable to perceive the truth of the Gospel. This phrase underscores the contrast between spiritual darkness and the light of Christ, which the apostles are proclaiming.<p><b>Immediately mist and darkness came over him</b><br>The immediate fulfillment of the prophecy demonstrates the power and authority of the apostolic message. The "mist and darkness" evoke imagery of confusion and disorientation, reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>) and the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a>). This serves as a tangible sign of God's judgment and a confirmation of the apostles' divine commission.<p><b>and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</b><br>This phrase illustrates Elymas's helplessness and dependence on others, highlighting the consequences of opposing God's work. The imagery of groping in darkness is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, where it describes the curse of disobedience. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual blindness and the need for guidance, pointing to the necessity of divine intervention for true understanding and salvation. Elymas's condition contrasts with the spiritual enlightenment offered through faith in Christ, as seen in the transformation of Saul, who was once blind but now sees.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>A key apostle and missionary in the early church, who was filled with the Holy Spirit and pronounced judgment on Elymas.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elymas.htm">Elymas (Bar-Jesus)</a></b><br>A Jewish sorcerer and false prophet who opposed Paul and Barnabas, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sergius_paulus.htm">Sergius Paulus</a></b><br>The proconsul of Cyprus, an intelligent man who sought to hear the word of God from Paul and Barnabas.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyprus.htm">Cyprus</a></b><br>An island in the Mediterranean Sea where Paul and Barnabas were preaching the gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_the_lord.htm">The Hand of the Lord</a></b><br>A phrase indicating divine intervention or judgment, often seen in the Old Testament as a sign of God's power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_and_judgment.htm">Divine Authority and Judgment</a></b><br>God's authority is supreme, and He can intervene directly in human affairs to accomplish His purposes.

(Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be blind, not</span> <span class= "bld">seeing the sun for a season.</span>--The form of the punishment may have been, in part, determined by the Apostle's choice as manifested in prayer. If so, it suggests the thought that he had looked back on his own blindness, the exclusion of the outward light, as being that which had been to him the process by which he was led to the Sun of Righteousness and the Light that lighteth every man, and hoped that it might be so now. (See Note on <a href="/context/acts/9-8.htm" title="And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.">Acts 9:8-9</a>.) In any case, there was a moral fitness in blindness as the penalty of the sin the very essence of which was that the man was fighting against light. That the blindness was to be "for a season" only implies that it was designed to be remedial and not simply retributive.<p><span class= "bld">There fell on him a mist and a darkness . . .</span>--Here, as in the "scales" of <a href="/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>, we seem to trace something of the precision of the trained physician. The first effect of the loss of the power to see was, as in the case of St. Paul, that Elymas, who had selfishly used his knowledge to guide others to his own advantage, now had to seek for others to guide his own steps. The tense of the Greek verb (<span class= "ital">he was seeking</span>) seems to imply that he sought and did not find. He had no friends to help him, and was left to his fate unpitied. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is upon thee</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">against thee</span> (<a href="/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-55.htm">Matthew 26:55</a>; <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a>; and ver. 50 of this chapter). <span class="cmt_word">For a season</span>.

As regards the reason why the particular punishment of blindness was inflicted upon Elymas, it might be to put a forcible interruption upon those observations of the stars and clouds by which the magician pretended to foresee the future. It would exhibit, too, to Sergius, Paulus the utter helplessness of the great necromancer. <span class="cmt_word">Some to lead him by the hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, as</span> Saul had needed <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> when he was struck blind by the vision of the Savior's glory (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">look,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
