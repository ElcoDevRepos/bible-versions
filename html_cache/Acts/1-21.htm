This reflects the importance of maintaining the number of the Twelve Apostles, which symbolizes the twelve tribes of Israel.

The use of "necessary" indicates a divine mandate, suggesting that the apostles are acting under God's guidance.<p><b>who have accompanied us</b><br>The criteria for selection include having been a companion of the apostles.

1:21 Mean</div><b>Therefore</b><p>- This word connects Peter&#8217;s instruction to what has just been stated. After citing <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a> and <a href="/psalms/109-8.htm">Psalm 109:8</a> (<a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>), Peter shows the disciples that Scripture demands action in response to Judas&#8217;s betrayal.<p>- Acts often uses &#8220;therefore&#8221; to highlight obedience to revealed truth (<a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>; 13:38). Here, the transition underscores that replacing Judas is not optional&#8212;it flows directly from the authority of God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is necessary</b><p>- Peter stresses divine necessity, not mere human preference. The same phrase appears when Jesus said, &#8220;The Son of Man must be delivered&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>), indicating God&#8217;s sovereign plan.<p>- The apostles understand their role as stewards of Christ&#8217;s mission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Their first corporate act is to align with God&#8217;s predetermined will, modeled on how Jesus Himself fulfilled what &#8220;must&#8221; take place (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to choose one of the men</b><p>- Leadership in the early church is portrayed as male, consistent with Jesus&#8217; selection of twelve men (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13-19</a>).<p>- Yet the process is communal: the group will pray, consider qualifications, and cast lots (<a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>). This mirrors Old Testament patterns where God guided selection through representative heads (<a href="/numbers/27-15.htm">Numbers 27:15-23</a>).<p>- The replacement must be &#8220;one of the men,&#8221; signaling that not everyone qualified simply by being present; specific criteria follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who have accompanied us</b><p>- Faithful presence matters. The candidate must have walked with the apostles, sharing their trials and teachings (<a href="/luke/22-28.htm">Luke 22:28</a>).<p>- This echoes Moses&#8217; plea for helpers who &#8220;stand there with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-22.htm">Exodus 18:22</a>). Reliability over time proves character and understanding of Jesus&#8217; ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole time</b><p>- Continuous discipleship is the standard. Sporadic followers or recent converts are excluded. Paul later applies the same principle to elders: &#8220;He must not be a recent convert&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6</a>).<p>- From John&#8217;s baptism to the ascension (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>) covers roughly three years&#8212;enough time to grasp Jesus&#8217; identity and message firsthand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Lord Jesus went in and out among us</b><p>- The phrase pictures Jesus&#8217; daily movement with the disciples&#8212;teaching, healing, praying, and sharing life (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/mark/3-20.htm">Mark 3:20-21</a>).<p>- Calling Him &#8220;the Lord Jesus&#8221; affirms His deity and authority, a truth they now fully understand after the resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>).<p>- A witness of Jesus&#8217; public ministry and private instruction ensures the new apostle can testify credibly to His words and works (<a href="/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21</a> shows the apostles&#8217; commitment to Scripture-guided obedience. Peter explains that replacing Judas is required (&#8220;therefore&#8230; it is necessary&#8221;) and lays out qualifications rooted in long-term, firsthand experience with Jesus. The chosen man must have walked with the Lord from the beginning, observing every aspect of His earthly ministry. By insisting on these standards, the early church ensures its leadership remains faithful to Christ&#8217;s teaching and trustworthy in proclaiming His resurrection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Wherefore of these men which have companied with us.</span>--From the retrospective glance at the guilt and punishment of the traitor, Peter passes, as with a practical sagacity, to the one thing that was now needful for the work of the infant Church. They, the Apostles, must present themselves to the people in their symbolic completeness, as sent to the twelve tribes of Israel, and the gap left by the traitor must be filled by one qualified, as they were, to bear witness of what had been said or done by their Lord during His ministry, and, above all, of His resurrection from the dead.
