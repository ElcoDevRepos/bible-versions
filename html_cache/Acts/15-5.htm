The Pharisees were a Jewish sect known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and traditions. Their involvement in the early church indicates the diverse backgrounds of early believers. The fact that they "stood up" suggests a formal setting, likely the Jerusalem Council, where significant theological debates were taking place. This council was a pivotal moment in the early church, addressing the integration of Gentile converts.<p><b>&#8220;The Gentiles must be circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>) and a critical identity marker for Jews. The demand for Gentiles to be circumcised reflects the struggle within the early church to define the requirements for salvation and inclusion in the community of believers. This issue was not merely about physical circumcision but about adherence to Jewish identity and law. The insistence on circumcision for Gentiles was a point of contention, as it implied that faith in Christ alone was insufficient for salvation.<p><b>and required to obey the law of Moses.&#8221;</b><br>The "law of Moses" refers to the Torah, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws given to Israel. The Pharisees' demand that Gentiles obey these laws underscores the tension between Jewish traditions and the new covenant established through Jesus Christ. This requirement would have included dietary laws, Sabbath observance, and other cultural practices. The debate over this issue is central to understanding the early church's struggle to define the role of the Mosaic Law in the life of believers, especially in light of passages like <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a>, which discuss the law as a tutor leading to Christ.

Their concern sprang from a Pharisaic heritage that equated covenant membership with circumcision and meticulous rule-keeping. By recording their objection, Scripture sets the stage for the Jerusalem Council to clarify that salvation rests on grace alone, not on external ceremonies or legal observance. The verse reminds today&#8217;s church to guard the purity of the gospel, listen patiently to differing voices, and measure every requirement by the finished work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed.</span>--This is the first distinct mention of the conversion of any of the Pharisaic party, but there had been a drift in that direction going on for some time, beginning during our Lord's ministry (<a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>), and showing itself in the moderate counsels of Gamaliel (<a href="/context/acts/5-38.htm" title="And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:">Acts 5:38-39</a>). The position which they occupied was that of accepting Jesus as a teacher sent from God, proved by the Resurrection to be the Christ, and as such the Head of a kingdom which was to present to mankind a restored and glorified Judaism, the Law kept in its completeness, the Temple ritual still maintained, Gentiles admitted only on their confessing their inferiority and accepting the sign of incorporation with the superior race. It appears, from <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a>, that here, as in so many later controversies, the general issue was debated on an individual case. Was Titus--a Greek, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a Gentile, whom St. Paul had brought up with him--to be circumcised, or not? Was he to be admitted to communion with the Church, or treated as a heathen? Here, probably, there was no official rank as in the case of Cornelius, no previous transition stage in passing through the synagogue as a proselyte of the gate. He was a Gentile pure and simple, and as such his case was a crucial one. Circumcision, however, did not stand alone. It carried with it every jot and tittle of the Law, the Sabbaths and the feasts, the distinction between clean and unclean meats. It may be noted that the position which Titus occupied in this controversy gave him a special fitness for the work afterwards assigned to him, of contending against the party of the circumcision, with their "Jewish fables" and false standards of purity (<a href="/titus/1-10.htm" title="For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:">Titus 1:10</a>; <a href="/context/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Who</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">it is</span> for <span class="accented">that it was</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">charge</span> for <span class="accented">command</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>There rose up</span>, etc. As soon as Paul and Barnabas had finished their recital of the conversion of the heathen to whom they had preached the gospel, certain Christian Pharisees who were at the meeting disturbed the joy of the brethren and the unanimity of the assembly by getting up and saying that all the Gentile converts must be circumcised and keep the Law. This, of course, would have included Titus, who was present with St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>). The Epistle to the Galatians deals directly and forcibly with this question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
