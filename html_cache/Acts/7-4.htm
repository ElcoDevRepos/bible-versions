Ur was a significant city known for its advanced culture and idolatry, which Abraham was called to leave behind. This departure signifies a break from pagan practices and a step of faith in obedience to God's call (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). It marks the beginning of Abraham's journey as the father of the nation of Israel, highlighting the theme of faith and obedience that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p><b>and settled in Haran.</b><br>Haran is located in modern-day Turkey, and it served as a temporary dwelling place for Abraham and his family. This city was a major trade center and shared cultural similarities with Ur, including the worship of the moon god. Abraham's stay in Haran represents a transitional period before fully entering the Promised Land. It underscores the patience and timing of God's promises, as Abraham waited for further direction (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>).<p><b>After his father died,</b><br>Terah, Abraham's father, died in Haran at the age of 205 (<a href="/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>). This event marks a turning point in Abraham's journey, as he was then free to continue to Canaan, the land God promised to him and his descendants. The death of Terah can symbolize the end of old ties and the beginning of a new chapter in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>God brought him out of that place</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's active role in guiding Abraham. It was not merely Abraham's decision but a divine calling and leading. God's sovereignty and faithfulness are highlighted, as He fulfills His promises and directs the steps of those who trust in Him (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). This act of God bringing Abraham out is a type of salvation, foreshadowing how God delivers His people from sin and leads them to spiritual inheritance.<p><b>and into this land where you are now living.</b><br>The land referred to is Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This land is central to the biblical narrative, representing God's covenant and faithfulness. It is the same land where the audience of Stephen's speech in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a> is residing, connecting the past promises to their present reality. The land of Canaan is a type of the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Abraham is the patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Stephen treats that history as literal fact.<p>&#8226; Ur (in Chaldea) was a center of idolatry (<a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2&#8211;3</a>). Abraham&#8217;s departure marks a clean break with a pagan past&#8212;an act of faith celebrated in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>.<p>&#8226; Stephen&#8217;s point to the Sanhedrin: God&#8217;s saving activity was already at work far beyond the borders of Israel or any temple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and settled in Haran</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a> tells us Terah led the family to Haran, roughly halfway to Canaan.<p>&#8226; Haran became a temporary home, showing that God sometimes guides His people in stages.<p>&#8226; The stopover underscores patience in obedience; Abraham walked the light he had, waiting for fresh direction (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights God&#8217;s graciousness: He continues leading even when His people pause.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After his father&#8217;s death</b><p>&#8226; Terah&#8217;s passing (<a href="/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>) removed the last earthly tie holding Abraham back.<p>&#8226; Stephen subtly reminds his listeners that allegiance to God can eclipse the closest family bond (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereignty in every season; nothing&#8212;life or death&#8212;can thwart His purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God brought him to this land where you now live</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5&#8211;7</a> records the literal entry into Canaan and the first promise of the land.

Stephen cites this history to prove that God&#8217;s redemptive work has never been bound to geography, ancestry, or human structures. The verse calls today&#8217;s believer to the same wholehearted trust: leave the old life, follow where He leads, and rest in the certainty that God finishes what He starts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">From thence, when his father was dead.</span>--In <a href="/genesis/11-26.htm" title="And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.">Genesis 11:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>, Terah, the father of Abraham, is said to have died at the age of 205 years, and after he had reached the age of seventy to have begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; while Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a> is said to have been seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran. This, <span class= "ital">prima facie, </span>suggests the conclusion that he lived for sixty years after his son's departure. The explanations sometimes given--(1) that Abraham may have been the youngest, not the eldest son of Terah, placed first in order of honour, not of time, as Shem is among the sons of Noah (<a href="/genesis/5-32.htm" title="And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 5:32</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-10.htm" title="And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 6:10</a>), though Japheth was the elder (<a href="/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>); and (2) that the marriage of Abraham's son with the granddaughter of Nahor by the youngest of his eight sons, Bethuel (<a href="/genesis/22-22.htm" title="And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.">Genesis 22:22</a>), suggests some such difference of age, and that he may therefore have been born when Terah was 130, and so have remained in Haran till his father's death--though probable as an hypothesis, would hardly appear so natural an explanation as that the memory of St. Stephen or of his reporter dwelt upon the broad outlines of the history, and was indifferent to chronological details. It is remarkable that like difficulties present themselves in St. Paul's own survey of the history of Israel. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/13-20.htm" title="And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.">Acts 13:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>.) A man speaking for his life, and pleading for the truth with a passionate eagerness, does not commonly carry with him a <span class= "ital">memoria technica</span> of chronological <span class= "ital">minuti?.</span> This seems, on the whole, a more satisfactory explanation than the assumption that the Apostle, having a clear recollection of the facts as we find them, brought them before his hearers in a form which presented at least the appearance of inaccuracy. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Haran</span> for <span class="accented">Charran</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God removed</span> for <span class="accented">he</span> removed, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Chaldaeans</span>.
