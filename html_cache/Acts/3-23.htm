The call to listen is a recurring biblical theme, underscoring the importance of obedience to God's chosen messenger. In the context of Acts, Peter is addressing the Jewish audience, urging them to recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The concept of listening implies not just hearing but also obeying and following the teachings of Christ, which is a central tenet of Christian discipleship.<p><b>will be completely cut off</b><br>The phrase "completely cut off" indicates a severe consequence for disobedience. In the Old Testament, being "cut off" often referred to being excluded from the community of Israel, which could mean physical death or spiritual separation (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>). This reflects the seriousness of rejecting God's appointed prophet. In the New Testament context, it implies eternal separation from God, highlighting the gravity of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. This serves as a warning to the audience about the eternal implications of their response to Christ.<p><b>from among his people.</b><br>This phrase underscores the communal aspect of faith in the biblical narrative. In the Old Testament, being part of "his people" meant being included in the covenant community of Israel. For the early Christians, it meant being part of the new covenant community, the Church. The warning here is that rejection of Jesus results in exclusion from the people of God, both in a temporal and eternal sense. This reflects the shift from a national identity to a spiritual one, where faith in Christ determines inclusion in God's people, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-8</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' apostles, delivering a sermon in Solomon's Colonnade after healing a lame man.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- Referenced by Peter as a prophet who spoke of a future prophet like himself, whom the people must listen to.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>- The ultimate prophet and fulfillment of Moses' prophecy, whom Peter is urging the people to heed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_colonnade.htm">Solomon's Colonnade</a></b><br>- A part of the Temple in Jerusalem where Peter and John were teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>- The primary audience of Peter's sermon, who are being called to repentance and faith in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_jesus.htm">The Importance of Listening to Jesus</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were warned to heed the prophet like Moses, we are called to listen to Jesus, the ultimate prophet and Son of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Ignoring Jesus' teachings leads to spiritual separation, akin to being "cut off" from God's people.
