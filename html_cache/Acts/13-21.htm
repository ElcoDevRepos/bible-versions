This request marked a significant shift from the theocratic rule under judges to a monarchy. The people's desire for a king was influenced by their desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), which was contrary to God's intention for Israel to be distinct and set apart (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This request was seen as a rejection of God's direct rule over them.<p><b>and God gave them Saul son of Kish</b><br>Saul was chosen by God despite the people's misguided motives. His selection is detailed in <a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9-10</a>. Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin, which was the smallest tribe (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), highlighting God's sovereignty in choosing leaders.

Saul's selection from this tribe demonstrates God's ability to bring leadership from unexpected places. Benjamin's location, between the northern and southern tribes, also had strategic significance for uniting the kingdom.<p><b>who ruled forty years</b><br>Saul's reign is traditionally understood to have lasted forty years, though the exact duration is debated due to textual variations (<a href="/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>). The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or judgment in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness wandering (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).
