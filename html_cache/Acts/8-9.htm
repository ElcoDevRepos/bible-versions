It suggests a time when the influence of Simon the sorcerer was unchallenged. The phrase implies a transition from the old ways to the new message of the Gospel brought by Philip.<p><b>a man named Simon</b><br>Simon is a central figure in this passage, known historically as Simon Magus. His name is associated with the practice of magic and sorcery. Early church writings, such as those by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, mention Simon as a significant figure in early heretical movements, indicating his lasting impact on early Christian history.<p><b>had practiced sorcery in the city</b><br>Sorcery, or magic, was common in the ancient world and often involved invoking spirits or using supernatural powers for personal gain. In the biblical context, sorcery is condemned (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). Simon's practice of sorcery in Samaria highlights the spiritual darkness and deception present before the Gospel's arrival. This also sets the stage for the power of the Holy Spirit to be demonstrated as superior to any form of magic.<p><b>and astounded the people of Samaria</b><br>The people of Samaria were amazed by Simon's abilities, which suggests that his sorcery was convincing and influential. This amazement reflects the spiritual hunger and openness of the Samaritans, which later becomes significant when they respond to Philip's preaching. The Samaritans' reaction to Simon's sorcery contrasts with their later acceptance of the Gospel, showing a shift from deception to truth.<p><b>He claimed to be someone great</b><br>Simon's self-proclamation of greatness indicates his pride and desire for power. This claim can be seen as a form of self-exaltation, which is contrary to the humility exemplified by Jesus Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). Simon's assertion of greatness also sets up a contrast with the true greatness of Jesus and the apostles, who perform miracles not for personal glory but to glorify God and advance His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_sorcerer.htm">Simon the Sorcerer</a></b><br>A man who practiced sorcery in Samaria and claimed to be someone great.

For the present it will be convenient to deal only with the materials which St. Luke gives us, reserving a fuller account for the close of the narrative. Nothing is told us here as to his earlier history, prior to his arrival in Samaria. The name indicates Jewish or Samaritan origin. He appears as the type of a class but too common at the time, that of Jews trading on the mysterious <span class= "ital">prestige</span> of their race and the credulity of the heathen, claiming supernatural power exercised through charms and incantations. Such afterwards was Elymas at Cyprus (<a href="/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a>); such were the vagabond Jews exorcists at Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>); such was a namesake, Simon of Cyprus (unless, indeed, we have a re-appearance of the same man), who also claimed to be a magician, and who pandered to the vices of Felix, the Procurator of Judaea, by persuading Drusilla (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7, ? 2, see Note on <a href="/acts/24-24.htm" title="And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.">Acts 24:24</a>) to leave her first husband and to marry him. The life of such a man, like that of the Cagliostro fraternity in all ages, was a series of strange adventures, and startling as the statements as to his previous life may seem (see Note on <a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>), they are not in themselves incredible.

Later legends enter fully into the various forms of sorcery of which Simon made use. (See below.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Simon by name</span> for <span class="accented">called Simon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the city</span> for <span class="accented">the same city</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">amazed</span> for <span class="accented">bewitched</span>, A.V. (here and in ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Amazed.</span> In <a href="/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22</a> the same word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>) is rendered "made us astonished" in the A.V.; and in <a href="/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7, 12</a>, and elsewhere, in an intransitive sense, "were amazed." It has also the meaning of "being out of one's mind," or "beside one's self" (<a href="/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>), but never that of "bewitching" or "being bewitched." As regards <span class="cmt_word">Simon</span>, commonly surnamed Magus, from his magic arts, it is doubtful whether he is the same Simon as is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 7:2) as being employed by Felix the Procurator of Judaea, in the reign of Claudius (<a href="/acts/23-25.htm">Acts 23:25</a>), to bewitch Drusfila into forsaking her husband, King Azizus, and marrying him, which she did (<a href="/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>). The doubt arises from Josephus stating <span class="accented">that</span> Simon to be a Cypriot (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), whereas Justin Martyr says of Simon Magus that he was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a native of Gitton, or Githon, a village of Samaria. It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy. (For a list of authorities concerning Simon, see Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 260, note; Alford, 1:6; 'Bible Dictionary; 'and a good article in 'Dict. of Biog. and Mythol.') <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Prior to that time,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#971;&#960;&#8134;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proup&#275;rchen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4391.htm">Strong's 4391: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have been already, have been previously.
