This reflects the practical outworking of faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is dead. The believers in Antioch demonstrated their commitment to the unity of the church by providing for their brothers and sisters in Judea.<p><b>sending their gifts</b><br>The act of sending gifts highlights the principle of generosity and support within the early Christian community. This is reminiscent of the communal sharing described in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>. The gifts were likely financial or material aid intended to alleviate the anticipated hardship due to the famine. This act of charity underscores the interconnectedness of the early church, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.<p><b>to the elders</b><br>The elders were the leaders of the church in Jerusalem, responsible for spiritual oversight and administration. This reflects the early church's structure, where elders played a crucial role in governance, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. The decision to send the gifts to the elders indicates a recognition of their authority and responsibility in distributing aid.<p><b>with Barnabas and Saul</b><br>Barnabas and Saul (later known as Paul) were trusted leaders and missionaries in the early church. Their involvement in delivering the gifts underscores their role as bridge-builders between the Gentile and Jewish believers. Barnabas, known for his encouragement and generosity (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36-37</a>), and Saul, a former persecutor turned apostle, exemplify the transformative power of the Gospel. Their mission to deliver the gifts also foreshadows their future missionary journeys, as recorded in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a> and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of new believers.

Verse 30 opens with &#8220;This they did,&#8221; underscoring that the Antioch believers moved immediately from decision to action.<p>&#8226; Their obedience was practical, not theoretical&#8212;mirroring exhortations such as <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a> and <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17-18</a>, which insist that genuine faith must meet real needs.<p>&#8226; The gravity of the coming famine (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>) called for tangible help, and the church trusted God enough to part with resources before the crisis fully struck.<p>&#8226;

Officers filling like functions were known in the Gentile churches as Episcopi = Bishops, or Superintendents, and where Jews and Gentiles were mingled, the two names were interchangeable, as in <a href="/context/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17-18</a>; <a href="/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>.

This is the first mention of presbyters, or elders, in the Church at Jerusalem, which was now fully organized. James the Less was the resident apostle (?) and bishop; with him were the presbyters (<a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>); and under them again the seven deacons (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5, 6</a>).

A difficulty arises with regard to Saul's mission to Jerusalem with Barnabas, as to how to reconcile it with <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, which speaks of St. Paul's second visit to Jerusalem as taking place fourteen years after his first, whereas this visit could not be above four or <span class="accented">five</span> years after.
