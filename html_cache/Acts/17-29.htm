It reflects the biblical teaching that all people are God's creation and have intrinsic value. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is often referred to as God's children (<a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>). The idea of being God's offspring also aligns with Paul's message in Athens, where he addresses a diverse audience familiar with Greek philosophy, which often spoke of humanity's divine origin.<p><b>we should not think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone</b><br>Here, Paul challenges the prevalent idolatry of the time, where gods were often represented by physical idols made of precious materials. This echoes the Old Testament's condemnation of idol worship (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). The use of "gold or silver or stone" highlights the futility of equating the eternal, living God with inanimate objects. This teaching is consistent with the prophetic writings that denounce idols as powerless and man-made (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<p><b>an image formed by man&#8217;s skill and imagination</b><br>This phrase critiques the human tendency to create gods in their own image, using their creativity and craftsmanship. It underscores the biblical theme that God is beyond human comprehension and cannot be contained or represented by physical forms (<a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48-50</a>). The reference to "skill and imagination" points to the cultural practices of the time, where artisans crafted idols, a practice seen in various ancient civilizations. This critique aligns with the broader biblical narrative that calls for worship of the true God, who is spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, a prominent rock outcropping located northwest of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.
