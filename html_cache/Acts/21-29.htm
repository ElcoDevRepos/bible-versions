His presence with Paul highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel, breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>). Ephesus was a major city in the Roman province of Asia, and Trophimus's association with Paul underscores the missionary journeys that spread Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. The mention of Trophimus also connects to <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, where he is listed among Paul's companions, indicating his role in the early church's mission.<p><b>and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was a sacred place with strict regulations about who could enter. Gentiles were allowed only in the outer court, known as the Court of the Gentiles. Bringing a Gentile into the inner courts was considered a serious offense, punishable by death, as it violated Jewish law and customs. This assumption reflects the tension between Jewish traditions and the emerging Christian faith, which proclaimed that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The accusation against Paul echoes the charges against Jesus, who was also misunderstood and falsely accused (<a href="/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>).

Their prior sighting formed the only &#8220;evidence&#8221; they needed to stir a riot. Scripture repeatedly warns how preconceived notions breed false judgment&#8212;see <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a> and <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>. The text underscores that the accusers did not catch Paul in any wrongdoing; they relied on memory and suspicion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city</b><p>Trophimus was one of Paul&#8217;s Gentile companions listed in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>. A believer from pagan Ephesus, he embodied the gospel&#8217;s reach beyond Israel (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>). His mere presence in Jerusalem&#8217;s streets was lawful, yet his ethnicity made him an easy target for hostile Jews who clung to separations the gospel had already torn down (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). This contrast between law-keeping appearance and gospel reality echoes Peter&#8217;s earlier vision of clean and unclean (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple</b><p>The Temple&#8217;s Court of the Gentiles welcomed foreigners, but stone inscriptions threatened death for any Gentile who passed the inner barrier. Paul was charged with defiling the holy place&#8212;a capital offense under Jewish law (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). Yet the accusation rested on assumption alone; no witness saw Trophimus inside. Luke highlights the baseless nature of the charge to affirm Paul&#8217;s innocence (<a href="/acts/24-18.htm">Acts 24:18-19</a>). The hostility foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s universal offer clashing with entrenched tradition, just as Stephen faced similar fury (<a href="/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a> records a false accusation born of prejudice: Asian Jews, recalling Paul in public with his Gentile friend Trophimus, leapt to the conclusion that Paul desecrated the Temple. Their assumption&#8212;unsupported and unlawful&#8212;ignited the mob that led to Paul&#8217;s arrest. The verse showcases the danger of judging by appearance, the tension between old boundaries and the gospel&#8217;s inclusiveness, and God&#8217;s sovereign use of unjust charges to advance His plan, moving Paul toward Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Trophimus an Ephesian.</span>--See Note on <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>.
