In biblical times, physical ailments were often seen as a result of sin or divine judgment, yet this man's condition from birth suggests innocence and evokes compassion. His lifelong disability sets the stage for a miraculous healing, highlighting the power of God. This mirrors other biblical accounts of healing, such as the man born blind in <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, where Jesus clarifies that the condition was not due to sin but for the works of God to be displayed.<p><b>was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful</b><br>The Beautiful Gate is believed to be one of the gates leading into the temple complex in Jerusalem, possibly the Nicanor Gate, which was known for its grandeur and ornate design. This location is significant as it was a place of high traffic, ensuring the man would encounter many people. The temple was central to Jewish religious life, and being placed at its gate symbolizes the man's exclusion from full participation in worship due to his disability, as Levitical laws restricted the physically impaired from entering certain areas of the temple (<a href="/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17-23</a>).<p><b>where he was put every day to beg</b><br>Begging was a common practice for those with disabilities in ancient times, as there were limited means of support. The daily routine of being placed at the gate underscores the man's dependence on others and the community's role in his survival. This practice also reflects the social and economic challenges faced by the disabled, who relied on almsgiving, a key aspect of Jewish piety, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>, which encourages generosity towards the poor.<p><b>from those entering the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were a hub of religious activity, drawing Jews from various regions for prayer and sacrifice. Those entering the temple were likely to be in a charitable mindset, making it a strategic location for begging. This setting also foreshadows the encounter with Peter and John, who, as devout Jews, were entering for prayer. The temple courts symbolize a place of divine encounter, and the man's presence there sets the stage for a transformative miracle, aligning with the theme of God's presence bringing healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lame_man.htm">The Lame Man</a></b><br>A man who was lame from birth and was carried daily to the temple gate called Beautiful to beg for alms from those entering the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Two of Jesus' apostles who were going up to the temple at the time of prayer, around three in the afternoon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_gate_called_beautiful.htm">The Temple Gate Called Beautiful</a></b><br>A specific gate of the temple in Jerusalem where the lame man was placed to beg.

The latter was of fine Corinthian brass, so massive that twenty men were required to open or shut it (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 5, ? 3).<p><span class= "bld">To ask alms of them that entered into the temple.</span>--The approaches of the Temple, like those of modern mosques, were commonly thronged with the blind, lame, and other mendicants. (Comp. <a href="/john/9-8.htm" title="The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?">John 9:8</a>.) The practice was common at Constantinople in the time of Chrysostom, and has prevailed largely throughout Christendom. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- That was lame</span> for <span class="accented">lame</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">door</span> for <span class="accented">gate</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Door</span>. If any distinction is intended between the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> here and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> of ver. 10 (which is not certain, as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is often used for a <span class="accented">gate</span>), we must understand <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of the double doors of the gate described by Josephus. Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. <span class="cmt_word">Which is called Beautiful</span>. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as "the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court," following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up <span class="accented">from</span> the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. <span class="cmt_word">The temple</span>. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; the actual house was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; that part of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> to which only Israelites were admitted, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Josephus also divides the precincts into the first, second, and third <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The description of this lame man laid at the gate of the temple to ask alms is very similar to that in <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> of Lazarus laid at the rich man's gate; only that the word for <span class="accented">laid</span> is in St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
