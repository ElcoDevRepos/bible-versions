The term "brothers" reflects the common Jewish heritage and shared faith in the God of Israel. It also emphasizes the unity and continuity between the Old Covenant community and the emerging Christian community.<p><b>I know that you acted in ignorance,</b><br>Peter acknowledges that the actions of the people, specifically their role in the crucifixion of Jesus, were done without full understanding. This reflects a theme found in the Old Testament, where unintentional sins were treated differently from willful disobedience (<a href="/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>). It also aligns with Jesus' words on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). This ignorance does not absolve them of guilt but opens the door for repentance and forgiveness.<p><b>as did your leaders.</b><br>Peter includes the Jewish leaders in this statement, indicating that even those in positions of religious authority were unaware of the full implications of their actions. This highlights the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant is rejected by his own people. It also underscores the theme of spiritual blindness that Jesus often addressed in His ministry (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).

Men were ignorant where they might have known, if they had not allowed prejudice and passion to over-power the witness borne by reason and conscience. Their ignorance was not invincible, and therefore they needed to repent of what they had done in the times of that ignorance. But because it was ignorance, repentance was not impossible. Even the people and rulers of Israel, though their sin was greater, came within the range of the prayer, offered in the first instance for the Roman soldiers: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." (See Note on <a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.
