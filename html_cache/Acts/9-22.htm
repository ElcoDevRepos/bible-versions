This empowerment refers to the Holy Spirit's work in his life, enabling him to preach with authority and boldness. This transformation is significant, as Saul was previously a fierce persecutor of Christians. The empowerment is reminiscent of <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus promises the disciples power through the Holy Spirit. Saul's increasing strength in his mission highlights the transformative power of God's grace.<p><b>and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus</b><br>The Jews in Damascus were likely familiar with Saul's reputation as a persecutor of Christians, making his newfound zeal for Christ surprising and perplexing. The term "confounded" suggests that Saul's arguments were compelling and difficult to refute. Damascus was a significant city in the Roman province of Syria, with a substantial Jewish population. Saul's ability to confound them indicates his deep understanding of the Scriptures and his skill in using them to demonstrate the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>by proving that Jesus is the Christ</b><br>Saul's arguments were based on the Hebrew Scriptures, which he used to demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. This would have included references to passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describe the suffering servant and the crucifixion, respectively. Saul's method of proving Jesus as the Christ involved showing that Jesus' life, death, and resurrection were the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. This approach is consistent with the apostolic preaching found throughout the New Testament, where the focus is on Jesus as the promised Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Originally a zealous Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, Saul experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

Like the demoniac of <a href="/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>, Saul is instantly commissioned to testify.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was empowered all the more</b><p>- The Holy Spirit, who filled Saul at his baptism (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17-18</a>), keeps increasing his strength. The same wording appears of the early church in <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>, showing that growth in power is God-given, not self-generated.<p>- The pattern echoes <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>&#8212;where God&#8217;s servants receive fresh courage to match fresh opposition.<p>- Practical note: power comes as we obey, not before. Saul starts preaching and the Spirit supplies what he needs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus</b><p>- &#8220;Confounded&#8221; means they were left without an answer, similar to the priests silenced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-46.htm">Matthew 22:46</a>.<p>- Damascus&#8217; synagogue leaders had welcomed Saul as an ally (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>); now he dismantles their arguments. Like Stephen in <a href="/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a>, his wisdom is irresistible.<p>- Their confusion foreshadows later confrontations, such as in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> and <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>, reminding us that clear truth often meets clouded hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by proving that Jesus is the Christ</b><p>- Saul doesn&#8217;t rely on fiery rhetoric but on Scripture, aligning passages like <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, <a href="/bsb/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, and <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> with the factual resurrection (<a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32-37</a>).<p>- &#8220;Proving&#8221; is the same strategy Peter used in <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-36</a>; both root the gospel in fulfilled prophecy.<p>- Note the audience: devout, Scripture-saturated Jews. If they can grasp that Jesus fulfills messianic promises, everything else falls into place (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a> shows a freshly converted Saul immediately strengthened by the Spirit, overturning old alliances, and demonstrating from Scripture that Jesus is the promised Messiah.

A comparison of dates suggests the connection of this growth with the special vision of <a href="/2_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For this thing I sought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.">2Corinthians 12:8</a>, when in answer to his prayer that the infirmity which he describes as "a thorn in his flesh, the minister of Satan to buffet him," he received the comforting assurance from the Lord whom he served--"My strength is made perfect in weakness." It is not without interest that in after years St. Paul once and again uses the same verb of himself--"I can do all things in Christ that <span class= "ital">strengthened</span> me" (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm" title="I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.">Philippians 4:13</a>). It was Christ who "<span class= "ital">enabled</span> him," or, <span class= "ital">made him strong, </span>for his ministry (<a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>); who "<span class= "ital">strengthened</span> him" in the closing trials of his life (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2Timothy 4:17</a>).
