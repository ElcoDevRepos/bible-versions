His assumption reflects a common human tendency to expect others to see things from our perspective. This assumption can be linked to the broader biblical theme of misunderstanding God's plans, as seen in the lives of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). Moses' assumption also highlights the disconnect between his privileged upbringing and the plight of his people.<p><b>that God was using him to deliver them</b><br>Moses believed he was chosen by God to be a deliverer, a role that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate deliverer (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>). This belief may have been influenced by his unique position and education, which equipped him for leadership. The concept of deliverance is central to the biblical narrative, with God repeatedly raising leaders to rescue His people, as seen with the judges (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>) and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>).<p><b>but they did not</b><br>The rejection of Moses by his fellow Hebrews prefigures the rejection of Christ by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This phrase underscores a recurring biblical theme where God's chosen leaders are often not recognized or accepted by those they are sent to save. It also reflects the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that can prevent people from recognizing God's work, a theme echoed in the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>) and in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Moses stands in that line, trusting the God of Abraham to honor bold obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his brothers</b><p>- The focus is on family, not strangers. Moses identifies with the oppressed Hebrews rather than Egyptian privilege (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11</a>).<p>- &#8220;Brothers&#8221; echoes <a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>, where Joseph&#8217;s siblings likewise rejected a God-given deliverer. Stephen later ties both rejections together (<a href="/acts/7-9.htm">Acts 7:9, 27</a>).<p>- God consistently raises deliverance from within the covenant community&#8212;Samson (<a href="/judges/15-11.htm">Judges 15:11</a>), Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>), ultimately Christ &#8220;born of a woman, born under the Law&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>would understand</b><p>- Moses expected spiritual perception: that the signs of providence were obvious&#8212;his royal education, physical strength, and zeal.<p>- Yet fallen hearts often miss what God is doing (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>; <a href="/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>).

Stephen emphasizes national hardness to convict his hearers (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51-52</a>).<p>- God allows rejection to advance His timeline: Moses spends forty years in Midian, gaining humility and dependence (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). What seems a setback becomes preparation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25</a> shows Moses acting in faith, recognizing God&#8217;s call to rescue Israel.
