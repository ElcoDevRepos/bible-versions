The act of glorifying God is a common biblical response to witnessing His work and is seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>, <a href="/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>). It reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to bring salvation to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The leaders' reaction underscores the unity of purpose among early Christians, despite cultural and ethnic differences.<p><b>Then they said to Paul,</b><br>The leaders of the Jerusalem church, likely including James, the brother of Jesus, and other elders, address Paul directly. This interaction highlights the importance of communication and accountability within the early church. It also sets the stage for addressing potential conflicts between Jewish and Gentile believers, a recurring theme in Acts and Paul's epistles (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You see, brother,</b><br>The use of "brother" signifies the familial bond among believers, transcending ethnic and cultural divisions. This term of endearment reflects the early church's emphasis on unity in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). It also acknowledges Paul's Jewish heritage and his role as an apostle to the Gentiles, bridging the gap between Jewish and Gentile Christians.<p><b>how many thousands of Jews have believed,</b><br>The mention of "thousands" indicates the significant growth of the early church in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of a remnant of Israel turning to the Messiah (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). This growth is a testament to the power of the Holy Spirit at work since Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>). It also highlights the continued relevance of the gospel to the Jewish people, despite the church's expansion among the Gentiles.<p><b>and all of them are zealous for the law.</b><br>This phrase reflects the cultural and religious context of Jewish believers who maintained a strong commitment to the Mosaic Law. Their zeal is reminiscent of Paul's own former zeal for the law (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5-6</a>) and underscores the tension between adherence to Jewish customs and the new covenant in Christ. This tension is addressed in various New Testament writings, emphasizing the fulfillment of the law through faith in Jesus (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a>).

There is no trace of the presence of any of the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">They are all zealous of the law.</span>--Better, the word being a substantive and not an adjective, <span class= "ital">zealots for the law.</span> The term was an almost technical one for the most rigid class of Pharisees. (See Note on Simon the Canaanite, <a href="/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>.) So St. Paul describes himself as in this sense a "zealot" (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm" title="And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.">Galatians 1:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- They, when they heard it</span> for <span class="accented">when they heard it, they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they said</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there are among the Jews of them which have believed</span> for <span class="accented">of Jews there are which believe</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">for the Law</span> for <span class="accented">of the Law</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They... glorified God</span>. There is not the slightest symptom on the part of James and the elders of unfriendliness towards St. Paul, or jealousy or opposition to his work among the Gentiles (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>). The appellation <span class="cmt_word">brother</span> is another indication of friendly feeling. <span class="cmt_word">Thousands</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, tens of thousands). These need not be deemed to be all Jerusalem Jews; if applied to the Church at Jerusalem only, such a word would be probably a gross exaggeration; but there were great numbers of Jews of the dispersion assembled at Jerusalem for Pentecost - probably all the Christian Jews of Judaea, and many from Syria, Galatia, Pontus, and the various countries enumerated in <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-11</a>. So that there might be several myriads of converted Jews altogether. <span class="cmt_word">All zealous for the Law</span>. This is a remarkable testimony to the unanimity of the Christian Jews in their attachment to the Law of Moses, and throws light upon the Epistle to the Galatians and many other passages in St. Paul's Epistles. It explains the great difficulty experienced in the early Church in dealing with converts from Judaism. <span class="accented">Zealous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>). So the fierce sect of Zealots were called at the time of the Jewish wars (see Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 4. 6:1, and elsewhere). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When they heard [this],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
