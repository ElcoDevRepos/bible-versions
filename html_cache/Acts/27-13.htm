In biblical symbolism, wind often represents the Spirit of God or divine intervention, but here it is simply a natural occurrence. The south wind is mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a> and <a href="/luke/12-55.htm">Luke 12:55</a>, often associated with warmth and calmness. This gentle wind gave the sailors a false sense of security, which can be seen as a metaphor for relying on human judgment rather than divine guidance.<p><b>they thought they had their opportunity</b><br>The sailors and those on board, including Paul, believed that the favorable wind provided the right conditions to continue their journey. This reflects human tendency to interpret circumstances based on immediate appearances rather than seeking deeper wisdom or divine insight. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be seen as a caution against presumption and overconfidence, reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which speaks to the plans of man versus the direction of the Lord.<p><b>So they weighed anchor and sailed along</b><br>Weighing anchor signifies a commitment to a course of action, a decision to move forward. In the context of Acts, this decision was made despite Paul's earlier warning about the dangers of the voyage (<a href="/acts/27-10.htm">Acts 27:10</a>). This action can be paralleled with moments in scripture where individuals or groups proceed with their plans without heeding divine warnings, such as the Israelites' decision to enter the Promised Land against God's command in <a href="/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>.<p><b>hugging the coast of Crete</b><br>Crete is a significant location in the New Testament, known for its challenging sailing conditions due to its geographical position in the Mediterranean. The decision to sail close to the coast was likely a strategy to avoid the open sea's dangers, reflecting a cautious approach. Crete is also mentioned in <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>, where Paul instructs Titus to appoint elders in every town, indicating the island's importance in early Christian mission work. The mention of Crete here underscores the challenges faced by early Christians in spreading the Gospel amidst natural and human obstacles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported as a prisoner to Rome.

The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; External calm is not the same as divine approval.<p>&#8226; Decisions rooted in human logic, even expert logic, must bow to God&#8217;s revealed wisdom.<p>&#8226; True security lies not in favorable winds or nearby shores but in trusting the Lord who commands the seas.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And when the south wind blew softly.</span>--There was a change at once in the force and the direction of the wind. With a gentle and favourable breeze from the south, the pilot and the owner thought that all was smooth sailing, and the ship left the Fair Havens and made across the bay, a distance of thirty-four miles, for Phaenice. They still, however, hugged the coast, as afraid to venture too far into the open sea. The Greek adverb <span class= "ital">asson, </span>which is rightly rendered "close" in the Authorised version, has been mistaken, in the Vulgate and some other versions, for the accusative case of <span class= "ital">Assos, </span>as though it were a proper name, and the words have been variously rendered "when they had left Assos," or "when they had made for Asses," or "when they had come in sight of Assos." The island Assos, however, lay far to the north (see Note on <a href="/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>), and there is no evidence of the existence of any town of that name in Crete. Of the English versions, Wiclif and the Rhemish follow the Vulgate, "when they had removed" (W.), or "parted" (Rh.), "from Assos"; Tyndale and Cranmer, following Luther, "they loosed unto Asson." The Geneva translation was the first to give the true meaning, and is following by the Authorised version. The tense of the Greek verb for "they sailed close," implies that they were in the act of doing this when the storm burst upon them, as in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- They weighed anchor and</span> for <span class="accented">loosing thence, they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">along Crete, close in shore</span> for <span class="accented">close by Crete</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Blew softly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the New Testament, and not found elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Supposing that they had obtained their purpose</span>.
