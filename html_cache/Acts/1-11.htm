Galilee was a region in northern Israel, known for its diverse population and as a center of Jesus' early ministry. The term underscores the disciples' identity and their role as witnesses to Jesus' life and teachings. It also connects to <a href="/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7</a>, where the crowd recognizes the disciples as Galileans, highlighting their distinct accent and background.<p><b>&#8220;why do you stand here looking into the sky?</b><br>This question challenges the disciples' focus and redirects their attention from passive observation to active mission. The sky, or heavens, often symbolizes the divine realm in biblical literature. The disciples' gaze upward reflects their awe and perhaps confusion at Jesus' ascension. The question implies that their mission is not to remain idle but to prepare for the work Jesus has set before them, as outlined in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where they are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth.<p><b>This same Jesus,</b><br>The phrase "this same Jesus" emphasizes the continuity of Jesus' identity and mission. It reassures the disciples that the Jesus they knew, who taught, healed, and was crucified, is the same one who ascended and will return. This continuity is crucial for the early church's understanding of Jesus' nature and the fulfillment of His promises. It connects to <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>, which states that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, affirming His unchanging nature.<p><b>who has been taken from you into heaven,</b><br>The ascension marks Jesus' return to the Father and the completion of His earthly ministry. It signifies His exaltation and the beginning of His heavenly reign. The phrase "taken from you" indicates a divine action, emphasizing God's sovereignty in Jesus' ascension. This event fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at God's right hand, and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which describes the Son of Man receiving authority and glory.<p><b>will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven.&#8221;</b><br>This promise of Jesus' return is a cornerstone of Christian eschatology, affirming the belief in the Second Coming. The phrase "in the same way" suggests a visible, bodily return, paralleling His ascension. This expectation is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, which describes the Lord's return with a commanding shout and the gathering of believers. The promise of His return provides hope and motivation for the church to live faithfully and carry out its mission until that day.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_galilee.htm">Men of Galilee</a></b><br>Refers to the disciples of Jesus who were from the region of Galilee.

Rather than gazing idly into the heavens, we live expectantly, proclaiming the gospel in the power of the Spirit, confident that the Lord who went up will soon come down to reign forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</span>--So our Lord, following the great prophecy of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, had spoken of Himself as "coming in the clouds of heaven" (see Note on <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>), in visible 'majesty and glory. Here, again, men have asked questions which they cannot answer; not only, when shall the end be, but where shall the Judge thus appear? what place shall be the chosen scene of His second Advent? So far as we dare to localise what is left undefined, the words of the angels suggest the same scene, as well as the same manner. Those who do not shrink from taking the words of prophecy in their most literal sense, have seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.">Zechariah 14:4</a>, an intimation that the Valley of Jehosophat (= Jehovah judges)--the "valley of decision"--shall witness the great Assize, and that the feet of the Judge shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, from which He had ascended into heaven. This was the current mediaeval view, and seems, if we are to localise at all, to be more probable than any other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Looking</span> for <span class="accented">gazing up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">this same</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was received</span> for is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beheld</span> <span class="accented">him going</span> for <span class="accented">have seen him go</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In like manner</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a cloud.

We are reminded of the grand imagery of <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, "Who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind." It may be remarked that the above is by far the fullest account we have of the ascension of our Lord. St. Luke appears to have learnt some further particulars concerning it in the interval between writing his Gospel (<a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50-52</a>) and writing the Acts. But allusions to the Ascension are frequent (<a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8, 9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>, etc.). With reference to Zeller's assertion, that in St. <span class="accented">Luke's</span> Gospel the Ascension is represented as taking place on the day of the Resurrection, it may freely be admitted that the narrative in the Gospel does not mark distinctly the interval of time between the different appearances and discourses of our Lord from the day of the Resurrection to that of the Ascension. It seems to group them according to their logical connection rather than according to their chronological sequence, and to be a general account of what Jesus said between the Resurrection and the Ascension. But there is nothing whatever in the text of St. Luke to indicate that what is related in the section Luke 24:44-49 took place at the same time as the things related in the preceding verses. And when we compare with that section what is contained in <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it becomes clear that it did not. Because the words "assembling together with them," in ver. 4, clearly indicate a different occasion from the apparitions on the day of the Resurrection; and as the words in <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-49</a> correspond with those in <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it must have been also on a different occasion that they were spoken. Again, the narrative of St. John, both in the twentieth and the twenty-first chapters, as well as that of <a href="/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10, 16</a>; <a href="/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>, precludes the possibility of the Ascension having taken place, or having been thought to have taken place, on the day of the Resurrection, or for many days after, so that to force a meaning upon the last chapter of St. Luke's Gospel which it does not necessarily bear, and which places it at variance with St. Luke's own account in the Acts (Acts 1:3; 13:31), and with the Church traditions as preserved by St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. John, is a violent and willful transaction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Men</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Andres)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
