Tanning was considered an unclean profession by Jewish standards due to the handling of dead animals, which makes Peter's stay significant. It demonstrates the breaking down of Jewish purity laws and foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith. This setting highlights Peter's openness to God's leading, preparing him for the vision he receives and his subsequent visit to Cornelius, a Gentile.<p><b>whose house is by the sea</b><br>Joppa, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, is the location of Simon the tanner's house. The proximity to the sea is practical for a tanner, as water was essential for the tanning process. This geographical detail underscores the historical accuracy of the account. Joppa is also significant in biblical history as the port from which Jonah attempted to flee from God's command. The mention of the sea may symbolize the expansive reach of the Gospel, as Peter's vision and subsequent actions lead to the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling the Great Commission to go into all the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, described as a devout and God-fearing man who prayed regularly and gave generously to those in need.
