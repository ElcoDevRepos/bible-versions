Sorcery was often associated with deception and manipulation, contrasting with the truth of the Gospel. The name "Elymas" is likely derived from an Arabic or Aramaic word meaning "wise," suggesting he was considered a wise man or magician. This reflects the cultural context where such figures held influence and were often consulted by leaders.<p><b>(for that is what his name means)</b><br>The parenthetical explanation clarifies that "Elymas" is a title or description rather than a personal name, emphasizing his role and identity as a practitioner of magic. This detail highlights the biblical practice of revealing the true nature of individuals through their names, as seen in other scriptural examples like Simon the Sorcerer in <a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9-24</a>.<p><b>opposed them</b><br>Elymas actively resisted Paul and Barnabas, who were preaching the Gospel. This opposition is a recurring theme in Acts, where the spread of Christianity often meets resistance from those with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. The spiritual battle between truth and deception is evident here, as Elymas seeks to hinder the apostles' mission.<p><b>and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.</b><br>The proconsul, Sergius Paulus, was a Roman official, indicating the Gospel's reach into influential circles. Elymas's attempt to turn him from the faith underscores the threat the Gospel posed to existing power structures and belief systems. This mirrors other biblical accounts where leaders are influenced by spiritual advisors, such as Pharaoh's magicians in Exodus. The proconsul's interest in the faith suggests a divine appointment, as God often places seekers in positions to hear the truth, aligning with the broader narrative of God's sovereignty in salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elymas_the_sorcerer.htm">Elymas the Sorcerer</a></b><br>Also known as Bar-Jesus, Elymas is a Jewish false prophet and magician who opposes Paul and Barnabas.
