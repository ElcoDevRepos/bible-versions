These words are recorded in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus commissions His followers to be His witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This command sets the stage for the spread of the Gospel and the establishment of the early Church. It emphasizes the importance of the Great Commission and the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers.<p><b>they watched</b><br>The disciples were eyewitnesses to the ascension, which underscores the historical reality of the event. This act of watching signifies their role as witnesses, a theme that is central to the Book of Acts. The presence of multiple witnesses adds credibility to the account, as Jewish law required two or three witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>as He was taken up</b><br>The ascension of Jesus is a pivotal moment in Christian theology, marking the conclusion of His earthly ministry and His exaltation to the right hand of the Father. This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at God's right hand. The ascension also signifies Jesus' victory over sin and death and His authority over all creation.<p><b>and a cloud hid Him from their sight</b><br>The cloud is a significant biblical symbol, often representing the presence and glory of God. In the Old Testament, a cloud led the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and filled the temple with God's glory (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The cloud at the ascension connects Jesus to these divine manifestations, indicating His divine nature and the approval of the Father. This imagery also points to the promise of His return, as described in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> and reiterated by the angels in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who is taken up into heaven.

For every believer, this verse calls for watchful obedience, firm hope in Christ&#8217;s exaltation, and eager expectation of His coming again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He was taken up; and a cloud received him . . .</span>--It is remarkable how little stress is laid in the Gospels on the fact which has always been so prominent in the creeds of Christendom. Neither St. John nor St. Matthew record it. It is barely mentioned with utmost brevity in the verses which close the Gospel of St. Mark, and in which many critics see, indeed, a fragment of apostolic teaching, but not part of the original Gospel. The reasons of this silence are, however, not far to seek. It was because the Ascension was from the first part of the creed of Christendom that the Evangelists said so little. The fact had been taught to every catechumen. They would not embellish it--as, for example, the Assumption of the Virgin was embellished in later legends--by fantastic details. That it was so received is clear. It is implied in our Lord's language, as recorded by St. John, "What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?" (<a href="/john/6-62.htm" title="What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?">John 6:62</a>), and such words would hardly have been brought before believers at the close of the apostolic age if they had received no fulfilment. It is assumed in the earliest form of the Church's creed, "He was received up into glory," the verb being identical with that which St. Luke employs in St. Peter's speeches (<a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>), and in St. Paul's epistles (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>). We may add that there was something like a moral necessity, assuming the Resurrection as a fact, for such a conclusion to our Lord's work on earth. Two other alternatives may, perhaps, be just imagined as possible: He might, like Lazarus, have lived out His restored life to its appointed term, and then died the common death of all men; but in that case where would have been the victory over death, and the witness that He was the Son of Man? He might have lived on an endless life on earth; but in this case, being such as He was, conflict, persecution, and suffering would have come again and again at every stage, and in each instance a miracle would have been needed to save the suffering from passing on to death, or many deaths must have been followed by many resurrections. When we seek, however, to realise the process of the Ascension, we find ourselves in a region of thought in which it is not easy to move freely. With our thoughts of the relations of the earth to space and the surrounding orbs, we find it hard to follow that upward motion, and to ask what was its direction and where it terminated. We cannot get beyond the cloud; but that cloud was the token of the glory of the Eternal Presence, as the Shechinah that of old filled the Temple (<a href="/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10-11</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>), and it is enough for us to know that where God is there also is Christ, in the glory of the Father, retaining still, though under new conditions and laws, the human nature which made Him like unto His brethren. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Said</span> for <span class="accented">spoken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as they were looking</span> for <span class="accented">while they beheld</span>, A.V.
