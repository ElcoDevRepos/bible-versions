This moment of reflection indicates Peter's struggle to understand the radical shift in God's plan. The vision's timing is significant, as it occurs during a period of early church expansion and the breaking down of Jewish-Gentile barriers. This reflection is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant, where the gospel is for all people.<p><b>the Spirit said to him</b><br>The Holy Spirit's direct communication with Peter underscores the Spirit's active role in guiding the early church. This divine guidance is consistent with the promise Jesus made in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, where He assured the disciples that the Spirit of truth would lead them into all truth. The Spirit's involvement here emphasizes the importance of divine revelation in understanding and implementing God's will, especially in matters that challenge existing cultural and religious norms.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, three men are looking for you.</b><br>The mention of "three men" refers to the emissaries sent by Cornelius, a Roman centurion, who was instructed by an angel to seek Peter. This encounter is significant as it marks the first recorded instance of a Gentile household receiving the Holy Spirit, as detailed later in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology, suggesting the completeness of God's plan for salvation to extend beyond the Jewish people.
