The context is the early church in Jerusalem, where believers were selling possessions and sharing the proceeds. Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property but kept back part of the money while pretending to donate the full amount. This act of deception was not just against the apostles but against the Holy Spirit, highlighting the seriousness of lying to God.<p><b>Ananias fell down and died</b><br>The sudden death of Ananias serves as a divine judgment and a warning to the early church about the holiness and purity required in the community of believers. This event underscores the seriousness of sin, particularly hypocrisy and deceit within the church. It parallels Old Testament instances where God's immediate judgment was executed, such as the deaths of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). It also foreshadows the final judgment where all will be held accountable for their actions.<p><b>And great fear came over all</b><br>The fear that spread among the people was a reverent awe and recognition of God's holiness and justice. This fear was not just terror but a profound respect for the power and presence of God within the church. It served to purify the community and deter others from similar deceitful actions. This fear is akin to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>who heard what had happened</b><br>The news of Ananias's death spread quickly among the believers and the wider community, serving as a powerful testimony to the reality and seriousness of God's presence among His people. This event would have reinforced the authority of the apostles and the divine nature of the church's mission.

The apostle&#8217;s words exposed a deliberate deception, not a mere accounting error. Scripture records other moments when God&#8217;s word unmasked sin instantly&#8212;think of Nathan&#8217;s rebuke to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) or Jesus&#8217; insight into the Samaritan woman&#8217;s past (<a href="/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17-18</a>). <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> reminds us that &#8220;the word of God is living and active&#8230; able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; Here, that judging word arrived through Peter, leaving no room for excuse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ananias fell down and died</b><p>The sentence was immediate and physical&#8212;literal, not symbolic. Just as Nadab and Abihu were struck down for unauthorized fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and Uzzah died for touching the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>), Ananias faced divine judgment for treating God&#8217;s holiness lightly. In <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> Paul tells the church that &#8220;many are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep&#8221; because they abused the Lord&#8217;s Supper. These episodes confirm that the Lord reserves the right to guard His holiness with decisive action. For the early church, this moment underscored that grace never nullifies God&#8217;s righteous standards (<a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And great fear came over all who heard what had happened</b><p>The effect was widespread, reaching beyond the witnesses to anyone who heard the report. <a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a> notes an earlier surge of &#8220;awe&#8221; after Pentecost, and <a href="/acts/19-17.htm">Acts 19:17</a> describes a later outpouring of &#8220;fear&#8221; when the name of Jesus was magnified in Ephesus. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> teaches, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,&#8221; and this healthy reverence guarded the church from hypocrisy, fostering sincerity, unity, and power (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>). Far from driving believers away, godly fear deepened their commitment, while warning outsiders that God&#8217;s community is not to be trifled with.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-5.htm">Acts 5:5</a> shows the Lord&#8217;s immediate, righteous response to deliberate deception within His church. Peter&#8217;s Spirit-filled words pierced Ananias&#8217;s heart; God&#8217;s judgment fell on the spot; and the resulting fear purified and strengthened the believing community. The verse reminds us that the same holy God who pours out grace also demands integrity, calling His people to walk in transparent, wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Ananias hearing these words fell down.</span>--It is to be noted that St. Peter's words, while they press home the intensity of the guilt, do not contain any formal sentence. In such a case we may rightly trace that union of natural causation and divine purpose which we express in the familiar phrase that speaks of "the visitation of God" as a cause of death. The shame and agony of detection, the horror of conscience not yet dead, were enough to paralyse the powers of life. Retribution is not less a divine act because it comes, through the working of divine laws, as the natural consequence of the sin which draws it down. It was necessary, we may reverently say, that this special form of evil, this worst corruption of the best, should be manifestly condemned on its first appearance by a divine judgment. And we must remember that there is a silence which we may not dare to break as to all but the visible judgment. The dominant apostolic idea of such punishments was that men were delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>). St. Peter himself speaks of those who are "judged according to men in the flesh," who yet "live according to God in the spirit" (<a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Upon all that heard it</span> for on <span class="accented">all them that heard these things</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Gave up the ghost</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>).
