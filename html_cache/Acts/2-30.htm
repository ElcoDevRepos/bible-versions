Because prophecy comes &#8220;by men carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>), the words David penned carry divine authority. That authority anchors Peter&#8217;s argument that the resurrection and enthronement of Jesus are not clever ideas but foretold realities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and knew that God had promised him</b><p>David lived with confident awareness of a personal covenant from God. The Lord had already spoken through Nathan, &#8220;I will raise up your offspring after you&#8230; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>). David internalized this promise, celebrating it in <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3&#8211;4</a> and <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>.

Without them the sentence, though somewhat incomplete, would run thus: "That God had sworn with an oath <span class= "ital">that from his loins one should sit upon his throne."</span> The words claim for the Psalmist a prophetic foresight of some kind, without defining its measure or clearness. His thoughts went beyond himself to the realisation of his hopes in a near or far-off future. As with most other prophets, the precise time, even the "manner of time," was hidden from him (<a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He would raise up Christ.</span>--The Greek, by using the verb from which comes the word "resurrection," gives to the verb the definite sense of "raising from the dead."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Being therefore</span> for <span class="accented">therefore being</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that of the fruit of his loins he would set one upon</span> for <span class="accented">that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Had sworn</span>, etc. The first record of God's promise to David is in <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>: "The Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

Thy throne shall be established forever;" and in ver. 28, David speaks of it as God's promise: "Thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant." But there is no mention there of an oath. But in <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, "Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David" <a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, should be read through carefully (comp. also <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>).
