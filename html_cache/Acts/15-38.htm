His decision here reflects his commitment to the mission and the importance of reliability in ministry. This moment highlights the tension between grace and accountability within the church. Paul's judgment can be seen as prioritizing the mission's success over personal relationships, emphasizing the need for dependable partners in ministry. This decision also sets the stage for the eventual reconciliation and growth of John Mark, illustrating the redemptive potential within the Christian community.<p><b>because he had deserted them in Pamphylia</b><br>Pamphylia was a region in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where Paul and Barnabas had previously ministered. John Mark's departure from them in this region is recorded in <a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>, where he left the missionary journey to return to Jerusalem. This act of desertion was significant enough to cause Paul to question John Mark's commitment. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on loyalty and perseverance, especially in the face of hardship. This incident serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by early missionaries and the importance of steadfastness in the faith.<p><b>and had not accompanied them in the work</b><br>The "work" refers to the missionary efforts of spreading the Gospel, which involved preaching, teaching, and establishing churches. This was a demanding task that required dedication and resilience. By not accompanying them, John Mark missed the opportunity to contribute to this foundational period of church history. This phrase underscores the importance of active participation in ministry and the impact of one's absence on the collective mission. It also foreshadows John Mark's later contributions, as he eventually becomes a valuable asset to the early church, illustrating the theme of redemption and growth in Christian service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and theological contributions to Christianity.

The verse opens with a deliberate decision: &#8220;But Paul thought it best...&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s judgment was not impulsive; it followed prayer, past experience, and counsel (compare <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2, 6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays prudence in ministry partnerships&#8212;see <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>; <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>.<p>&#8226;

The concern was not personal dislike but stewardship of the gospel journey (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s refusal here mirrored his later instructions about appointing leaders with proven faithfulness (<a href="/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6, 10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because he had deserted them in Pamphylia</b><p>&#8226; Luke reminds readers of a prior incident: John Mark &#8220;left them and returned to Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;deserted&#8221; signals a serious breach of trust, echoed in <a href="/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>: &#8220;Many a man proclaims his loving devotion, but who can find a trustworthy man?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pamphylia had been rugged territory; abandoning the team then jeopardized the mission (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Past failures need honest acknowledgment before restoration can occur (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had not accompanied them in the work</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul valued reliability so highly that he would later commend Timothy with similar wording: &#8220;he has served with me in the work of the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; John Mark&#8217;s absence left a gap; the lesson is that every believer&#8217;s contribution counts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a> records Paul&#8217;s prudent decision to exclude John Mark from the next journey because Mark had previously abandoned the team and the task. The verse teaches that faithfulness is essential in ministry, discernment protects the mission, and past failures must be addressed before trust is restored. Later reconciliation (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>) shows that, while accountability is necessary, grace can still write a new chapter for those willing to prove themselves faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Take with them him</span> for <span class="accented">take him with them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">withdrew</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Withdrew</span>. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (from which comes the substantive <span class="accented">apostasy</span>) is a strong one, and denotes decided blame, as does the indication of the opposite course, by way of contrast, which he did not take. "He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. "Paul thought good," as regards one who had turned back from the work, "not <span class="accented">to take</span> that man." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the <span class="accented">ipsis-sima verba</span> of the "sharp contention." One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Paul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
