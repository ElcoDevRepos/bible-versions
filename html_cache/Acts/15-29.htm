Eating such food was seen as participating in idol worship, which was strictly forbidden in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>). Paul later addresses this issue in <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>, emphasizing the importance of not causing others to stumble in their faith. The Jerusalem Council's directive here reflects a desire to maintain purity and avoid syncretism with pagan practices.<p><b>from blood</b><br>The prohibition against consuming blood dates back to the Noahic covenant (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>) and is reiterated in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>). Blood was considered sacred as it represented life, and consuming it was seen as a violation of God's commands. This directive would have been particularly relevant in a context where pagan rituals often involved the consumption of blood.<p><b>from the meat of strangled animals</b><br>Strangled animals would still have blood in their bodies, making their meat unclean according to Jewish dietary laws. This prohibition aligns with the broader biblical theme of respecting life and the sanctity of blood. It also served to distinguish the early Christian community from surrounding pagan practices, which often disregarded such concerns.<p><b>and from sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality, or "porneia" in Greek, encompasses a range of illicit sexual behaviors condemned in both the Old and New Testaments. In the context of the early church, this would include practices common in pagan worship, such as temple prostitution. The call to abstain from sexual immorality is a consistent biblical theme, emphasizing holiness and the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>).<p><b>You will do well to avoid these things</b><br>This phrase suggests that adherence to these guidelines would lead to spiritual well-being and community harmony. It reflects the pastoral concern of the Jerusalem Council for the unity of Jewish and Gentile believers, ensuring that Gentile converts would not offend Jewish sensibilities or violate God's commands.<p><b>Farewell</b><br>The closing of the letter is brief and formal, typical of ancient correspondence. It signifies the end of the council's decree and conveys a sense of peace and goodwill. The use of "farewell" underscores the council's desire for the recipients to receive the message with grace and to live in accordance with the outlined instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jerusalem_council.htm">The Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A pivotal meeting of early church leaders, including apostles and elders, held in Jerusalem to address the issue of whether Gentile converts to Christianity must follow Jewish law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early church who advocated for the inclusion of Gentiles without the requirement of circumcision or adherence to the full Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/james,_the_brother_of_jesus.htm">James, the brother of Jesus</a></b><br>A leading figure in the Jerusalem church who played a significant role in the council's decision, offering a compromise that balanced Jewish traditions with the new faith of Gentile believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish converts to Christianity who were at the center of the debate regarding the necessity of following Jewish customs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>The city where the letter containing the council's decision was sent, serving as a major center for early Christianity and a hub for missionary activity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity_and_unity.htm">Cultural Sensitivity and Unity</a></b><br>The decision of the Jerusalem Council highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and unity within the body of Christ.

By taking these words literally and living them out, Christians honor Christ, bless one another, and shine brightly in a world still entangled in idols.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">From meats offered to idols.</span>--The specific term takes the place of the more general word which St. James had used. The change, if the two words were not used, as is possible, as altogether equivalent, may be thought of as favouring the Gentiles by narrowing the prohibition to a single point.<p><span class= "bld">Fare ye well.</span>--The closing salutation was, like the opening, a Greek and not a Hebrew one. It meets us again in <a href="/acts/23-30.htm" title="And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.">Acts 23:30</a>. Both were naturally used in a letter addressed to Greeks, and intended to be read by them and by Hellenistic Jews. It does not occur, however, in any of the Epistles of the New Testament.<p>It is natural to ask, at the close of the great encyclical letter, in what relation it really stood to the life of the Apostolic Church. As a <span class= "ital">concordat</span> between the contending parties it was framed, as has been said, with a sagacity that may well be looked on as inspired. But obviously it was not, and from the nature of the case could not be, more than that. The time had not come for proclaiming to the Church of Jerusalem the full width of St. Paul's teaching (<a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>), and accordingly, though something may be read between the lines, the decree seems to treat the precepts of Noah as perpetually binding, places moral and positive obligations on the same footing, and leaves the ground on which they are "necessary" an open question. St. Paul, who had accepted it as a satisfactory settlement of the matter in debate, never refers to it, even when he is discussing the chief point with which the decree dealt (1 Corinthians 8-10). In his narrative of what passed on this occasion (<a href="/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1-10</a>) there is no mention of it. The private conference with the three great "pillars" of the Church was for him more than the decree of the synod, and he felt himself able to discuss the whole question again on different grounds, and with a more distinct reference to spiritual and ethical principles. It was wrong to eat things sacrificed to idols, not because the act of so eating in itself brought defilement, but because it might involve a participation in the sin of idolatry in the consciousness of the eater, or wound the conscience of the weaker brother who saw him eat. It was natural that those who lacked his largeness of view should become slaves to the letter of the rules long after the grounds on which they rested had ceased to exist, and so we find that the prohibition of blood was re-enforced in the so-called Apostolic Canons (c. 62), and in the fourth century by the Council of Gangra (c. 2), and in the seventh by that at Constantinople, known as <span class= "ital">in Trullo</span> (c. 67), and continues to be the binding rule of the Greek Church still. In Africa and in Europe, however, truer views prevailed (August, <span class= "ital">cont. Faust.</span> xxxii. 13), and not even the most devout believer in the inspiration of the Apostles, or in the authority of primitive antiquity. would venture to urge that the two last precepts of the four here enjoined were in any degree binding. Hooker (<span class= "ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> iv., xi., ? 5) rightly refers to this decree as a crucial instance proving that commands might be divine and yet given only for a season, binding as long as the conditions to which they applied continued, but no longer. It would almost seem, indeed, as if St. Paul felt that the terms of the decree had the effect of placing the sin of impurity on the same level with that of eating things sacrificed to idols, and things strangled, and blood, and so tended to keep men from seeing it in its true hatefulness. Those who claimed a right, which in the abstract St. Paul could not deny, to eat of things strangled or offered to idols, thought themselves free to fall back into the old license of the heathen world, and he needed far stronger motives than the canons of the council to restrain them (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1Corinthians 5:9-10</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15-20</a>, and found those motives in the truths that they had been bought with a price, that the will of God was their sanctification, and that their bodies were His temple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> <span class="accented">- Things sacrificed</span> for <span class="accented">meats offered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">it shall be well with you</span> for <span class="accented">ye shall do well</span>, A.V.
