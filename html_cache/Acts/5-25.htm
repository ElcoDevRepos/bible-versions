The context is the aftermath of the apostles' miraculous release from prison by an angel. The announcement highlights the divine intervention that defied human authority. In biblical narratives, messengers often bring pivotal news, reminiscent of angelic announcements in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Look, the men you put in jail</b><br>The phrase underscores the irony and power of God&#8217;s intervention. The apostles, imprisoned for preaching about Jesus, are now free, emphasizing the futility of human efforts against God's will. This echoes <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where God laughs at the plans of earthly rulers. The apostles' imprisonment reflects the early church's persecution, a theme prevalent in Acts.<p><b>are standing in the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were central to Jewish religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The apostles' presence there signifies their boldness and commitment to proclaiming the Gospel in the heart of Judaism. This location is significant, as it was the same place where Jesus taught (<a href="/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>) and where early believers gathered (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>).<p><b>teaching the people!&#8221;</b><br>Teaching was a primary function of the apostles, fulfilling Jesus' Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Their teaching in the temple courts demonstrates their obedience to God over human authorities (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). This act of teaching also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, where the word of the Lord goes forth from Jerusalem, highlighting the spread of the Gospel from its Jewish roots to the wider world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage, who were previously imprisoned for preaching about Jesus but are now found teaching in the temple courts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_courts.htm">The Temple Courts</a></b><br>A significant location in Jerusalem where the apostles were teaching.

This simple report contrasts human confinement with God&#8217;s liberation, reminding us of <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where the Lord laughs at futile human resistance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;
