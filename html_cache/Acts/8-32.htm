This highlights the spread of Jewish scriptures beyond Israel, indicating the influence of Judaism in the ancient world. The eunuch's ability to read suggests he was educated and had access to religious texts, which were not commonly available to everyone at the time.<p><b>&#8220;He was led like a sheep to the slaughter:</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, a prophetic passage often referred to as the "Suffering Servant." It is widely interpreted as a prophecy about Jesus Christ, who was led to His crucifixion willingly, like a sheep to slaughter. The imagery of a sheep is significant in Jewish culture, symbolizing innocence and sacrifice, as seen in the Passover lamb.<p><b>and as a lamb before the shearer is silent:</b><br>The lamb's silence before the shearer reflects Jesus' demeanor during His trial and crucifixion. Despite the false accusations and suffering, Jesus did not defend Himself, fulfilling the prophecy of His silent submission. This silence is a powerful testament to His obedience to God's will and His role as the sacrificial Lamb.<p><b>so He did not open His mouth:</b><br>This emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy through His quiet acceptance of suffering and death. It connects to the New Testament accounts of Jesus' trial, where He remained silent before His accusers (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>, <a href="/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3-5</a>).
