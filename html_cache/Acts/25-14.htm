The duration of their stay suggests an opportunity for Festus to discuss matters of governance and legal cases, including Paul's situation. The setting is significant as it provides a backdrop for the unfolding of God's plan for Paul to testify before kings, as foretold in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>.<p><b>Festus laid out Paul&#8217;s case before the king</b><br>Festus, the Roman governor, seeks counsel from King Agrippa II, who is familiar with Jewish customs and laws. This reflects the Roman practice of consulting local authorities on matters involving regional customs. The involvement of Agrippa, a Herodian king, highlights the intersection of Roman and Jewish authority. This moment fulfills Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12-13</a> about His followers being brought before kings and governors for His name's sake.<p><b>There is a certain man</b><br>This phrase introduces Paul in a manner that underscores his significance in the narrative. Paul, once a persecutor of Christians, is now a central figure in the spread of the Gospel. His transformation and mission are pivotal in the early church's history, as seen in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-22</a>. The phrase also reflects Festus's attempt to present the case objectively to Agrippa.<p><b>whom Felix left in prison</b><br>Felix, the previous governor, had kept Paul imprisoned for two years, hoping for a bribe (<a href="/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26-27</a>). This highlights the political corruption and injustice Paul faced. Felix's decision to leave Paul in prison upon his departure was likely a political move to appease the Jewish leaders. This situation sets the stage for Paul's appeal to Caesar, aligning with God's purpose for him to witness in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/festus.htm">Festus</a></b><br>The Roman governor who succeeded Felix.

During this pause:<p>&#8226; Festus could ponder the unresolved Jewish complaints (<a href="/acts/25-2.htm">Acts 25:2-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul remained safely in custody, sheltered from the plots that had followed him since Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God created space for His promise that Paul would testify &#8220;before kings&#8221; to unfold (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; 23:11).<p>Just as <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> affirms the Lord&#8217;s control over rulers&#8217; hearts, these extra days show His quiet sovereignty over every schedule, ensuring His servant&#8217;s story reached the right ears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Festus Laid Out Paul&#8217;s Case Before the King</b><p>Roman procedure required clarity before a prisoner could be forwarded to Caesar (<a href="/acts/25-25.htm">Acts 25:25-27</a>). Festus, new to the region and its religious disputes, saw Agrippa as a helpful consultant because the king was &#8220;well acquainted with all the customs and controversies of the Jews&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-3.htm">Acts 26:3</a>). By laying out the case:<p>&#8226; Festus acknowledged gaps in his own understanding (<a href="/acts/25-19.htm">Acts 25:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Agrippa gained first-hand exposure to the gospel Paul preached (<a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s innocence under Roman law became increasingly evident (<a href="/acts/25-18.htm">Acts 25:18</a>; <a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>).<p><a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> reminds believers that earthly authorities are God&#8217;s servants; here, those very authorities are drawn into God&#8217;s redemptive narrative, hearing truth while attempting to weigh legalities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There Is a Certain Man Whom Felix Left in Prison</b><p>Festus introduces Paul almost casually&#8212;&#8220;a certain man&#8221;&#8212;yet heaven views this man as Christ&#8217;s chosen witness.

Extra days in Caesarea opened the door for Festus to seek Agrippa&#8217;s counsel, setting the stage for Paul&#8217;s powerful defense in <a href="/bsb/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>. What men labeled a routine legal review became a platform for the gospel to echo through palaces, fulfilling Christ&#8217;s promise that His witness would reach kings&#8212;and reminding believers that every delay, every audience, and every detail rests firmly in God&#8217;s providential care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king.</span>--The matter seems to have come in, as it were, in the course of conversation.
