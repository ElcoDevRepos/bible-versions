The men were sent by Cornelius, a Roman centurion, as part of a divine plan revealed through an angelic vision. This reflects the theme of divine guidance and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>from Caesarea</b><br>Caesarea was a significant Roman city and the administrative center of Judea.

The city's role in this narrative highlights the Gospel's reach into influential and diverse areas.<p><b>stopped at the house</b><br>The act of stopping at a house signifies hospitality and the importance of personal encounters in the spread of the Gospel. In the early church, homes were central to worship and fellowship, reflecting the intimate and communal nature of early Christian gatherings.<p><b>where I was staying</b><br>This phrase indicates Peter's temporary residence, suggesting the itinerant nature of apostolic ministry.

While Peter is still processing the rooftop vision (<a href="/acts/10-17.htm">Acts 10:17-19</a>), the Lord synchronizes events so that Cornelius&#8217;s messengers arrive at precisely the right moment. Scripture repeatedly showcases this sovereign choreography&#8212;think of the ram appearing &#8220;at the right time&#8221; for Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13-14</a>, or Philip meeting the Ethiopian eunuch &#8220;on the desert road&#8221; in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-29</a>. Such moments remind us nothing in God&#8217;s plan is accidental; He aligns circumstances to move His gospel forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three men</b><p>Luke notes &#8220;three men,&#8221; echoing the biblical principle of confirmed testimony: &#8220;Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>). Their number validates Cornelius&#8217;s request and underlines the seriousness of their mission. Peter can receive them with confidence, knowing God often employs multiple witnesses&#8212;consider Paul&#8217;s companions on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>) or the women at the empty tomb (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sent to me</b><p>These men are not self-appointed; they are &#8220;sent.&#8221; Cornelius dispatched them (<a href="/acts/10-8.htm">Acts 10:8</a>), yet ultimately the Sender is God. This reflects Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, I also send you&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>). Peter discerns that God&#8217;s commission can come through unexpected channels, even Gentiles. When the Spirit later says, &#8220;Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-20.htm">Acts 10:20</a>), He confirms that divine authority stands behind their arrival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Caesarea</b><p>Caesarea is a Roman port city, seat of Gentile governance in Judea (<a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; 23:23-24). Mentioning it signals a groundbreaking shift: the gospel is stepping beyond Jewish borders into the Gentile world. Earlier, Jesus had promised His witnesses would reach &#8220;the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Caesarea represents a gateway to that larger mission, foreshadowing Paul&#8217;s later voyages from the same harbor (<a href="/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stopped at the house</b><p>The men &#8220;stopped at the house.&#8221; God brings seekers right to Peter&#8217;s doorstep, paralleling how Jesus sent the seventy-two into homes prepared for them (<a href="/luke/10-5.htm">Luke 10:5-7</a>). Peter&#8217;s lodging with Simon the tanner (<a href="/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6</a>) already stretched Jewish comfort zones; now Gentiles knock at the door, pressing him further. The scene models hospitality and readiness: &#8220;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where I was staying</b><p>The phrase underscores God&#8217;s intimate oversight&#8212;even Peter&#8217;s temporary address is part of the divine plan. Paul later affirms that God &#8220;determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live&#8221; so people might seek Him (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>). By placing Peter in Joppa, near the sea and open to the nations, the Lord positions him for this pivotal encounter with Cornelius.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/11-11.htm">Acts 11:11</a> captures a hinge moment in redemptive history. God&#8217;s precise timing (&#8220;Just then&#8221;), validated witnesses (&#8220;three men&#8221;), divine commissioning (&#8220;sent to me&#8221;), cross-cultural reach (&#8220;from Caesarea&#8221;), doorstep opportunity (&#8220;stopped at the house&#8221;), and sovereign placement (&#8220;where I was staying&#8221;) all converge to propel the gospel into the Gentile world. The verse assures believers that the Lord orchestrates every detail to fulfill His Great Commission and invites us to trust His timing, welcome His messengers, and step through the doors He opens.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Forthwith</span> for <span class="accented">immediately</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">three men stood before the house in which we were</span> for <span class="accented">there were three men already come unto the house where I was</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">having been sent</span> for sent, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Just then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
