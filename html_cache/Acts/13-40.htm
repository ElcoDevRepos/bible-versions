In the context of <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, Paul is addressing the synagogue in Pisidian Antioch. The use of "watch out" indicates the seriousness of the message and the need for attentiveness. It echoes the biblical theme of being alert to spiritual truths and dangers, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to "keep watch."<p><b>that what was spoken by the prophets</b><br>Paul refers to the Old Testament prophets, whose messages were often warnings to the people of Israel about the consequences of disobedience and unbelief. This phrase underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, highlighting that the message of Jesus is a fulfillment of prophetic words. The prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, frequently warned of judgment for those who turned away from God.<p><b>does not happen to you:</b><br>This part of the verse is a direct appeal to the audience to heed the warning and avoid the fate that befell those who ignored the prophets. It implies a personal responsibility to respond to God's message. Historically, the Jewish people faced numerous consequences for not heeding prophetic warnings, such as the Babylonian exile. In the New Testament context, this serves as a caution against rejecting the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of prophetic revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is delivering a sermon in the synagogue in Pisidian Antioch, warning the listeners to heed the message of the prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>Paul's companion on the missionary journey, present during this sermon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pisidian_antioch.htm">Pisidian Antioch</a></b><br>A city in the region of Galatia where Paul and Barnabas are preaching to both Jews and God-fearing Gentiles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets whose warnings and prophecies Paul is urging the listeners to consider.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>The setting where Paul delivers his message, a place of Jewish worship and teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/heed_the_prophetic_warnings.htm">Heed the Prophetic Warnings</a></b><br>Just as Paul warned his listeners, we must pay attention to the warnings in Scripture and not dismiss them as irrelevant or unbelievable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognize_god's_work.htm">Recognize God's Work</a></b><br>Be vigilant in recognizing God's work in our lives and the world, even when it defies our expectations or understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoid_spiritual_complacency.htm">Avoid Spiritual Complacency</a></b><br>Spiritual complacency can lead to missing out on God's plans and purposes.
