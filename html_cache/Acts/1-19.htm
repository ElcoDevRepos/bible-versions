His demise and the circumstances surrounding it became widely known among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This reflects the close-knit nature of ancient communities where news spread rapidly. Jerusalem, being the center of Jewish religious life, was a place where significant events were quickly disseminated. The public nature of Judas's betrayal and its consequences would have been a topic of considerable discussion, especially among those who had witnessed the events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<p><b>so they called that field in their own language Akeldama</b><br>The field purchased with the money Judas received for betraying Jesus was called "Akeldama" in Aramaic, the common language spoken by the Jews in Jerusalem at the time. Aramaic was widely used in the region, and naming the field in this language indicates the local impact and recognition of the event. The name "Akeldama" itself carries significant meaning, as it directly relates to the circumstances of Judas's death and the blood money used to purchase the field.<p><b>that is, Field of Blood</b><br>The term "Field of Blood" has a dual significance. It refers both to the blood money paid to Judas for his betrayal and to the violent manner of his death. This name serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of Judas's actions and the fulfillment of prophecy. In <a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-10</a>, the purchase of the field is linked to the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which speaks of the thirty pieces of silver and the potter's field. The "Field of Blood" thus becomes a symbol of betrayal and the fulfillment of divine justice, highlighting the gravity of Judas's actions and the sovereignty of God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city for Jewish worship and the location where the early church began.
