This reflects his consistent strategy of engaging with Jews first in every city he visits (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>). His approach underscores the importance of dialogue and witness, even in adversity.

This hope encompasses the resurrection, a central theme in Paul's preaching (<a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>).

The "chain" symbolizes both his physical captivity and his unwavering commitment to the Gospel. This imagery resonates with <a href="/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>, where Paul describes himself as an "ambassador in chains."
