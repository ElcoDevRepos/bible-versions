The "it" refers to the burning bush, a miraculous phenomenon where the bush was on fire but not consumed. This sight was extraordinary and supernatural, capturing Moses' attention and evoking wonder. The burning bush is symbolic of God's presence, purity, and holiness, as fire often represents in Scripture (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). Moses' marveling indicates his recognition of the divine nature of the event, setting the stage for his calling as a prophet and leader of Israel. This moment is pivotal, marking the beginning of God's direct communication with Moses, who would become the deliverer of Israel.<p><b>As he approached to look more closely,</b><br>Moses' decision to approach the bush demonstrates his curiosity and willingness to engage with the divine. This act of drawing near is significant, as it reflects a desire to understand and experience God's presence more fully. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, approaching a divine manifestation was a bold move, indicating reverence and a readiness to receive a message or mission. This mirrors the call to believers to draw near to God, as seen in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, where approaching God is met with His nearness to us.<p><b>the voice of the Lord came to him:</b><br>The voice of the Lord signifies direct divine communication, a rare and profound experience in the biblical narrative. This encounter is a theophany, where God reveals Himself audibly to Moses. The voice of the Lord is authoritative and commanding, initiating Moses' role as a prophet. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God speaks directly to individuals, such as to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). The voice of the Lord here not only calls Moses but also establishes the covenant relationship between God and His chosen leader, foreshadowing the greater revelation of God through Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

The fire blazes, yet the bush is not consumed&#8212;something both natural and supernatural at once (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>- Genuine worship begins with wonder. Like the disciples who were &#8220;utterly astonished&#8221; when Jesus calmed the sea (<a href="/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51-52</a>), Moses&#8217; amazement sets the stage for obedience.<p>- Marveling guards us from treating holy things casually (<a href="/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8</a>). Moses&#8217; reverence here contrasts with Israel&#8217;s later grumbling at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As he approached to look more closely</b><p>- Moses turns aside; he draws nearer. Curiosity becomes pursuit (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly encourages drawing near to God: &#8220;Come near to God, and He will come near to you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>; also <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>- Yet there is tension: God is approachable, but He is also holy. Soon Moses will be told to remove his sandals (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>). This balance&#8212;invitation and reverence&#8212;runs throughout the Bible (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>).<p>- Our faith is not passive. Like Moses, we respond actively, moving toward the light we have received (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The voice of the Lord came to him</b><p>- The climax is not the visual sign but the spoken word. Sight led to hearing; marvel led to message. God communicates verbally, binding Himself to clear, understandable language (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6-10</a>).<p>- From Eden onward, the Lord has addressed humanity directly (<a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>). His voice creates (<a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>), calls (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>), and commissions (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>).<p>- For Moses, this voice launches a lifelong mission: deliver Israel, reveal God&#8217;s law, prefigure Christ as the ultimate Redeemer (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="/acts/7-37.htm">Acts 7:37</a>).<p>- Today, God still speaks through His written Word, which carries the same authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-31.htm">Acts 7:31</a> highlights a real moment in history when Moses encountered God in the burning bush. The sequence&#8212;seeing, marveling, approaching, hearing&#8212;models how the Lord captures a person&#8217;s attention, stirs holy awe, invites closer engagement, and then delivers a life-shaping word. For believers, the passage reassures us that God still reveals Himself, invites us near, and speaks with authority, calling us to reverent wonder and obedient mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">The voice of the Lord came unto him.</span>--The speech agrees with <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm" title="And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.">Exodus 3:4</a> in ascribing the voice to the Lord, the Eternal, while the visible manifestation was that of the angel of the Lord. It hardly belongs to the interpretation of the speech to discuss the relation between the two statements. Speaking generally, it may be said that all, or nearly all, theophanies, or divine manifestations, in the Old Testament addressed to the sense of sight resolve themselves into angelophanies, all manifestations addressed exclusively to the sense of hearing into revelations by the Son, as the LOGOS, or eternal WORD.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- And when for when</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">behold</span> for <span class="accented">behold it</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there came a voice of the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">the voice of the Lord came unto him</span>, A.V.
