The context is the oppression of the Israelites in Egypt, where they were subjected to harsh slavery. The man abusing his neighbor represents internal strife among the Israelites, highlighting the challenges Moses faced not only from external oppression but also from within his own people. This internal conflict is a recurring theme in the history of Israel, as seen in other instances such as the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16).<p><b>pushed Moses aside</b><br>Moses, though destined to be the deliverer of Israel, is initially rejected by his own people. This act of pushing Moses aside symbolizes the rejection of God's chosen leader, a theme that recurs throughout biblical history. It foreshadows the rejection of Jesus Christ by the Jewish leaders, as noted in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where it states, "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him." This rejection is a significant aspect of the narrative of salvation history.<p><b>and said, &#8216;Who made you ruler and judge over us?&#8217;</b><br>This question challenges Moses' authority and foreshadows the resistance he will face as a leader. It reflects a common human tendency to resist divinely appointed authority, as seen in the Israelites' later complaints against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-4</a>). The question also echoes the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is established by God. This phrase also typologically points to Christ, who was questioned and rejected by the religious leaders of His time, as seen in <a href="/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23</a>, where they question His authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
