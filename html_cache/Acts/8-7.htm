In the ancient world, loud cries or shrieks were often associated with demonic activity, as seen in other biblical accounts such as <a href="/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a> and <a href="/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33-35</a>. These shrieks could signify the resistance of the unclean spirits to being cast out, highlighting the spiritual battle taking place.<p><b>Unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed</b><br>"Unclean spirits" refers to demonic entities that were believed to inhabit and control individuals, causing physical and spiritual harm. The term "unclean" denotes their impurity and opposition to God's holiness. The casting out of these spirits by Philip demonstrates the power of the Holy Spirit working through him, fulfilling Jesus' promise in <a href="/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17</a> that believers would cast out demons in His name. This act also signifies the breaking of spiritual bondage and the advance of God's kingdom.<p><b>And many of the paralyzed and lame were healed</b><br>The healing of the paralyzed and lame is a testament to the miraculous power of God working through Philip. Physical healing in the New Testament often serves as a sign of the inbreaking of God's kingdom and the restoration that comes through Jesus Christ. This healing echoes the ministry of Jesus, who frequently healed the sick and disabled, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/15-30.htm">Matthew 15:30-31</a>. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the coming age of salvation when the lame will leap like a deer. The healing acts as a physical manifestation of spiritual renewal and the hope of complete restoration in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip is now in Samaria preaching the gospel and performing miracles, including exorcisms and healings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region with a complex history of tension between Jews and Samaritans.
