The context is Peter's miraculous escape from prison, which was unexpected even by those praying for his release. The phrase indicates a common human reaction to miraculous events, highlighting the tension between faith and doubt. In Jewish culture, the idea of someone being "out of their mind" could imply a lack of understanding or being overwhelmed by emotion. This skepticism is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's actions were initially met with disbelief, such as Sarah's laughter at the promise of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>).<p><b>But when she kept insisting it was so,</b><br>The persistence of the servant girl, Rhoda, is significant. Her insistence underscores the importance of testimony and witness in the early church. This mirrors the role of women as the first witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus, emphasizing that God often uses unexpected individuals to convey His truth. Rhoda's insistence also highlights the theme of perseverance in faith, a recurring motif in the New Testament, as seen in the parable of the persistent widow (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>).<p><b>they said, &#8220;It must be his angel.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a Jewish belief in guardian angels and the idea that an angel could appear in the likeness of a person. The concept of angels as messengers and protectors is well-documented in Scripture, with examples such as Daniel in the lions' den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>) and Peter's earlier release from prison by an angel (<a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>). The mention of "his angel" suggests a belief in personal angels assigned to individuals, a notion supported by passages like <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>, where Jesus speaks of angels who watch over children. This belief in angels underscores the spiritual worldview of the early Christians, who understood the reality of spiritual beings and their involvement in human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rhoda.htm">Rhoda</a></b><br>A servant girl who recognized Peter's voice at the gate and reported his presence to the others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who was miraculously freed from prison by an angel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believers.htm">The Believers</a></b><br>A group of early Christians gathered in prayer at Mary&#8217;s house, the mother of John Mark.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary's_house.htm">Mary&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where the believers were praying for Peter&#8217;s release.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel.htm">Angel</a></b><br>A spiritual being who facilitated Peter&#8217;s escape from prison, and whom the believers mistakenly thought was at the door.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_prayer.htm">Faith in Prayer</a></b><br>The believers were praying for Peter&#8217;s release, yet struggled to believe when their prayers were answered.

The church is under pressure, and hope feels fragile.<p>&#8226; Fear often produces harsh words (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38&#8211;40</a>).

But the expression is obscure, and we do not know exactly the nature of the belief on which it was grounded. They must have thought that perhaps Peter had been put to death in prison that very night, and that his angel, speaking with his voice, was sent to announce it to the Church. The narrative is a striking instance how "slow of heart to believe" are even the most devout. They were praying very earnestly for Peter's life; their prayer was granted; and yet the announcement of it only draws out the answer, "Thou art mad!" and then, as an alternative, the explanation, "It is his angel!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You are out of your mind,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(Main&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3105.htm">Strong's 3105: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be raving mad, speak as a madman.
