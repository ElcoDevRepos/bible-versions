In biblical times, the number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection, which may imply the completeness of the judgment that was about to occur. This period also allowed for the news of Ananias's death to spread among the believers, setting the stage for Sapphira's entrance.<p><b>his wife also came in</b><br>Sapphira's entrance into the scene is significant as it highlights the unity and shared responsibility between husband and wife in their actions. In the cultural context of the time, women were often seen as extensions of their husbands, yet the narrative here emphasizes individual accountability before God. This moment underscores the importance of personal integrity and the consequences of deceit within the early Christian community.<p><b>unaware of what had happened</b><br>Sapphira's ignorance of the events that had transpired with her husband suggests a lack of communication or perhaps a deliberate separation from the community's immediate response. This detail emphasizes the suddenness and severity of the judgment that fell upon Ananias, as well as the isolation that sin can create.

She was not coerced; she stepped into the same setting of truth where Peter had exposed her husband.<p>&#8226; The church gathering was a place of honesty (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>), so her entrance becomes a test of integrity, similar to Achan&#8217;s household sharing in guilt (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-26</a>) and to the warning of <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30-32</a> that sin in the assembly brings discipline.<p>&#8226; Her presence shows how sin often spreads through close relationships; the couple&#8217;s earlier agreement (<a href="/acts/5-2.htm">Acts 5:2</a>) illustrates <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>, &#8220;Can two walk together unless they are agreed?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unaware of what had happened</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Unaware&#8221; highlights how sin blinds (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).
