This prophecy is fulfilled in the New Testament through the passion of Jesus Christ, who endured physical and emotional suffering leading up to and during His crucifixion. The concept of a suffering Messiah was a stumbling block for many Jews of the time, who expected a triumphant political leader. However, the suffering was necessary for the atonement of sin, aligning with God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and as the first to rise from the dead</b><br>Jesus Christ's resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, signifying victory over sin and death. He is referred to as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating that His resurrection is the first of many to come. This event fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is a historical event witnessed by many, providing a foundation for the hope of eternal life for believers.<p><b>would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles.&#8221;</b><br>The proclamation of light refers to the revelation of truth and salvation through Jesus Christ. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus declares Himself as the "light of the world," bringing spiritual illumination and guidance. The phrase "our people" refers to the Jewish nation, highlighting that Jesus' ministry began with the Jews, fulfilling the promises made to the patriarchs. However, the inclusion of "the Gentiles" signifies the universal scope of the Gospel, breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord is made a light for the nations, extending salvation to the ends of the earth. The early church, as seen in Acts, embodies this mission, spreading the message of Christ to all peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is giving his defense before King Agrippa, explaining his mission and the message of the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus, the Messiah, who suffered, died, and rose again, fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_agrippa.htm">King Agrippa</a></b><br>The ruler before whom Paul is making his defense, a significant figure in the Herodian dynasty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people to whom the message of salvation through Christ is also proclaimed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, which is central to Christian faith and the message Paul is sharing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_messiah.htm">The Suffering Messiah</a></b><br>Understand that the suffering of Christ was prophesied and necessary for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>Reflect on the significance of Christ's suffering in your personal salvation and how it calls you to a life of gratitude and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection_as_the_cornerstone.htm">The Resurrection as the Cornerstone</a></b><br>Recognize the resurrection of Jesus as the cornerstone of Christian faith, providing hope and assurance of eternal life.<br><br>Consider how the resurrection empowers you to live a life of victory over sin and death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_light_to_all.htm">Proclaiming Light to All</a></b><br>Embrace the call to share the Gospel with both Jews and Gentiles, recognizing that the message of Christ is for all people.<br><br>Evaluate how you can be a light in your community, sharing the hope and truth of the Gospel in your daily interactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Study the Old Testament prophecies to see how they point to Jesus, strengthening your faith in the reliability of Scripture.<br><br>Use the fulfillment of prophecy as a tool for evangelism, showing others the divine nature of the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_26_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 26:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_26_23_Jesus_as_Messiah_Savior.htm">How does Acts 26:23 affirm Jesus as the prophesied Messiah and Savior?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Jesus_resurrection.htm">What does "first to rise from the dead" signify about Jesus' resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_26_23_Inspire_Gospel_sharing.htm">How can Acts 26:23 inspire us to share the Gospel with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_26_23_OT_Messiah_prophecies_link.htm">How does Acts 26:23 connect with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Acts_26_23_inspire_witnessing.htm">In what ways does Acts 26:23 encourage us to witness to "our people"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_26_23_Christ_s_prophecy_proof.htm">How does Acts 26:23 affirm the prophecy of Christ's suffering and resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Christ_s_resurrection.htm">Why is the resurrection of Christ significant in Acts 26:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_26_23_Proof_of_Jesus_as_Messiah.htm">How does Acts 26:23 support the claim of Jesus as the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_all_our_sins_forgiven_across_time.htm">What is Antioch's biblical significance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_festus_dismissing_paul's_claims.htm">Does Festus&#8217;s accusation in Acts 26:24 suggest that Paul&#8217;s claims are too extraordinary to be taken seriously?

The great body of the Jews had fixed their thoughts only on the prophetic visions of the glories of the Messiah's kingdom. Even the disciples of Jesus were slow to receive any other thought than that of conquest and triumph. Peter's "Be it far from thee, Lord" (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>) expressed the horror with which the thought of a suffering Christ at first struck him. It was not till they were led, after the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, into our Lord's own school of prophetic interpretation (<a href="/context/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25-26</a>; <a href="/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and taught to recognise the under-current of types and prophecies that pointed to a righteous Sufferer, as well as to a righteous King, that they were able to receive the truth. So it was that a "Christ crucified" was still "to the Jews a stumbling-block" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>). The speech at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="/context/acts/13-27.htm" title="For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.">Acts 13:27-35</a>) may be noted as showing the stress which St. Paul laid on this point.

The Vulgate renders it by <span class="accented">passibilis.</span> The Fathers (Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr) contrast the state of Christ in glory with his state in the flesh by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "impassible" and "passible." <span class="cmt_word">That he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim</span>, etc. Most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards, connect the first with the resurrection. "First from the resurrection," equal to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>). As Meyer truly says, "The chief stress of this sentence lies on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>." The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. <a href="/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.) Note on the whole the enormous stress laid by St. Paul on the fulfillment of prophecy as a proof of the truth of the gospel, following therein our Lord himself (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 27, 44, 45</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/26-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
