The testimony of God's goodness is seen in His provision and care for humanity, even when they are unaware of His presence. This aligns with the idea of common grace, where God extends His goodness to all people, regardless of their faith. Historically, this was a radical message in a polytheistic society, where gods were often seen as capricious and distant.<p><b>He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons,</b><br>Rain and fruitful seasons are tangible expressions of God's providence. In the ancient Near East, agriculture was central to life, and rain was crucial for survival. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a> highlight rain as a blessing from God. The phrase underscores God's sovereignty over nature, contrasting with pagan beliefs that attributed such phenomena to various deities. This also reflects the covenantal promises in the Old Testament, where obedience to God resulted in agricultural blessings (<a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>).<p><b>filling your hearts with food and gladness.</b><br>Food and gladness are direct results of God's provision, pointing to His desire for human flourishing. <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a> speaks of God providing food and wine to gladden the heart. This phrase suggests that physical sustenance and joy are interconnected, both gifts from God. In a cultural context, feasting and celebration were integral to community life, often associated with religious festivals. This reflects the biblical theme of joy as a response to God's goodness, seen in <a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>, where the joy of the Lord is described as strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>The apostles who are speaking to the people in Lystra, a city in the region of Lycaonia, during their first missionary journey.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lystra.htm">Lystra</a></b><br>A city in the Roman province of Galatia where Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel and performed miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>The primary audience in Lystra, who were largely unfamiliar with the Jewish Scriptures and needed to understand God's revelation through nature and providence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_general_revelation.htm">God's General Revelation</a></b><br>God reveals Himself not only through Scripture but also through His creation.

In speaking to peasants like those at Lystra, St. Paul naturally dwells most on the witness given through the divine goodness as manifested in nature. In addressing philosophers at Athens and at Rome, he points to the yet fuller witness of consciousness and conscience (<a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>; <a href="/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In that he did good.</span>--Better, as expressing the continuous manifestation of the divine will, "<span class= "ital">working</span> good, <span class= "ital">giving</span> rain, <span class= "ital">filling</span> our hearts." The MSS. vary, some giving "us" and "our," and some "you" and "your." The former is more characteristic of the sympathy which led St. Paul to identify himself with Gentile as well as Jew. The "joy of harvest" (<a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm" title="You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.">Isaiah 9:3</a>) was the common inheritance of each. The latter words in the Greek, from "giving us rain from heaven," are so distinctly rhythmical that they suggest the thought that St. Paul quotes from some hymn of praise which he had heard in a harvest or vintage festival, and which, as with the altar to the Unknown God at Athens, he claims as due to Him whom men ignorantly worshipped. (See Note on <a href="/acts/17-23.htm" title="For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.">Acts 17:23</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- And yet</span> for nevertheless, A.V.; <span class="accented">you from heaven rains</span> for us <span class="accented">rain from</span> hearer, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">your</span> for our, A.V. and T.R.
