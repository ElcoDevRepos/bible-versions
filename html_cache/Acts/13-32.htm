The "good news" refers to the Gospel, the central message of Christianity that Jesus Christ died for sins, was buried, and rose again. This proclamation is a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and reflects the early church's mission to spread the Gospel beyond Jewish communities to Gentiles, as seen in Paul's missionary journeys.<p><b>What God promised our fathers:</b><br>This phrase connects the Gospel message to the promises made by God to the patriarchs of Israel, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These promises include the covenantal blessings and the coming of a Messiah, as foretold in the Hebrew Scriptures (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3, 22</a>:18). The fulfillment of these promises is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasizing continuity between the Old and New Covenants. The reference to "our fathers" highlights the Jewish heritage of the early Christian message and underscores the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises, as seen in the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, they were on a missionary journey spreading the gospel.
