The "further threats" indicate the council's attempt to intimidate them into silence. This reflects the early church's persecution and the tension between the Jewish authorities and the new Christian movement. The decision to release them shows the council's inability to find a legal basis for punishment, highlighting the apostles' innocence and the divine protection over their mission.<p><b>They could not find a way to punish them,</b><br>The Sanhedrin was limited by the lack of evidence against Peter and John. This phrase underscores the legal and moral dilemma faced by the Jewish leaders, who were unable to deny the miracle performed. It also illustrates the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that His followers would face opposition but would be given wisdom to confound their accusers (<a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>).<p><b>because all the people were glorifying God for what had happened.</b><br>The miracle of healing the lame man at the temple gate (<a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1-10</a>) was undeniable and had led to widespread praise of God among the people. This public reaction made it politically risky for the Sanhedrin to punish the apostles, as it could incite unrest. The people's response reflects the power of God working through the apostles and serves as a testament to the truth of their message. This event parallels other instances in the Gospels where Jesus' miracles led to glorification of God, reinforcing the continuity of His work through the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons /
