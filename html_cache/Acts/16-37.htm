Here, he speaks directly to the officers, indicating his willingness to confront injustice. This reflects his boldness and commitment to truth, as seen throughout his missionary journeys.<p><b>They beat us publicly without a trial</b><br>In Roman law, citizens were entitled to a fair trial. The public beating of Paul and Silas violated this right, highlighting the miscarriage of justice.

This reflects a demand for accountability and justice, aligning with biblical principles of truth and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>.<p><b>Absolutely not!</b><br>Paul's emphatic refusal highlights his insistence on public acknowledgment of the wrongdoing. This mirrors the biblical call to stand firm in faith and truth, as encouraged in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>.<p><b>Let them come themselves and escort us out!</b><br>By demanding a public escort, Paul seeks to vindicate the Gospel and the integrity of its messengers.

It was the heaviest of all the charges brought by Cicero against Verres, the Governor of Sicily, that he had broken this law: "<span class= "ital">Facinus est vinciri civem Romanum, scelus verberari"</span> (Cic. <span class= "ital">in Verr.</span> v. 57). The words <span class= "ital">civis Romanus sum</span> acted almost like a charm in stopping the violence of provincial magistrates. St. Paul was a citizen by birth (see Note on <a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>), his father having probably been wealthy enough to buy the <span class= "ital">jus civitatis, </span>which brought with it commercial as well as personal privileges. It did not necessarily involve residence at Rome, but makes it probable that there were some points of contact with the imperial city.<p>There is something like a tone of irony in the "being Romans," echoing, as it did, the very words of his accusers (<a href="/acts/16-21.htm" title="And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.">Acts 16:21</a>). He, too, could stand on his rights as a citizen. The judges had not called on the prisoners for their defence, had not even questioned them. Even if they had not been citizens the trial was a flagrant breach of justice, and St. Paul wished to make the <span class= "ital">strategi</span> feel that it was so. Here we note that he seems to couple Silas with himself. It is possible, as the Latin form of his name, Silvanus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>) suggests, that he also was a citizen of Rome, but St. Paul's mode of speech was natural enough, even on the assumption that he only could claim the privilege. We could hardly expect him to say with minute accuracy: "They have beaten <span class= "ital">us</span> uncondemned, and I, for my part, am a Roman citizen."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> <span class="accented">- Publicly</span> for <span class="accented">openly</span> A.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>); <span class="accented">men that are</span> for <span class="accented">being</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">do they now cast</span> for <span class="accented">now do they thrust</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bring for fetch</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Men that are Romans</span>. We have exactly the same phrase in <a href="/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25</a>, on a similar occasion, where also is the only other example of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, uncondemned. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with a like meaning ("untried," "without trial"), is common in classical Greek. The Latin phrase is <span class="accented">indicta causa.</span> By the Lex Valeria (A.U.C. 254), "No quis magistratus civem Romanum adversus provocationem necaret neve verberaret," every Roman citizen had a right to appeal (<span class="accented">provocare</span>) to the populace against any sentence of death or stripes pronounced by the consuls or any other magistrate; and by the Lex Porcia (A.U.C. 506), no Roman citizen could be scourged. Silas, it appears from the phrase, "us... men that are Romans," was also a <span class="accented">civis Romanus.</span> But nothing more is known about it. It does not appear why their exemption as Roman citizens was not made good before; but probably the magistrates refused to listen to any plea in their haste and violence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/16-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Paul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
