This phrase indicates the divine inspiration given to David, allowing him to speak of future events. In the context of biblical prophecy, foreseeing often involves a revelation from God, which is consistent with the role of prophets in the Old Testament.<p><b>David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ</b><br>David's writings, particularly in the Psalms, are seen as prophetic, pointing to the Messiah. <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> is often cited as a prophecy of Christ's resurrection. The connection between David and Jesus is significant, as Jesus is often referred to as the Son of David, fulfilling the Davidic covenant that promised a ruler from David's line.<p><b>that He was not abandoned to Hades</b><br>Hades, in Jewish thought, is the realm of the dead. The prophecy indicates that the Messiah would not be left in the state of death. This aligns with the New Testament teaching of Jesus' victory over death and His resurrection, which is central to Christian faith.<p><b>nor did His body see decay</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical resurrection of Jesus. Unlike others who die and experience bodily decay, Jesus' resurrection was unique in that His body did not undergo corruption.
