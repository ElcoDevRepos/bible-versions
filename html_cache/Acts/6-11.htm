The term "prompted" suggests that these men were incited or bribed to bear false witness, a violation of the Ninth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). This reflects the corrupt practices of some religious leaders who were threatened by the early Christian movement. The act of prompting false witnesses is reminiscent of the trial of Jesus, where false testimony was also used (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy</b><br>Blasphemy, in Jewish law, was a serious accusation, often punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The charge of blasphemy against Stephen is significant as it mirrors the accusations made against Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-64.htm">Mark 14:64</a>). This reflects the tension between the early Christians and the Jewish authorities, who saw the new teachings as a threat to their traditional beliefs and power structures.<p><b>against Moses</b><br>Moses is a central figure in Judaism, representing the Law and the covenant between God and Israel. Accusing Stephen of blasphemy against Moses suggests that he was perceived as challenging the Mosaic Law or its interpretation. This accusation highlights the early Christian message that Jesus fulfilled the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and the shift from the old covenant to the new covenant in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>).<p><b>and against God.&#8221;</b><br>Blasphemy against God is the ultimate religious offense, indicating that Stephen's teachings were seen as undermining the very foundation of Jewish faith. This accusation underscores the radical nature of the Christian message, which proclaimed Jesus as the Son of God and the fulfillment of God's promises. The charge reflects the misunderstanding and fear of the religious leaders, who saw the new faith as a direct challenge to their authority and the established religious order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, chosen as one of the seven deacons to serve the early church.

The verse warns believers to expect opposition when standing firmly on God&#8217;s Word and highlights God&#8217;s justice against deceitful schemes, reassuring us that, like Stephen, we can remain steadfast, knowing the Lord vindicates His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</span>--The words indicate with sufficient clearness the nature of Stephen's teaching. The charge was a false one, but its falsehood was a distortion of the truth, as that against our Lord had been. He was accused of blasphemy in calling Himself the Son of God; making Himself equal with God (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>); threatening to destroy the Temple (<a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>)--each of the counts in the indictment resting on words that He had actually spoken. And Stephen, in like manner, was charged with offences for which there must have seemed colourable ground. He had taught, we must believe, that the days of the Temple were numbered; that with its fall the form of worship of which it was the representative would pass away, that the Law given by Moses was to make way for the higher revelation in Christ, and the privileges of the elect nation to be merged in the blessings of the universal Church. In this case, accordingly, the antagonism comes, not only or chiefly, as in the previous chapters, from the Sadducean high priests and their followers, but from the whole body of scribes and people. Pharisees and Sadducees, Hebrews and Hellenistae, are once more brought into coalition against the new truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they suborned</span>, etc. The resource of those who are worsted in argument is violence or treachery. <span class="cmt_word">Blasphemous words against Moses</span>. It must be remembered that at this time the whole Jewish people were in a state of ill-suppressed frenzy and most sensitive jealousy for the honor of the Mosaic institutions - feelings which broke out in constant revolts against the Roman power. The accusation against the apostles of speaking blasphemies against Moses was therefore the most likely one they could have pitched upon to stir up ill will against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
