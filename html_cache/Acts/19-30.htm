This assembly was likely a gathering of the Ephesians stirred up by Demetrius, a silversmith who opposed Paul's teachings because they threatened the local idol-making industry. Paul's willingness to confront the crowd demonstrates his courage and echoes his previous actions in places like Lystra and Philippi, where he faced persecution (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>, <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-24</a>). The assembly in Ephesus was a tumultuous gathering, and Paul's intent to speak shows his dedication to clarifying the truth of the Gospel, even in hostile environments. This mirrors Christ's own willingness to face opposition for the sake of truth (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>).<p><b>but the disciples would not allow him</b><br>The disciples' intervention highlights their concern for Paul's safety.

The disciples' decision also underscores the importance of wisdom and discernment in ministry, balancing boldness with prudence. This protective stance can be seen as a fulfillment of the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, where the prudent see danger and take refuge.
