This moment marks the beginning of the apostles' public ministry after the ascension of Jesus. The "Eleven" refers to the remaining apostles after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and death, highlighting the unity and authority of the apostolic group. This setting is significant as it occurs during Pentecost, a Jewish feast, when Jerusalem was filled with pilgrims from various regions.<p><b>lifted up his voice</b><br>Peter's action of raising his voice signifies the importance and urgency of his message. In the cultural context, public speaking was a common method for addressing large crowds, and Peter's boldness contrasts with his previous denials of Jesus. This transformation is attributed to the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, which had just been poured out on the apostles.<p><b>and addressed the crowd</b><br>The crowd consisted of devout Jews from every nation under heaven, gathered in Jerusalem for the feast. This diverse audience underscores the universal nature of the gospel message. Peter's address is a fulfillment of Jesus' command to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and beyond, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p><b>Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem</b><br>Peter specifically addresses the local inhabitants and those visiting Jerusalem, acknowledging their shared Jewish heritage. This greeting establishes common ground and respect, essential for effective communication. The mention of "Judea" and "Jerusalem" connects the message to the heart of Jewish religious life and prophecy.<p><b>let this be known to you</b><br>Peter's declaration emphasizes the importance and truth of the message he is about to deliver. This phrase serves as a call to attention, urging the audience to recognize the significance of the events they are witnessing, which are the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<p><b>and listen carefully to my words</b><br>Peter's exhortation to listen carefully indicates the gravity of his message. In the biblical context, listening implies not just hearing but understanding and responding. This call to attentiveness is crucial as Peter is about to explain the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and its implications for salvation history, connecting it to the prophecy of Joel and the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership among the disciples and his boldness in proclaiming the gospel.

Timidity has become boldness; for the few hasty words recorded in the Gospels we have elaborate discourses. There is a method and insight in the way he deals with the prophecies of the Christ altogether unlike anything that we have seen in him before. If we were reading a fictitious history, we should rightly criticise the author for the want of consistency in his portraiture of the same character in the first and second volumes of his work. As it is, the inconsistency becomes almost an evidence of the truth of the narratives that contain it. The writer of a made-up-history, bent only upon reconciling the followers of Peter and of Paul, would have made the former more prominent in the Gospels or less prominent in the Acts. And the facts which St. Luke narrates are an adequate explanation of the phenomena. In the interval that had passed, Peter's mind had been opened by his Lord's teaching to understand the Scriptures (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm" title="Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,">Luke 24:45</a>), and then he had been endued, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, with power from on high. That which he now speaks is the first utterance of the new gift of prophecy, and followed rightly on I the portent of the "tongues" to bring about the work of conversion which they had no power to accomplish. The speech which follows was spoken either in the Aramaic of Palestine, or, more probably, in the Greek, which was common in Galilee, and which would be intelligible to all, or nearly all, of the pilgrims from distant countries.<p><span class= "bld">And said unto them.</span>--The verb is not the word commonly so rendered, but that which is translated "utterance," or "to utter," in <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>. The unusual word was probably repeated here to indicate that what follows was just as much an "utterance" of the Holy Spirit, working on and through the spiritual powers of man, as <span class= "ital">the</span> marvel of the "tongues" had been.<p><span class= "bld">Hearken to my words.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">give ear to.</span> The verb is an unusual one, and is found here only in the New Testament. It is used not unfrequently in the LXX., as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>; Job 23:18.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> <span class="accented">- Spake forth</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">give ear unto</span> for <span class="accented">hearken to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hath been spoken</span> for <span class="accented">was spoken</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But Peter</span>, etc. Peter stands up before the eleven as their primate, foremost in the authority of action as in precedence of place; and the apostles stand up before the multitude of believers, as those to whom Christ committed the government of his Church (see <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). Spake forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, the same word as in ver. 4, "utterance "); implying the utterance of a loud and grave oration. In <a href="/1_chronicles/26.htm">1 Chronicles 26</a>. it is the phrase of the LXX. for those who <span class="accented">prophesied</span> with harps. From it is derived the word <span class="accented">apophthegm</span>, "a remarkable saying" (Johnson's Dictionary). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that dwell at Jerusalem</span>; the same as those described in ver. 5. They were foreign Jews who, either for the feast or for other causes, had taken up their abode at Jerusalem, and are distinguished from the men <span class="accented">of Judea</span>, the Jews who were natives of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Give ear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); found only here in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX. as the rendering of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>; <a href="/job/33-1.htm">Job 33:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). It is not classical Greek, and seems to have been coined by the LXX., as the equivalent of the above-named Hebrew word. It seems to be a rhetorical phrase. The thing to <span class="accented">be known</span> unto them was that they saw the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy in what had happened; for it was quite a mistake to attribute it to drunkenness. <span class="cmt_word">By the</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>); spoken by God through the prophet. The full phrase occurs in <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5, 15</a>.
