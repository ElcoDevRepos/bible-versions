This term was used by early Christians to describe their faith, emphasizing Jesus as the path to salvation (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Felix's familiarity with the Way suggests that Christianity had made significant inroads into Roman society, even among its leaders. Historically, Felix was known for his harsh rule and corruption, which is documented by the historian Tacitus. His awareness of the Way indicates that the movement was gaining attention and possibly causing unrest, which Roman authorities would have been keen to monitor.<p><b>adjourned the hearing and said</b><br>Felix's decision to adjourn the hearing reflects a common Roman legal practice of delaying judgment, often to gather more information or to avoid making a politically risky decision. This delay tactic could also be seen as a way to placate both the Jewish leaders, who were accusing Paul, and the Roman authorities, who were interested in maintaining peace. The adjournment shows Felix's political maneuvering, as he sought to balance the interests of different groups under his governance.<p><b>&#8220;When Lysias the commander comes, I will decide your case.&#8221;</b><br>Lysias, the Roman commander in Jerusalem, had previously rescued Paul from a Jewish mob (<a href="/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31-32</a>) and sent him to Felix with a letter explaining the situation (<a href="/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26-30</a>). By waiting for Lysias, Felix was likely seeking further clarification on the events that led to Paul's arrest. This reflects the Roman legal system's reliance on eyewitness accounts and official reports. The mention of Lysias underscores the importance of Roman military authority in maintaining order in Judea. Felix's statement also highlights the tension between Roman law and Jewish religious concerns, as Paul was being accused of violating Jewish law, yet was a Roman citizen entitled to a fair trial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/felix.htm">Felix</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, known for his knowledge of "the Way," which refers to early Christianity.

He had already received a detailed letter from Claudius Lysias explaining why Paul was sent to him (<a href="/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26&#8211;30</a>). Luke writes, &#8220;Then Felix&#8221; to show a clear historical sequence, rooting this scene in real time and space&#8212;just as he did in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>. Key background facts:<p>&#8226; Felix held the title procurator from AD 52&#8211;59, sharing power with his Jewish wife Drusilla (<a href="/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; His court in Caesarea had jurisdiction over matters that threatened Roman order (compare <a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier hearings, such as the one before Gallio in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12&#8211;16</a>), establish a pattern of Roman officials having to weigh Jewish accusations against believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was well informed about the Way</b><p>Luke notes that Felix had accurate knowledge of &#8220;the Way,&#8221; an early name for the Christian faith (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; 19:9). This phrase tells us:<p>&#8226; The gospel had already reached the highest levels of Roman administration (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Felix&#8217;s familiarity removed any excuse of ignorance; he was accountable for what he knew, echoing Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>.<p>&#8226; The Way&#8217;s reputation for righteous living and peaceful assembly was widely recognized (<a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>adjourned the hearing</b><p>Felix paused proceedings instead of rendering an immediate verdict. This reflects several realities:<p>&#8226; Roman law allowed a governor to suspend a case to secure additional witnesses (<a href="/acts/25-16.htm">Acts 25:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Postponement bought time for political calculation; Felix wanted to avoid alienating either the Jewish leadership or Rome, much like Pontius Pilate&#8217;s wavering in <a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>.<p>&#8226; For Paul, delay meant continued incarceration but also divine protection from assassination plots (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12&#8211;14, 24</a>:27).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said, &#8220;When Lysias the commander comes&#8221;</b><p>Felix anchored his postponement to the arrival of Claudius Lysias, the military tribune who first rescued Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31&#8211;32</a>). By invoking Lysias:<p>&#8226; He sought corroboration of events reported in the tribune&#8217;s letter (<a href="/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; He shifted responsibility, a tactic echoed later when Festus would appeal to Agrippa (<a href="/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention shows Luke&#8217;s careful, factual reporting, matching earlier correspondence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will decide your case</b><p>Felix promised a future judgment, yet two outcomes emerged:<p>&#8226; He delayed for two years, hoping for a bribe and political advantage (<a href="/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, he left Paul imprisoned to please the Jews, demonstrating that neutrality toward the gospel is itself a decision (<a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>; <a href="/acts/18-17.htm">Acts 18:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/24-22.htm">Acts 24:22</a> portrays a well-informed governor using legal postponement to navigate political pressures, while God sovereignly keeps Paul safe and the gospel moving forward. Felix knew the truth about the Way, deferred judgment under the guise of procedural thoroughness, and showed that procrastination before divine revelation is still a refusal to act. The verse challenges every reader to move beyond delay and align decisively with the truth they have been given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Having more perfect knowledge of that way . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">of the way.</span> (See Note on <a href="/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>.) The comparative implies a reference to an average standard. Felix was too well-informed to yield any answer to the declamatory statements of Tertullus. He saw that the prisoner was no common <span class= "ital">Sicarius, </span>or leader of sedition. He knew something as to the life of the sect of Nazarenes. That knowledge may well have been acquired either at Jerusalem, which the procurator would naturally visit at the great festivals and other occasions, or at Caesarea, where, as we know, Philip the Evangelist had, some twenty-five years before, founded a Christian community, which included among its members Cornelius and other Roman soldiers, or even, we may add, in the imperial capital itself. His wife Drusilla, also, the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., may have contributed something to his knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span>--Leaving the general attack on the "way" of the Nazarenes, or Christians, Felix proposes to inquire into the actual circumstances of the case brought before him. It is remarkable that this adjournment leads to an indefinite postponement. Possibly the accusers felt that they had fired their last shot in the speech of Tertullus, and, seeing that that had failed, thought that the judge had made up his mind against them, and withdrew from the prosecution. The detention of the prisoner under such circumstances was only too common an incident in the provincial administration of justice in the Roman empire, as it has since been in other corrupt or ill-governed states.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying</span> for <span class="accented">and whoa Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">determine</span> for <span class="accented">know the uttermost of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Having more exact knowledge</span>, etc. At Caesarea, Felix must have seen and heard something of Christianity. The conversion of Cornelius with his household and friends, men belonging to the dominant Roman power; the work of Philip the evangelist, residing probably for some years at Caesarea, and working among Romans as well as Jews, must have given Felix some knowledge of "the Way." He would learn something, too, both of Judaism and Christianity from Drusilla, his wife (ver. 24, note). <span class="cmt_word">When Lysias... shall come</span> (see vers. 7, 8, and note). <span class="cmt_word">I will determine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see above, <a href="/acts/23-15.htm">Acts 23:15</a>, where the verb is in the active voice, and is rendered in the R.V.
