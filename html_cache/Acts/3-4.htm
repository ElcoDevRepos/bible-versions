In the cultural context of the time, beggars were often ignored or looked down upon. Peter's direct gaze signifies acknowledgment and respect, reflecting the Christian teaching of seeing the inherent value in every individual. This act of looking directly can be seen as a reflection of Jesus' own ministry, where He often engaged personally with those marginalized by society (e.g., the woman at the well in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>).<p><b>as did John</b><br>John's participation underscores the unity and partnership in the early church's mission. The apostles often worked in pairs, as seen in Jesus sending out the seventy-two in <a href="/luke/10.htm">Luke 10:1</a>. This joint action also emphasizes the communal aspect of the early Christian movement, where believers supported and reinforced each other's ministry efforts. It reflects the biblical principle of two or more witnesses establishing a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Look at us!&#8221; said Peter.</b><br>Peter's command for the man to look at them is significant. In the cultural context, eye contact was a means of establishing a personal connection and conveying sincerity. This directive can be seen as a precursor to the miraculous healing that follows, indicating that something significant is about to occur. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual awakening, where one must shift focus from earthly concerns to divine possibilities. This mirrors Jesus' call for people to "look" to Him for salvation and healing, as seen in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>, where looking to the Son of Man brings eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his boldness and leadership in the early church.
