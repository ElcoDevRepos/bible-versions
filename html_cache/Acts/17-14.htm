This action of sending Paul away was likely due to the threat posed by hostile Jews from Thessalonica who had come to Berea to stir up trouble (<a href="/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>). The urgency implied by "immediately" suggests the seriousness of the threat. The "coast" likely refers to the Aegean Sea, indicating a strategic move to ensure Paul's safety and facilitate his continued missionary work. This reflects the early church's commitment to protecting its leaders and spreading the Gospel.<p><b>but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea</b><br>Silas and Timothy staying behind indicates their role in strengthening and encouraging the new believers in Berea.

Many of the better MSS., however, give "as far as the sea," and this is probably the meaning even of the reading followed by the Authorised version. The absence of any mention of places between Ber?a and Athens, (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Amphipolis and Apollonia are mentioned in <a href="/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1</a>), is presumptive evidence that St. Paul actually travelled by sea, and rounding the promontory of Sunium, entered Athens by the Piraeus. He had been accompanied so far by some of those who had escorted him from Beraea, but when they too went back, he was, we must remember, for the first time since the commencement of his missionary labours, absolutely alone. His yearning for companionship and counsel is shown in the urgent message sent to Silas and Timotheus to come "with all speed" (literally, <span class= "ital">as quickly as possible</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> As far as we can gather from <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1Thessalonians 3:1-3</a>, Timotheus came by himself to Athens, probably after the scene at the Areopagus, and was sent back at once with words of counsel and comfort to those whom he reported as suffering much tribulation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Forth</span> for <span class="accented">away</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as far as</span> for <span class="accented">as it were</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>), A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">As far as to the sea</span>.

Whether Timothy left Philippi with St. Paul, or whether, as is not improbable, he joined him at Thessalonica, cannot be decided.
