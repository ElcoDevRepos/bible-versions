This reflects the close bond and deep affection between Paul and the believers in Ephesus. Paul had spent about three years in Ephesus, teaching and building the church (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-10</a>). His statement likely reminded them of the sacrifices and challenges they had faced together. The grief also underscores the emotional and spiritual connection that leaders and congregations can develop.<p><b>that they would never see his face again.</b><br>Paul's declaration that they would not see him again was a poignant moment. It highlights the reality of his impending journey to Jerusalem, where he anticipated facing persecution (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-23</a>). This statement also reflects the transient nature of missionary work and the sacrifices involved. It echoes Jesus' own words to His disciples about His departure (<a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a>), drawing a parallel between Paul's mission and Christ's. The finality of the statement emphasizes the seriousness of Paul's mission and the potential dangers he faced.<p><b>Then they accompanied him to the ship.</b><br>The act of accompanying Paul to the ship signifies the deep respect and love the Ephesian elders had for him. It was customary in ancient times to escort a departing guest as a sign of honor and affection. This gesture also reflects the communal nature of the early church, where believers supported one another in practical ways. The journey to the ship symbolizes the transition from one phase of ministry to another, as Paul continued his mission to spread the Gospel. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical farewells, such as Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2:1-12</a>), where a mentor and mentee part ways, marking the continuation of God's work through different individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is saying farewell to the Ephesian elders.

The Ephesian elders loved him as a father in the faith; their sorrow mirrors the disciples&#8217; heaviness when Jesus spoke of His own departure (<a href="/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>). Scripture never rebukes such grief&#8212;&#8220;I wrote to you out of great anguish of heart and with many tears&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>). Healthy Christian fellowship runs deep:<p>&#8226;It is rooted in shared labor for the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226;It is strengthened by prayer and mutual encouragement (<a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36</a>).<p>&#8226;It feels loss keenly because the bond is real, not superficial (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by his statement that they would never see his face again</b><p>Earlier Paul had told them, &#8220;I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>). The finality of those words cut deeply. Yet they also had a forward look:<p>&#8226;Paul expected hardship and likely martyrdom (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226;The elders trusted God&#8217;s sovereignty even when outcomes hurt (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p>&#8226;Their grief was tempered by hope&#8212;one day they would meet again around Christ&#8217;s throne (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<p>True faith does not deny pain; it anchors it to the certainty of resurrection joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they accompanied him to the ship</b><p>Love moved them from emotion to action.

Such gestures:<p>&#8226;Express solidarity&#8212;going &#8220;the extra mile&#8221; for one another (<a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>).<p>&#8226;Model generous hospitality and support for those sent out (3 <a href="/bsb/john/6.htm">John 6-8</a>).<p>&#8226;Seal farewells with visible acts of blessing (<a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>).<p>The scene urges today&#8217;s church to match affectionate words with tangible care for servants of the gospel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-38.htm">Acts 20:38</a> captures a moment of heartfelt sorrow, sober realism, and steadfast love. The elders&#8217; grief shows the depth of Christian relationships; Paul&#8217;s prediction underscores the cost of obedient discipleship; their escort to the ship turns affection into action. Together these elements remind believers to value fellowship, face life&#8217;s partings with gospel hope, and serve one another in practical ways until the promised reunion in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - The <span class="accented">word which he had spoken</span> for <span class="accented">the words which he spake</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">behold</span> for <span class="accented">see</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brought him on his way</span> for <span class="accented">accompanied him</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Brought him on his way</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as <a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>.
