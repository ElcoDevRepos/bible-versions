The resurrection is a pivotal event in Christian theology, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God's Holy One not seeing decay. The resurrection is also a cornerstone for the apostolic preaching in the Book of Acts, as seen in Peter's sermon in <a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24-32</a>. Historically, the resurrection is attested by multiple witnesses and is foundational for the early church's growth and the spread of Christianity.<p><b>never to see decay</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief that Jesus' resurrection was not temporary but eternal. Unlike others who were raised from the dead in the Bible, such as Lazarus, Jesus' resurrection was unique because He would never die again. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and distinguishes Jesus as the eternal Son of God. The concept of not seeing decay also connects to the idea of Jesus as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating that believers will also share in this resurrection life.<p><b>As He has said: &#8216;I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase refers to the Davidic Covenant, which promised an everlasting kingdom through David's lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The "holy and sure blessings" are understood as the fulfillment of God's promises to David, which are ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, the Messiah. <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a> is often cited in connection with this promise, highlighting the eternal nature of God's covenant. Jesus, as a descendant of David, fulfills these promises, establishing an eternal kingdom and offering salvation to all who believe. This connection to David also reinforces Jesus' rightful place as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, fulfilling the messianic expectations of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who raised Jesus from the dead, affirming His power over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, to whom God made significant promises regarding his lineage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage, delivering a sermon in Pisidian Antioch.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pisidian_antioch.htm">Pisidian Antioch</a></b><br>A city in modern-day Turkey where Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel during their missionary journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_promises.htm">The Certainty of God's Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are reliable and fulfilled in Christ.

By raising Jesus, the Father confirmed Him as the imperishable Messiah and guaranteed the everlasting covenant.

To those, however, whose minds were full to overflowing with the writings of the prophets they would be pregnant with meaning. What were the "sure mercies of David" (<a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm" title="Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.">Isaiah 55:3</a>) but the "everlasting covenant" of mercy which was to find its fulfilment in One who should be "a leader and commander to the people?" We may well believe that the few words quoted recalled to St. Paul and to his hearers the whole of that wonderful chapter which opens with "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." The Greek word for "mercies" is the same adjective as that translated "holy" in the next verse, "holiness" being identified with "mercy," and so forms a connecting link with the prophecy cited in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Hath spoken</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">holy and sure blessings</span> for <span class="accented">sure mercies</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No more to return to corruption</span>. This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him."

And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "My mercy shall not depart from him." And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sure," or "established for ever," which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also <a href="/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though properly meaning "holy, pious," and thence "mild" and "merciful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., "the sure mercies of David;" the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, represents the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex. (quoted by Schleusner) uses it in the same way for "mercies or "benefits:" <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "<span class="accented">For</span> how many mercies are we indebted to Christ!" In a similar way, the Latin <span class="accented">pietas</span> is used for God's "justice" or "kindness" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). "Trini pulses pietatem" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): "Beat at the door of God's mercy." Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V. H.,' 8:1, where he ascribes to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the primitive sense of what is "just" and "due," from man either to God or to his fellowman, adds, "Tribuunt quidem LXX? interpetiam Deo <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: sod etiam tum significat quoddam quasi <span class="accented">offcium</span> benignitatia in heroines pios, Deo decorum." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In fact,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[God] raised</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anest&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
