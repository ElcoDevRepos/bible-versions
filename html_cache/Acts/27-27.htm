This prolonged period of distress highlights the severity of the situation and the endurance required by those on board.

This phrase indicates the lack of control the sailors had over the ship, emphasizing the power of the storm. Historically, this region was known for its treacherous waters, and the mention of being "driven" suggests a sense of helplessness and reliance on divine providence.<p><b>About midnight</b><br>"Midnight" often symbolizes a time of transition or divine intervention in the Bible. For instance, the Israelites were delivered from Egypt at midnight (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-31</a>). This timing sets the stage for a significant change in the narrative, suggesting that God&#8217;s intervention is imminent.<p><b>the sailors sensed they were approaching land</b><br>The sailors' ability to "sense" land indicates their experience and skill, as they likely detected changes in the sea or wind patterns. This moment of realization is crucial, as it marks a turning point from despair to hope. In a broader biblical context, land often represents safety and refuge, contrasting with the chaos of the sea.

God&#8217;s Word proves accurate down to the calendar.<p>&#8211; Endurance in prolonged hardship reflects the pattern seen in Scripture: Noah endured the forty-day flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Elijah walked forty days to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and believers are urged to &#8220;count it all joy&#8221; when trials are prolonged (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Driven&#8221; highlights total human helplessness; the storm, introduced in <a href="/acts/27-14.htm">Acts 27:14</a>, is still in charge. Yet aboard the ship is Paul, whose God &#8220;stills the roaring of the seas&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>).<p>&#8211; The Adriatic Sea designation fixes the narrative in real geography, emphasizing historical reliability. Luke consistently ties events to verifiable places (e.g., <a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>; 18:18), showing that the Lord works in actual history, not myth.<p>&#8211; Even while the vessel is out of control, Paul rests in God&#8217;s promise: &#8220;Not one of you will be lost&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty and human chaos can coexist; the former always prevails.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About midnight</b><p>&#8211; Midnight often represents the deepest darkness just before deliverance: Israel&#8217;s Passover rescue (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>), Samson&#8217;s escape (<a href="/judges/16-3.htm">Judges 16:3</a>), and Paul&#8217;s own prison praise in Philippi &#8220;about midnight&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s timing rarely aligns with human preference, but at the moment of greatest need He moves. <a href="/psalms/119-62.htm">Psalm 119:62</a> says, &#8220;At midnight I rise to give You thanks.&#8221; Luke again underscores the theme: deliverance comes when hope looks dimmest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sailors sensed they were approaching land</b><p>&#8211; Seasoned mariners could read the wind, waves, and perhaps hear breakers; natural perception now hints at God&#8217;s promised rescue drawing near.<p>&#8211; Their sensing is soon confirmed by soundings (<a href="/acts/27-28.htm">Acts 27:28</a>). Observation and faith converge: what God declared through Paul is now tangible.<p>&#8211; Yet human instincts alone prove insufficient; some sailors later try to abandon ship (<a href="/acts/27-30.htm">Acts 27:30</a>). God uses physical signs, but full salvation requires trusting His revealed word, just as Jesus urged Thomas to believe beyond sight (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-27.htm">Acts 27:27</a> spotlights God&#8217;s faithfulness amid extended, uncontrollable trial. After two unbearable weeks, in the darkest hour, tangible signs of deliverance appear exactly as God said. The verse encourages believers to endure, trust divine promises over circumstances, and look for God&#8217;s rescue even when still &#8220;driven&#8221; by forces beyond control.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">When the fourteenth night was come.</span>--The time is apparently reckoned from their leaving the Fair Havens.

So Ptolemy (iii. 16) speaks of the Adria as washing the south coast of the Peloponnesus and the east coast of Sicily (iii. 4). So Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, </span>c. 3), narrating his shipwreck, just two years after St. Paul's, on his voyage from Judaea to Puteoli, states that he was picked up by another ship sailing from Cyrene to the same port, "in the middle of Adria." The intersection of the lines of the two vessels would fall, as a glance at the map will show, within the region now mentioned by St. Luke under the same name.<p><span class= "bld">The shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they suspected, </span>or <span class= "ital">surmised, that a certain country was approaching them.</span> The sound of breakers, probably the white lines of foam seen through the darkness, gave rise, we may believe, to this impression. The country which they were nearing could hardly be any other than the head-land known as the Point of Koura, at the east extremity of St. Paul's, Bay, in Malta. To the Apostle the sight and the sound would alike witness that his prediction was on the point of fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- To and fro</span> for <span class="accented">up and down</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the sea of Adria</span> for <span class="accented">Adria</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sailors for shipmen</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">surmised for deemed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">were drawing</span> for <span class="accented">drew</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The fourteenth night</span>, reckoned from their leaving Fair Havens (so vers. 18, 19). <span class="cmt_word">Driven to and fro</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); it is rather <span class="accented">carried across</span>, or <span class="accented">along</span>, from one end to the other. <span class="cmt_word">Sea of Adria</span>. <span class="accented">Adria</span>, as in the A.V., is scarcely correct, as a translation of the Greek (though the Latins did call it <span class="accented">Adria</span>), because the nominative case in Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Adrias</span>, the Adriatic Gulf. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is the name of the town near the mouth of the Po, which gave its name to the Adriatic. As regards the use of term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the Adriatic, it is used in two ways: sometimes strictly of the Gulf of Venice, the Adriatic; sometimes, chiefly in latter writers, in a much wider sense, of the whole sea between Greece and Italy, including Sicily. This last is its use here. So, too, Josephus says that he was wrecked <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in the midst of the Adriatic, on his voyage from Caesarea to Puteoli, and was picked up by a ship from Cyrene.
