The resistance often came from Jewish leaders who felt threatened by the new teachings that challenged traditional Jewish beliefs and practices.<p><b>from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen</b><br>The Synagogue of the Freedmen likely consisted of Jews who were once slaves but had gained their freedom. These individuals may have been particularly zealous in their adherence to Jewish law, as they had a strong sense of identity and heritage to preserve. This synagogue was one of many in Jerusalem, serving as a place of worship and community for Jews from various regions.<p><b>including Cyrenians, Alexandrians</b><br>Cyrene was a city in North Africa, and Alexandria was a major city in Egypt. Both cities had significant Jewish populations. The mention of these groups highlights the diverse backgrounds of Jews in Jerusalem, reflecting the widespread dispersion of Jews throughout the Roman Empire. This diversity sometimes led to differing interpretations and practices within Judaism.<p><b>and men from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia</b><br>Cilicia and Asia were regions in what is now modern-day Turkey. The inclusion of these areas suggests that the synagogue was a gathering place for Hellenistic Jews, who were Greek-speaking and often more influenced by Greek culture. This cultural blend could lead to tensions with Hebraic Jews, who were more traditional.<p><b>They disputed with Stephen</b><br>Stephen was one of the seven deacons chosen to serve the early church, known for his wisdom and filled with the Holy Spirit. The disputes likely centered around theological issues, such as the interpretation of the Law and the role of Jesus as the Messiah. Stephen's teachings, which emphasized Jesus' fulfillment of the Law and the prophets, would have been controversial to those who held strictly to traditional Jewish beliefs. This confrontation foreshadows Stephen's eventual martyrdom, as recorded later in Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, chosen as one of the seven deacons to serve the early church.

Each of the names has a special interest of its own. (1) The <span class= "ital">Libertini.</span> These were freed-men, emancipated Roman Jews, with probably some proselytes, descendants of those whom Pompeius had led captive, and who were settled in the trans-Tiberine district of Rome in large numbers, with oratories and synagogues of their own. When Tacitus (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> ii. 85) describes the expulsion of the Jews under Claudius, he speaks of "four thousand of the freed-men, or <span class= "ital">Libertine</span> class," as banished to Sardinia. From this class, we have seen reason to believe, Stephen himself had sprung. Andronicus and Junias were probably members of this synagogue. (See Note on <a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Cyrenians.</span>--At Cyrene, also, on the north coast of Africa, lying between Egypt and Carthage, there was a large Jewish population. Strabo, quoted by Josephus, describes them as a fourth of the whole (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 7, ? 2). They were conspicuous for the offerings they sent to the Temple, and had appealed to Augustus for protection against the irregular taxes by which the provincial governors sought to intercept their gifts (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvi. 6, ? 5). In Simon of Cyrene we have had a conspicuous member, probably a conspicuous convert, of this community. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32</a>.) Later on, clearly as the result of Stephen's teaching, they are prominent in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles of Antioch. We may think of Simon himself, and his two sons Alexander and Rufus (<a href="/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>), as probably members of this society.<p><span class= "bld">Alexandrians.</span>--Next to Jerusalem and Rome, there was, perhaps, no city in which the Jewish population was so numerous and influential as at Alexandria. Here, too, they had their own quarter, assigned to them by Ptolemy Philadelphus, and were governed, as if they were a free republic, by an ethnarch of their own (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 7, ? 2). They were recognised as citizens by their Roman rulers (<span class= "ital">Ibid.</span> xiv. 10, ? 1). From Alexandria had come the Greek version of the Old Testament, known from the legend of the seventy translators who had all been led to a supernatural agreement, as that of the Septuagint, or LXX., which was then in use among all the Hellenistic Jews throughout the empire, and largely read even in Palestine itself. There, at this time, living in fame and honour, was the great teacher Philo, the probable master of Apollos, training him, all unconsciously, to be the preacher of a wisdom higher than his own. The knowledge, or want of knowledge, with which Apollos appears on the scene, knowing only the baptism of John, forbids the assumption that he had been at Jerusalem after the Day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/18-25.htm" title="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.">Acts 18:25</a>), but echoes of the teaching of Stephen are found in that of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and it is not improbable that thoughts had been carried back to Alexandria by those who had thus been brought under his influence.<p><span class= "bld">Of them of Cilicia.</span>--Here we feel at once the interest of the name. The young Jew of Tarsus, the disciple of Gamaliel, could not fail to be among the leading members of this section of the second synagogue, exercising, in the fiery energy of his zeal, a dominant influence even over the others. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain of them that were</span> for <span class="accented">certain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians</span> for <span class="accented">Cyrenians and Alexandrians</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Asia</span> for <span class="accented">of Asia</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Of the synagogue</span>, etc. There were said to have been four hundred and eighty synagogues in Jerusalem alone in the time of our Savior (Olshausen, on <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>). But this is probably a fanciful number; only it may be taken as an indication of the great number of such places of Jewish worship. Tiberias is said to have had twelve synagogues. Ten grown-up people was the minimum congregation of a synagogue. It seems by the enumeration of synagogues in our text that the foreign Jews had each their own synagogue at Jerusalem, as Chrysostom supposes, where men of the same nation attended when they came to Jerusalem; for the construction of the sentence is to supply before <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and again before <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> the same words as precede <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, SO as to mean "and certain of them that were of the synagogue called of the Cyrenians," and so on. The very numerous Jews of Cyrene and of Alexandria would doubtless require each a synagogue for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">The Libertines</span> were, as Chrysostom explains it, "freedmen of the Romans." They are thought to consist chiefly of the descendants of the Jews who were taken prisoners by Pompey, and deported to Rome, who were afterwards emancipated and returned to Judaea, though some (Meyer, 1:1) settled in Rome. Tacitus, under the year A.D. , speaks of four thousand Libertini, infected with Jewish or Egyptian superstitions, as banished to Sardinia ('Annal.,' 2. 85.). Many of these must have been Jews. Josephus, who tells the same story as Tacitus, though somewhat differently, says they were all Jews ('Ant. Jud.,' 18, 3:5). <span class="cmt_word">The Cyrenians</span>. Cyrene was the chief city in North Africa, and a great Jewish colony. Numbers of Jews were settled there in the time of Ptolemy Lagus ('Cont. Apion.,' 2:4), and are said by Josephus (quoting Strabo) to have been a fourth part of the inhabitants of the city ('Ant. Jud.,'14. 7:2). Josephus also quotes edicts of Augustus and of M. Agrippa, confirming to the Jews of Cyrene the right to live according to their own laws, and specially to send money for the temple at Jerusalem (16. 6:5). Jews from "the parts of Libya about Cyrene" are mentioned in <a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; Simon, who bore our Savior's cross, was "a man of Cyreue;" there were "men of Cyrene" at Jerusalem at the time of the persecution that arose about Stephen (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and "Lucius of Cyrene" is mentioned in <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>. It was natural, therefore, that the Cyrenians should have a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Alexandrians</span>. Alexandria had a Jewish population of 100,000 at this time, equal to two-fifths of the whole city. The famous Philo, who was in middle age at this time, was an Alexandrian, and the Alexandrian Jews were the most learned of their race. The Jews settled in Alexandria in the time of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Lagus. The LXX. Version of the Scriptures was made at Alexandria primarily for their use. We may be sure, therefore, that they had a synagogue at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And of them of Cilicia</span>. The transition from the African Jews to those of Asia is marked by changing the form of phrase into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x2e;</span> There were many Jews in Cilicia, and this doubtless influenced St. Paul in preaching there, as well as the fact of its being his own native province (see <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23, 41</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>). Josephus makes frequent mention of the Jews in the wars between the Ptolemies and Antiochus the Great, with whom the Jews sided, and in consequence were much favored by him. And it is thought that many who had been driven out from their homes by the wars, and others who were brought by him from Babylonia, settled in his time in Cilicia, as well as other parts of his Asiatic dominions. Seleucus also encouraged the Jews to settle in the towns of Asia in his kingdom, by giving them the freedom of the cities and putting them on an equal footing (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) with Macedonians and Greeks ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 3:1, 3). <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span>; meaning the same district as in <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a> (where see note). Evidence of the abundance of Jews in Asia crops up throughout the Acts (8. 16, 24, 42, 45; 14:19; 16:13; 18:26, 28; 19:17; 20:21). That the Jews of Asia were very bigoted we learn from <a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a> (see also <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">resistance arose</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anest&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
