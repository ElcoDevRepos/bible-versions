The command to preach is rooted in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations. The term "the people" initially referred to the Jews, but <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> marks a pivotal moment where the Gospel is extended to Gentiles, as seen in Peter's vision and his encounter with Cornelius. This expansion fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God declares that His salvation will reach the ends of the earth.<p><b>and to testify that He is the One appointed by God</b><br>The apostles are not only to preach but also to bear witness to Jesus' divine appointment. This echoes the role of witnesses in a legal setting, providing credible testimony to the truth. The phrase "appointed by God" underscores Jesus' divine authority and mission, as seen in His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>) and transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), where God affirms Jesus as His chosen one. This appointment is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as God's anointed.<p><b>to judge the living and the dead</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eschatological role of Jesus as the ultimate judge, a theme consistent throughout the New Testament (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). The concept of judgment was well understood in Jewish tradition, with God as the righteous judge of all humanity. Jesus' role as judge affirms His divinity and authority over all creation, both those who are alive at His return and those who have died. This judgment is not only punitive but also redemptive, offering eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage.
