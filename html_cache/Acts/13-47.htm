The context is Paul and Barnabas speaking in Antioch of Pisidia, where they faced opposition from the Jewish community. The use of "commanded" underscores the sense of obligation and divine mission, reflecting the Great Commission given by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. It also echoes the prophetic role of God's servants in the Old Testament, who were often given specific commands to fulfill God's purposes.<p><b>&#8216;I have made you a light for the Gentiles:</b><br>This phrase is a direct reference to <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is described as a light to the nations. In the original context, this referred to Israel's role in bringing knowledge of God to the world. In Acts, Paul applies this to the mission of the Church, indicating that the message of Jesus is for all people, not just the Jews. The imagery of light symbolizes guidance, revelation, and hope, contrasting with the darkness of ignorance and sin. Jesus Himself is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, and His followers are called to reflect that light.<p><b>to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of the Gospel. The "ends of the earth" signifies the farthest reaches of the known world, emphasizing the inclusivity of God's salvation plan. Historically, this reflects the expansion of the early Church beyond Jewish boundaries into Gentile territories, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a> and <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>. The concept of salvation here includes deliverance from sin and reconciliation with God, central themes in the New Testament. This mission aligns with the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his offspring (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, they were missionaries spreading the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.

Instead of retreating, they anchor their mission in a direct, divine mandate. <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> already had Jesus saying, &#8220;You will be My witnesses&#8230; to the ends of the earth&#8221;. <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a> echoes the same charge. By quoting a prophetic word, they show that their outreach to non-Jews is not a fallback plan but the very heart of God&#8217;s design. <a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you&#8221;. The command is clear: go.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have made you a light for the Gentiles</b><p>The phrase comes from <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Jesus&#8212;is appointed as &#8220;a light to the nations.&#8221; Paul and Barnabas see themselves reflecting that light. Jesus declared, &#8220;I am the light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and immediately told His followers, &#8220;You are the light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>). Light means revelation, hope, truth in a dark world. <a href="/acts/26-23.htm">Acts 26:23</a> shows Paul later using the same verse before King Agrippa, underscoring that the risen Christ shines through His people to all peoples.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bring salvation</b><p>Light is not merely illumination; it has a saving goal. <a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a> pictures Simeon rejoicing that his eyes have seen God&#8217;s salvation, &#8220;a light for revelation to the Gentiles&#8221;.

Paul&#8217;s later ambition was to preach where Christ was not yet named (<a href="/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20-21</a>). The vision culminates in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a countless multitude from every nation stands before the throne, proving that God&#8217;s plan reaches its intended horizon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a> weaves together command, identity, purpose, and scope. God commands His people to go; He appoints them as light bearers; He intends salvation, not mere information; and He targets every corner of the globe. Paul and Barnabas embraced that mandate in their day, and the verse still calls believers to shine Christ&#8217;s light, offer His salvation, and keep moving outward until every ethnic group has had the chance to rejoice in the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles.</span>--The context of the quotation has to be remembered as showing that St. Paul identified the "Servant of the Lord" in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a> with the person of the Christ.

The citation. is interesting as the first example of the train of thought which led the Apostle to see in the language of the prophets, where others had found only the exaltation of Israel, the divine purpose of love towards the whole heathen world.
