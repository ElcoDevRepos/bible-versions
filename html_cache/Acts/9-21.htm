Saul, later known as Paul, was a well-known persecutor of Christians, and his sudden change to a proponent of the faith was unexpected. This astonishment is a testament to the power of God to transform lives. The Greek word for "astounded" implies being struck with amazement, indicating the depth of their surprise. This reaction is similar to the amazement of the people in <a href="/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7</a> during Pentecost, showing how God's work often defies human expectations.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "wreaked havoc" suggests a violent and aggressive campaign against Christians. Saul's actions in Jerusalem were notorious, as he was known for his zealous persecution of the early church. This aligns with <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>, where Saul is described as ravaging the church, entering homes, and dragging off men and women to prison. The mention of Jerusalem highlights the centrality of the city in early Christian history and the significant threat Saul posed to the believers there.<p><b>on those who call on this name?</b><br>"Those who call on this name" refers to Christians, who were identified by their invocation of Jesus' name in prayer and worship. This phrase underscores the early Christian practice of calling upon Jesus as Lord, a key element of their faith. It also reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, which Peter cites in <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>, emphasizing that salvation comes to those who call on the name of the Lord. The use of "this name" indicates the reverence and power associated with the name of Jesus.<p><b>And hasn&#8217;t he come here to take them as prisoners</b><br>Saul's journey to Damascus was part of his mission to arrest Christians and bring them back to Jerusalem for trial. This reflects the legal authority he had from the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, to extradite believers. The mention of taking prisoners highlights the severity of the persecution and the lengths to which Saul was willing to go to suppress the Christian movement. This context is crucial for understanding the fear and suspicion that surrounded Saul's presence in Damascus.<p><b>to the chief priests?&#8221;</b><br>The chief priests were influential leaders in the Jewish religious hierarchy, responsible for maintaining religious order and authority. Saul's connection to them indicates his high standing and the official backing he had in his efforts against Christians. This relationship is significant, as it shows the institutional opposition the early church faced from Jewish authorities. The chief priests' involvement also underscores the perceived threat Christianity posed to traditional Jewish beliefs and practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.
