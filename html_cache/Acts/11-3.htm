It reflects the early church's struggle with integrating Gentile believers. The use of "said" indicates a verbal confrontation, highlighting the tension between Jewish customs and the new Christian faith.<p><b>&#8220;You visited uncircumcised men</b><br>The term "uncircumcised men" refers to Gentiles, who were not part of the Jewish covenant community. Circumcision was a sign of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>), and Jews traditionally avoided close association with Gentiles to maintain ritual purity. This phrase underscores the cultural and religious barriers that existed between Jews and Gentiles, which the early church had to navigate.<p><b>and ate with them.&#8221;</b><br>Eating with Gentiles was considered a significant breach of Jewish law and tradition, as it implied fellowship and acceptance. In Jewish culture, meals were a sign of community and shared values. By eating with Gentiles, Peter was demonstrating the breaking down of barriers through Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ as our peace, who has made both groups one. This act prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the church, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who played a crucial role in the early church.

Peter did not stumble into Gentile company; he went because God directed him (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; By visiting, Peter followed the pattern of Jesus, who &#8220;had to pass through Samaria&#8221; to meet the woman at the well (<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4&#8211;7</a>), showing that divine appointments often override cultural boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>uncircumcised men</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Uncircumcised&#8221; was Jewish shorthand for Gentiles&#8212;those outside the covenant sign given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; This label carried strong social and religious stigma (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11&#8211;12</a>). To many believers from a Jewish background, mingling with such people risked ceremonial impurity (<a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>; <a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God had just revealed to Peter, &#8220;What God has cleansed, you must not call impure&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), announcing a new era in which faith, not circumcision, marks God&#8217;s people (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ate</b><p>&#8226; Sharing a meal in the first century signified acceptance, friendship, and covenant fellowship (<a href="/luke/15-2.htm">Luke 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s willingness to sit at Cornelius&#8217;s table mirrored Jesus&#8217; ministry, where He &#8220;came eating and drinking&#8221; with tax collectors and sinners (<a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By eating, Peter demonstrated that the dietary restrictions which once separated Jews from Gentiles were fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with them</b><p>&#8226; The preposition underscores proximity and equality.

Peter&#8217;s obedience to God&#8217;s revelation affirmed that in Christ, external markers like circumcision no longer define God&#8217;s family. The verse highlights the gospel&#8217;s power to dissolve barriers, inviting all who trust Jesus into full fellowship without distinction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised.</span>--The words cannot well be translated otherwise, but the Greek (literally, <span class= "ital">men with a foreskin</span>) is somewhat more expressive of scorn than the merely negative form of the English.
