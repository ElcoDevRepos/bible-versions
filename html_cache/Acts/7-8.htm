This covenant is first introduced in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>, where God commands Abraham to circumcise every male in his household. Circumcision served as a constant reminder of God's promises to Abraham, including the promise of numerous descendants and the land of Canaan. It was a significant act of obedience and faith, symbolizing the cutting away of sin and the dedication to a holy life. This covenant is foundational in understanding the identity and religious practices of the Israelites.<p><b>and Abraham became the father of Isaac</b><br>Isaac was the child of promise, born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>. His birth was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would have a son through whom the covenant would continue (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). Isaac's name, meaning "laughter," reflects the joy and disbelief of his parents at his miraculous birth. Isaac is a type of Christ in that he was the promised son, and his near-sacrifice by Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a> prefigures the sacrifice of Jesus.<p><b>and circumcised him on the eighth day</b><br>Circumcision on the eighth day was a command from God (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>) and became a standard practice for the Israelites. The eighth day is significant in Jewish tradition, symbolizing a new beginning and completion. It is also medically significant, as it is the time when an infant's blood clotting ability is at its peak. This practice was a sign of obedience to God's covenant and was later reaffirmed in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>). The New Testament references circumcision as a metaphor for spiritual purity and dedication to God (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>).<p><b>And Isaac became the father of Jacob</b><br>Jacob, later named Israel, is a central figure in the biblical narrative. His life is detailed in <a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25-35</a>, where he is depicted as a complex character who wrestles with God and man. Jacob's twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve tribes of Israel, making him a pivotal link in the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. Jacob's story is one of transformation and redemption, as he moves from being a deceiver to a man who seeks God's blessing and favor.<p><b>and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs</b><br>The twelve patriarchs refer to the sons of Jacob, who are the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their stories are recounted in <a href="/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-50</a>, with each son playing a unique role in the unfolding of God's plan for His people. The patriarchs are significant in biblical history as they represent the foundation of the nation of Israel. Their lives are marked by both faith and failure, illustrating the complexities of human nature and God's sovereignty in using imperfect people to accomplish His purposes. The twelve tribes are later referenced throughout the Bible, including in the prophetic visions of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God gave the covenant of circumcision, marking the beginning of a special relationship between God and Abraham's descendants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham, who was circumcised on the eighth day as a sign of the covenant, continuing the lineage of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac, who fathered the twelve patriarchs, forming the foundation of the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_patriarchs.htm">The Twelve Patriarchs</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who became the leaders of the twelve tribes of Israel, each tribe playing a significant role in the history of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_of_circumcision.htm">Covenant of Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, symbolizing their unique relationship and commitment to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_covenants.htm">The Significance of Covenants</a></b><br>Covenants in the Bible are sacred agreements that establish a relationship between God and His people.
