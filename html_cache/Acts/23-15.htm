It held significant religious and political power. This phrase indicates a collaboration between the conspirators and the Sanhedrin, highlighting the extent of opposition Paul faced from Jewish leaders. The Sanhedrin's involvement underscores the tension between early Christians and Jewish authorities, as seen throughout Acts.<p><b>petition the commander</b><br>The commander referred to here is Claudius Lysias, the Roman tribune in charge of maintaining order in Jerusalem. Petitioning him shows the conspirators' attempt to manipulate Roman authority for their purposes. This reflects the complex relationship between Jewish leaders and Roman officials, where Jewish leaders sometimes sought Roman intervention to maintain control or eliminate threats.<p><b>to bring him down to you</b><br>This phrase indicates a request for Paul to be brought from the Roman barracks to the Sanhedrin. The physical movement from the barracks to the council would have been a short journey within Jerusalem, emphasizing the geographical proximity yet significant political and religious divide between Roman and Jewish authorities.<p><b>on the pretext of examining his case more carefully</b><br>The conspirators planned to deceive the commander by pretending to seek a more thorough investigation of Paul's case. This tactic of deceit highlights the lengths to which Paul's opponents were willing to go to eliminate him. It also reflects the broader theme of false accusations against Christians, as seen in the trials of Jesus and other apostles.<p><b>We are ready to kill him on the way.</b><br>This assassination plot reveals the extreme hostility Paul faced due to his preaching of the Gospel. It echoes previous threats against Jesus and other apostles, showing a pattern of violent opposition to the Christian message. The readiness to commit murder underscores the perceived threat Paul posed to traditional Jewish beliefs and the lengths to which his opponents would go to silence him. This plot also foreshadows the many dangers Paul would face in his ministry, as he himself later recounts in his letters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_council_and_the_sanhedrin.htm">The Council and the Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling body, consisting of religious leaders and elders, responsible for maintaining Jewish law and order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commander.htm">The Commander</a></b><br>Refers to the Roman military officer in charge of keeping peace and order in Jerusalem, particularly concerning Roman interests.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the target of the plot, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plotters.htm">The Plotters</a></b><br>A group of more than forty Jews who conspired to kill Paul, taking an oath not to eat or drink until they had succeeded.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, a central location for Jewish religious life and early Christian activity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_opposition.htm">The Reality of Opposition</a></b><br>Believers should expect opposition when standing for the truth of the Gospel.

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> only occurs here and at ver. 22, in this sense of "signifying" or "making known" something, which it has in <a href="/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>, LXX.. Codex Alexandrinus (as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to tell), and in 2 Macc. 3:7, and in Josephus, as also in classical Greek. Elsewhere in the New Testament it means "to manifest," or "show," as in <a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21, 22</a>; in the passive voice "to appear," as in <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>; and in a technical legal sense "to give information" (<a href="/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>; <a href="/acts/25-2.htm">Acts 25:2, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Judge of his case more exactly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. The word only occurs here and in <a href="/acts/24-22.htm">Acts 24:22</a>.
