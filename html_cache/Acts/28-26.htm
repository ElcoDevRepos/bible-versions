In <a href="/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, Paul uses this passage to address the Jewish leaders in Rome, highlighting their spiritual stubbornness. The phrase underscores the continuity of God's message through His prophets and apostles, emphasizing the persistent call to repentance and faith. It reflects the mission of God's messengers to speak truth, even when faced with resistance.<p><b>You will be ever hearing but never understanding</b><br>This phrase indicates a spiritual condition where the message of God is heard but not comprehended. It reflects a hardened heart and a refusal to accept divine truth. Historically, this was a common issue among the Israelites, who often heard the prophets but failed to grasp the spiritual implications of their messages. This condition is not limited to the Jewish people of Isaiah's or Paul's time but is a universal human problem. It serves as a warning against complacency and the danger of becoming desensitized to God's voice.<p><b>You will be ever seeing but never perceiving</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this highlights a spiritual blindness. Despite witnessing God's works and miracles, the people fail to recognize His hand and understand His purposes. This can be seen throughout the biblical narrative, such as in the ministry of Jesus, where many witnessed His miracles but did not perceive Him as the Messiah. It underscores the necessity of spiritual insight, which comes from a heart open to God's revelation. This condition is a fulfillment of prophecy and serves as a type of Christ's rejection by His own people, as He often taught in parables to reveal truth to those with open hearts while concealing it from those who were spiritually blind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/bsb/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, Paul is under house arrest in Rome, yet continues to preach the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The setting of <a href="/bsb/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, where Paul is held captive.

Looking to the fact that this implies a wide currency given to the prophecy in all reports, oral or written, of our Lord's teaching, and that St. Paul was clearly well acquainted with one collection of our Lord's discourses (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>), we can hardly resist the inference that he now applied them as following in the track of his Master's teaching. What was true of the Jews of Jerusalem was true also of those of Rome. In both there was a wilful blindness and deafness to that which ought to have produced conviction and conversion. (Comp. the language which the Apostle had previously used in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Go <span class="accented">thou</span> for go, A.V.; <span class="accented">by hearing</span> for <span class="accented">hearing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in no wise</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall in no wise</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Go thou</span>, etc. The quotation is all but <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>.
