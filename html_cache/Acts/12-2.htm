This James is not to be confused with James, the brother of Jesus, who became a leader in the Jerusalem church. James, the son of Zebedee, was one of the first disciples called by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21-22</a>). His martyrdom marks a significant moment as he is the first apostle to be martyred, highlighting the increasing persecution of the early church.<p><b>the brother of John</b><br>James and John were known as the "sons of Zebedee" and were given the nickname "Boanerges," meaning "sons of thunder," by Jesus (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>). This indicates their zealous and passionate nature. John, his brother, would later become a prominent figure in the early church and is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of John, three epistles, and the Book of Revelation.<p><b>put to death with the sword</b><br>The method of execution, by the sword, suggests a Roman influence, as beheading was a common Roman practice for capital punishment. This act was carried out under the authority of Herod Agrippa I, who sought to gain favor with the Jewish population by persecuting the church (<a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12:1-3</a>). The execution of James fulfills Jesus' earlier prophecy that James would indeed "drink the cup" of suffering (<a href="/mark/10-39.htm">Mark 10:39</a>).

Decapitation showed, as in the case of John the Baptist, that the sentence was pronounced by a civil ruler, adopting Roman modes of punishment, and striking terror by them in proportion as they were hateful to the Jews. The death of James reminds us of his Lord's prediction that he, too, should drink of His cup, and be baptised with His baptism (<a href="/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>). The fulfilment of that prophecy was found for one brother in his being the proto-martyr of the apostolic company, as it was found for the other in his being the last survivor of it. What led to his being selected as the first victim we can only conjecture; but the prominent position which he occupies in the Gospels, in company with Peter and John, probably continued, and the natural vehemence indicated in the name of Son of Thunder may have marked him out as among the foremost teachers of the Church. The brevity of St. Luke's record presents a marked contrast to the fulness of later martyrologies. A tradition preserved by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 9) as coming from Clement of Alexandria, records that his accuser was converted by beholding his faith and patience, confessed his new faith, and was led to execution in company with the Apostle, who bestowed on him the parting benediction of "Peace be with thee."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">James</span>, the son of Zebedee, or <span class="cmt_word">James the Elder</span>, to whom, with his brother John, our Lord gave the surname of Boanerges (which is a corruption of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), sons of thunder. Nothing is recorded of him in the Acts but his presence in the upper room at Jerusalem after the Ascension (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), and this his martyrdom, which was the fulfillment of our Lord's prediction in <a href="/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23</a>. His being singled out by Herod for death in company with Peter is rather an indication of his zeal and activity in the Lord's service, though we know nothing of his work. Eusebius relates an anecdote of his martyrdom, extracted from the lost work of Clement of Alexandria, called the <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (or in Latin <span class="accented">Adumbrationes</span>), which Clement professed to have received by tradition from his predecessors, to the effect that the informer who accused James was so struck with his constancy in confessing Christ before the judge, that he came forward and confessed himself a Christian too. The two were then led off to execution together; and on the way the informer asked James's forgiveness. After a moment's hesitation, James said to him, "Peace be unto thee," and kissed him. They were then both beheaded ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 9.). As Clement flourished about A.D. , the tradition need not have passed through more than three persons. It has been thought strange that Luke relates the death of a chief apostle with such brevity. But it did not bear on the main object of his work. Lightfoot ('Works,' vol. 8. p. 282, etc.) mentions a fanciful story related by Rabauus Maurus, that about this time the apostles composed the Apostles' Creed, each contributing one clause, and that the clause contributed by James the brother of John was, "And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{He had} James,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#946;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Iak&#333;bon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2385.htm">Strong's 2385: </a> </span><span class="str2">The same as Iakob Graecized; Jacobus, the name of three Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
