The Sanhedrin was composed of chief priests, elders, and scribes, and it held significant authority in Jewish society. This was not the first time Peter and John were brought before them, indicating the council's persistent concern over the apostles' activities. The repeated summoning underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and Jewish religious authorities.<p><b>and commanded them</b><br>The Sanhedrin's command reflects their authoritative position and their attempt to exert control over religious teachings in Jerusalem. Commands from the Sanhedrin were expected to be obeyed, as they were seen as the guardians of Jewish law and tradition. This command is a direct challenge to the apostles' mission, highlighting the conflict between human authority and divine commission.<p><b>not to speak or teach</b><br>The prohibition against speaking or teaching is significant, as it targets the core activities of the apostles. Speaking and teaching were essential for spreading the message of Jesus and establishing the early church. This restriction is an attempt to suppress the growing influence of the apostles and the spread of Christianity. It also reflects the fear of the authorities that the new teachings could undermine their power and the established religious order.<p><b>at all</b><br>The phrase "at all" emphasizes the totality of the prohibition. The Sanhedrin sought to completely silence the apostles, indicating the seriousness with which they viewed the threat posed by the new movement. This absolute ban highlights the extent of the opposition faced by the early church and the determination of the authorities to maintain control.<p><b>in the name of Jesus</b><br>The name of Jesus is central to the apostles' message and mission. In Jewish culture, a name carried significant meaning and authority. The apostles performed miracles and preached in Jesus' name, signifying His power and presence. The Sanhedrin's specific prohibition against using Jesus' name underscores their recognition of its power and their desire to prevent its influence from spreading. This conflict over the name of Jesus is a recurring theme in Acts, illustrating the early church's commitment to proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were spreading the Gospel and performing miracles in His name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, consisting of religious leaders who were threatened by the apostles' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, a central location for early Christian activity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_of_the_lame_man.htm">The Healing of the Lame Man</a></b><br>The miracle that led to Peter and John's arrest and subsequent trial before the Sanhedrin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_jesus.htm">The Name of Jesus</a></b><br>Central to the apostles' message and the source of their authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god_over_man.htm">Obedience to God Over Man</a></b><br>The apostles' response to the Sanhedrin's command highlights the importance of prioritizing God's commands over human authority when they conflict.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_name.htm">The Power of Jesus' Name</a></b><br>The Sanhedrin's fear of the apostles' teaching underscores the transformative and authoritative power inherent in the name of Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_persecution.htm">Courage in the Face of Persecution</a></b><br>Peter and John's boldness serves as an example for believers to stand firm in their faith, even when facing opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The apostles' ability to speak boldly and perform miracles is a testament to the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witnessing.htm">The Importance of Witnessing</a></b><br>Despite the threats, the apostles continued to witness for Christ, emphasizing the critical role of evangelism in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_4_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 4:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_4_18_God_s_will_vs_human_rules.htm">How does Acts 4:18 challenge us to prioritize God's commands over human authority?
