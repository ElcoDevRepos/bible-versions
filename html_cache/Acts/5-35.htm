It highlights their shared heritage and covenant relationship with God. The term "Men of Israel" is often used in the Old Testament to call attention to the collective responsibility and identity of the Jewish people (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2</a>). It serves as a reminder of their history and the law given to them through Moses.<p><b>he said,</b><br>The speaker here is Gamaliel, a respected Pharisee and teacher of the law. He is known for his wisdom and moderate stance, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>. Gamaliel was a member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, and is historically recognized as a mentor to Saul of Tarsus, who later became the Apostle Paul (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>). His authority and influence lend weight to his words.<p><b>consider carefully</b><br>This phrase is a call to deliberate thought and reflection. It suggests a pause for wisdom and discernment before taking action. In the biblical context, it echoes the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which often advises careful consideration and seeking God's guidance before making decisions (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>what you are about to do</b><br>Gamaliel urges the council to think about the consequences of their actions. This reflects a principle found throughout Scripture: the importance of understanding the potential outcomes of one's decisions. It also aligns with the biblical theme of justice and mercy, encouraging leaders to act with fairness and compassion (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>to these men.</b><br>The "men" referred to are the apostles, who were preaching about Jesus Christ and performing miracles in His name. The apostles were seen as a threat to the religious establishment, yet Gamaliel's advice suggests a more measured approach. This moment is pivotal in the early church's history, as it underscores the tension between the new Christian movement and traditional Jewish authority. Gamaliel's counsel ultimately leads to the apostles' release, allowing the spread of the Gospel to continue.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gamaliel.htm">Gamaliel</a></b><br>A respected Pharisee and teacher of the law, known for his wisdom and moderate stance.

Gamaliel, aware that &#8220;the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), urges them to weigh the matter in the light of God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what you are about to do</b><p>The council stands on the brink of decisive action&#8212;beating or even executing the apostles.<p>&#8226;

His counsel anticipates his later warning: &#8220;If this plan is of men, it will be overthrown.
