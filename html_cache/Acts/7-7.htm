The historical context is the period of Israelite slavery in Egypt, which lasted approximately 400 years. The punishment came through the ten plagues and the eventual destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea (Exodus 7-14). This demonstrates God's justice and His commitment to His covenant with Abraham. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to execute judgment.<p><b>God said,</b><br>This emphasizes the divine authority and certainty of the promise. It is a direct quote from God, highlighting the prophetic nature of the statement. The phrase assures the reader of the reliability of God's word, as seen throughout Scripture. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God speaking to His people, as seen in the prophets and ultimately through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><b>and afterward they will come forth</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, where the Israelites were delivered from slavery and led out of Egypt by Moses. It is a pivotal event in Israel's history, symbolizing redemption and liberation. Theologically, it prefigures the ultimate deliverance from sin through Jesus Christ. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Bible as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (e.g., <a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37-45</a>).<p><b>and worship Me in this place.</b><br>"This place" refers to the land of Canaan, the Promised Land, which God had promised to Abraham and his descendants. Worshiping God in the Promised Land signifies the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of Israel as a nation dedicated to Him. It also foreshadows the centrality of worship in the life of believers, both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament Church. The concept of worship is expanded in the New Testament to include worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>), indicating a shift from a specific location to a spiritual relationship with God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who promises to judge the nation that enslaves His people and to deliver them for worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nation.htm">Nation</a></b><br>Refers to Egypt, where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slavery.htm">Slavery</a></b><br>The condition of the Israelites in Egypt, symbolizing oppression and bondage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance.htm">Deliverance</a></b><br>The act of God freeing the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, leading them to worship Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/worship.htm">Worship</a></b><br>The ultimate purpose of deliverance, highlighting the importance of worshiping God in freedom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment_and_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment and Deliverance</a></b><br>God is in control of history and nations.

God told Moses, &#8220;When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>).<p>- Stephen, speaking before the Sanhedrin, points to that same sacred space where true worship centers on God&#8217;s presence, not a building (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48&#8211;49</a>).<p>- Deliverance positions people to honor the Redeemer&#8212;moving from forced labor to joyful service (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-7.htm">Acts 7:7</a> reassures that God judges oppressors, keeps His word, liberates His people, and draws them into wholehearted worship.

What St. Stephen does is to substitute with the natural freedom of a narrative given from memory the words "they shall serve me" for the simpler phrase, "they shall come hither again," of Genesis. The whole context is at variance with the assumption that St. Stephen meant the last words of the verse to be taken as applying to the mount of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Which</span> for <span class="accented">whom</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And serve me in this place</span>.
