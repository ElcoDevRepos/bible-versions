The healing took place at the temple gate called Beautiful, where Peter and John encountered the man. This miracle is significant as it demonstrates the power of Jesus' name and the authority given to the apostles. The healing serves as a testament to the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, which speaks of the lame leaping like a deer. It also highlights the continuation of Jesus' ministry through His apostles.<p><b>standing there with them</b><br>The healed man standing with Peter and John is a powerful visual testimony to the miracle that had occurred. His presence is undeniable evidence of the apostles' divine authority and the truth of their message. In the cultural context of the time, physical healing was often seen as a sign of divine favor or intervention. The man's ability to stand, something he had never done before, underscores the completeness of his healing and the authenticity of the apostles' witness.<p><b>they had nothing to say in response</b><br>The religious leaders, who were questioning Peter and John, found themselves unable to refute the miracle. This silence indicates their inability to deny the power and authority of the apostles' message. It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>, where He assures His followers that He will give them words and wisdom that their adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict. The leaders' silence also highlights the growing tension between the early Christian movement and the established religious authorities, setting the stage for further conflict and persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were preaching the resurrection of Jesus and performing miracles in His name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>A man who had been lame from birth and was healed by Peter and John at the temple gate called Beautiful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, including the high priests, elders, and scribes, who were questioning Peter and John about their authority and actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, specifically at the temple, a central place of worship and authority for the Jewish people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle.htm">The Miracle</a></b><br>The healing of the lame man, which served as undeniable evidence of the power of Jesus' name and the truth of the apostles' message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_transformed_life.htm">The Power of a Transformed Life</a></b><br>The healed man standing with Peter and John was undeniable evidence of God's power.
