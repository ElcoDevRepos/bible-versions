This reflects a recurring pattern in his ministry, where he often encountered resistance from Jews who rejected his message about Jesus as the Messiah. This opposition is consistent with the broader narrative of Acts, where the early church frequently faced hostility. The Greek word for "opposed" suggests an active resistance, while "insulted" indicates verbal abuse, highlighting the intensity of the rejection Paul experienced.<p><b>he shook out his garments</b><br>Shaking out one's garments was a symbolic act of disassociation and rejection. In Jewish culture, this gesture was akin to shaking the dust off one's feet, a practice Jesus instructed His disciples to perform when leaving a town that did not welcome them (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>). It signified a clear break and a declaration that the responsibility for rejecting the message lay with the hearers.<p><b>and told them, &#8220;Your blood be on your own heads!</b><br>This phrase echoes Old Testament language, particularly from <a href="/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4</a>, where the watchman is absolved of responsibility if he warns the people and they do not heed the warning. Paul is declaring that he has fulfilled his duty to preach the gospel to them, and their rejection means they bear the responsibility for their own spiritual fate.<p><b>I am innocent of it.</b><br>Paul asserts his innocence, indicating that he has done all he can to convey the message of salvation. This statement underscores the seriousness of rejecting the gospel and the accountability of those who hear it. It also reflects Paul's clear conscience in his mission, as he has faithfully delivered the message entrusted to him.<p><b>From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&#8221;</b><br>This marks a significant shift in Paul's ministry strategy in Corinth, as he turns his focus to the Gentiles. While Paul consistently began his ministry in new cities by preaching in synagogues, this decision reflects a broader pattern in Acts where the gospel increasingly spreads to the Gentile world. This transition fulfills the prophecy and mission given to Paul to be a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>), aligning with the overarching theme of the book of Acts, which documents the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this passage.

Assuming what has been suggested in the Note on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>, we may think of these disturbances as reproducing what had already taken place at Rome. We may, perhaps, trace an echo of such blasphemies in the words "Anathema be Jesus," of which St. Paul speaks in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a> as having been uttered as with the vehemence of a simulated inspiration, against which men needed to be warned.<p><span class= "bld">He shook his raiment.</span>--On the symbolic significance of the act, see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-14.htm" title="And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.">Matthew 10:14</a>.

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-25.htm" title="Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.">Matthew 27:25</a>.) We can hardly think of the Apostle as using them without a distinct recollection of the language which defined the responsibility of a prophet of the truth in <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-18.htm" title="When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.">Ezekiel 3:18-19</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Shook out</span> for <span class="accented">shook</span>, A.V.
