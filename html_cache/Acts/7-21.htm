This act of faith by his mother is a significant moment of divine providence, as it sets the stage for Moses' future role as the deliverer of Israel. The act of setting Moses outside can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also sent into the world to deliver His people.<p><b>Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter took him</b><br>Pharaoh's daughter, though unnamed in the biblical text, plays a crucial role in God's plan for Moses. Her compassion and decision to adopt Moses defy her father's edict, highlighting the theme of God's sovereignty and the unexpected ways He accomplishes His purposes. This act of taking Moses can be seen as a divine intervention, ensuring Moses' survival and preparation for his future leadership. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God using unlikely individuals to fulfill His plans.<p><b>and brought him up as her own son</b><br>Moses was raised in the Egyptian royal household, receiving an education and upbringing that would later equip him for his leadership role. This upbringing in Pharaoh's court provided Moses with knowledge of Egyptian culture, language, and governance, which would be instrumental in his interactions with Pharaoh and the eventual exodus of the Israelites. This phrase also foreshadows Moses' dual identity as both an Egyptian prince and a Hebrew, which becomes a central tension in his life and mission. Moses' adoption into the royal family can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though divine, took on human nature and lived among us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew child born during a time when Pharaoh had decreed that all Hebrew male infants be killed.
