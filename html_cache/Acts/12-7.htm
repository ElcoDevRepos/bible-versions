Angels are often depicted as God's agents in executing His will, emphasizing His sovereignty and power. This event occurs during a time of persecution, highlighting God's protection over His apostles.<p><b>and a light shone in the cell.</b><br>The light symbolizes God's presence and revelation, often associated with divine truth and guidance (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). In a literal sense, the light would have been necessary for Peter to see, but metaphorically, it represents the illumination of God's intervention in a dark situation. This imagery is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's presence is accompanied by light (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, <a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a>).<p><b>He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up,</b><br>The gentle action of tapping Peter suggests a personal and caring approach by the angel, reflecting God's intimate concern for His servants. Peter's deep sleep, despite his impending execution, indicates his trust in God (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>). The act of waking Peter signifies a call to action, a theme seen throughout Scripture where God awakens His people to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-7</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8220;Get up quickly.&#8221;</b><br>The urgency in the angel's command underscores the immediacy of God's deliverance. It reflects the need for prompt obedience to divine instructions, a principle seen in other biblical narratives (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15-16</a>, <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-14</a>). This command also foreshadows the rapid unfolding of events that lead to Peter's escape, demonstrating God's control over time and circumstances.<p><b>And the chains fell off his wrists.</b><br>The miraculous release from chains symbolizes liberation from bondage, a recurring theme in Scripture that points to spiritual freedom through Christ (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). This physical liberation prefigures the greater spiritual deliverance that Jesus provides. The falling of the chains without human intervention highlights the power of God to break any form of captivity, both physical and spiritual.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early church.

As at the empty tomb (<a href="/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>) and with Paul in the storm (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>), the Lord dispatches an angel to accomplish His purpose.<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that nothing hinders God from acting instantaneously&#8212;see <a href="/daniel/3-24.htm">Daniel 3:24-25</a> when the fourth figure joins the three men in the fire without warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a light shone in the cell</b><p>&#8226; Light often signals divine presence (<a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). In a dark prison, this literal brightness affirms that God&#8217;s glory penetrates any darkness.<p>&#8226; The soldiers remain oblivious (<a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a>), echoing how Saul&#8217;s companions saw the light but did not understand the voice (<a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>). The Lord can reveal or conceal as He chooses (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the scene assures believers that God&#8217;s illumination reaches the bleakest circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up</b><p>&#8226; The gentle touch shows personal care. Peter sleeps so soundly that physical contact is required&#8212;evidence of supernatural peace (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>) despite imminent execution.<p>&#8226; God often awakens His servants for decisive moments: Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3-10</a>), Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-7</a>), Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-6.htm">Jonah 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s rest mirrors his earlier trust when he slept during a storm at Jesus&#8217; side (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), demonstrating matured faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;Get up quickly.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Obedience must be immediate.
