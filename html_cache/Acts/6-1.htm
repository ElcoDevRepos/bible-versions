The term "disciples" refers to the followers of Jesus who were committed to His teachings. This growth is a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and beyond. The increase in numbers can be attributed to the work of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a> and <a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>, where thousands were added to the church. This growth also reflects the effectiveness of the apostles' preaching and the communal life of the believers.<p><b>the Grecian Jews among them began to grumble against the Hebraic Jews</b><br>The Grecian Jews, or Hellenists, were Jews who spoke Greek and had adopted some aspects of Greek culture. They were likely from the Diaspora, living outside of Judea and returning to Jerusalem. The Hebraic Jews were native to Judea and spoke Aramaic or Hebrew. This distinction highlights cultural and linguistic differences within the early church, which could lead to misunderstandings and tensions. The grumbling indicates a complaint or murmuring, a term used in the Old Testament to describe the Israelites' complaints in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7-8</a>).<p><b>because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food</b><br>Widows in the ancient world were often vulnerable and dependent on community support, as they had limited means to provide for themselves. The early church took on the responsibility of caring for widows, reflecting the biblical mandate to care for the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). The "daily distribution" refers to the communal sharing of resources, a practice established in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>. The oversight of the Grecian widows suggests an administrative challenge in the growing church, necessitating a solution to ensure equitable care for all members. This situation sets the stage for the appointment of the seven deacons in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3-6</a>, demonstrating the church's commitment to justice and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Refers to the early followers of Jesus who were growing in number.

Now they were becoming a prominent section of the Church, perhaps more numerous than the Hebrews, or Jews of Palestine. They, as their name implies, spoke Greek habitually, and as a rule did not read the older Hebrew or speak the current Aramaic. They read the Septuagint (LXX.) version of the Old Testament. They were commonly more zealous, with the zeal of pilgrims, for the sanctity of the holy places than the Jews of Jerusalem itself, who had been familiar with them from infancy (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Now in these</span> for <span class="accented">and in those</span>, A.V.
