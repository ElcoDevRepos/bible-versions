In the context of <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, Peter is speaking to Cornelius, a Roman centurion, which signifies the opening of the Gospel to the Gentiles. This is a pivotal moment in the early church, as it marks the shift from a predominantly Jewish faith to a global mission. The Old Testament foreshadows this inclusivity, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations. The geographical context of the Roman Empire, with its vast and diverse population, underscores the significance of this message reaching "every nation."<p><b>who fear Him</b><br>The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with reverence, awe, and obedience to God. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that a proper understanding of God starts with a reverent attitude. In the cultural context of the first-century Mediterranean world, fear of deities was common, but the biblical concept involves a relationship based on respect and love rather than terror. This phrase emphasizes that God values a heart that acknowledges His sovereignty and holiness, regardless of cultural or ethnic background.<p><b>and do what is right</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of righteous living as evidence of genuine faith. In the biblical context, righteousness is not merely about following rules but living in a way that reflects God's character. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reinforces this by stating that faith without works is dead, highlighting the inseparable link between belief and action. The historical context of <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> shows that Cornelius was already known for his good deeds and almsgiving, which prepared him to receive the Gospel. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of doing the will of the Father (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>). The call to "do what is right" transcends cultural norms and points to a higher standard set by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion in Caesarea, known for his devoutness and fear of God.

Peter has just learned that &#8220;God does not show favoritism&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The word &#8220;welcomes&#8221; tells us the Lord actively receives, not reluctantly tolerates.<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;Whoever comes to Me I will never drive away&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul adds, &#8220;For God does not show favoritism&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This welcoming nature is rooted in the Father&#8217;s promise that &#8220;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p>Peter&#8217;s revelation corrects any notion that salvation is limited by ethnicity, status, or prior religious background. The gracious invitation is extended to all who respond in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those from every nation</b><p>The phrase sweeps the entire globe into God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; God told Abraham, &#8220;All the families of the earth will be blessed through you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus commanded, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; In heaven John saw &#8220;a great multitude&#8230;from every nation, tribe, people, and language&#8221; worshiping the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<p>No culture is excluded; the gospel crosses every border. Peter is standing in a Gentile household (Cornelius&#8217;s), proving that &#8220;in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who fear Him</b><p>Here is the inner attitude God looks for&#8212;reverent awe that takes Him seriously.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary rejoiced that &#8220;His mercy extends to those who fear Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Malachi records God&#8217;s promise to those &#8220;who feared the LORD and honored His name&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>Fear in this sense is not terror but humble recognition of God&#8217;s holiness, authority, and right to rule. It turns the heart toward repentance and faith, just as Cornelius &#8220;prayed to God continually&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And do what is right</b><p>True reverence produces obedient action.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He has shown you, O man, what is good&#8230;to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; James urges believers to be &#8220;doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; John writes, &#8220;The one who practices righteousness is righteous&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>).<p>Peter is not teaching salvation by works; he is describing the evidence of saving faith. Cornelius&#8217;s prayers and almsgiving (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>) showed a heart already stirred by God&#8217;s grace. When the gospel is heard, those who truly fear God respond with repentance and trust in Christ (<a href="/acts/10-43.htm">Acts 10:43&#8211;48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a> reveals a God who eagerly receives anyone, anywhere, who approaches Him with reverent trust that leads to righteous living. The verse celebrates God&#8217;s impartial grace, the global reach of the gospel, the necessity of heartfelt fear of the Lord, and the outward proof of inward faith. Peter&#8217;s words invite every reader to embrace Jesus, the Savior welcomed by all who fear God and practice what is right through His enabling power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">In every nation he that feareth him.</span>--The great truth which Peter thus proclaimed is obviously far-reaching in its range. It applies, not to those only who know the name of Christ and believe on Him when He is preached to them, but to all who in all ages and countries "fear God" according to the measure of their knowledge, and "work righteousness" according to their belief and opportunities. The good works in such a case, are, in their measure and degree, as "fruits of faith, and follow after justification" (Article XII.), justification having been, in such cases, objectively bestowed for the merits of Christ, and subjectively appropriated by the faith which, in the Providence of God, was possible under the conditions of the case. They do not come under the head of "works done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of His Spirit" (Article XIII.), for Christ is "the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>), and the Spirit is to every man "the Lord, and giver of life," and the works are done "as God hath willed and commanded them to be done." What such men gain by conversion is a fuller knowledge of the Truth, and therefore a clearer faith, a fuller justification, and a higher blessedness, but as this history distinctly teaches, they are already accepted with God. They are saved, "not by the law or sect which they profess" (Article XVIII.), but, even though they know not the Name whereby they must be saved (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm" title="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.">Acts 4:12</a>), by Christ, who is the Saviour of all. The truth which St. Peter thus set forth proclaims at once the equity and the love of the Father, and sweeps away the narrowing dreams which confine the hope of salvation to the circumcised, as did the theology of the Rabbis; or to those who have received the outward ordinance of baptism, as did the theology of Augustine and the Mediaeval Church; or, as do some forms of Protestant dogmatism, to those who have heard and believed the story of the Cross of Christ. The language of St. Paul in <a href="/context/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9-14</a> should, however, be compared with this, as showing that the higher knowledge brings with it an incomparably higher blessedness, and that the man first tastes the full meaning of "salvation" when he consciously calls on the Lord by whom he has been saved.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="accented">- Acceptable to</span> for <span class="accented">accepted with</span>, A.V. As regards the truth that <span class="cmt_word">God is no respecter of persons</span>, which the present incident had brought home so vividly to Peter's apprehension, there can be no difficulty in understanding it. Cornelius was devout, he feared God, he was fruitful in prayer and almsgiving. God did not say to him, "All this would have been accepted in a Jew, but cannot be noticed in a Gentile." But, Gentile as he was, his prayers and alms went up for a memorial before God. If the things done were good in themselves, they were equally good whoever did them. God is no respecter of persons to accept or reject one or another, because of <span class="accented">who he is</span>, and not because of <span class="accented">what he does</span> (<a href="/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>).
