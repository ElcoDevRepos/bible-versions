This reflects the early Christian practice of community and mutual aid, as seen in other parts of Acts (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25, 20</a>:4). The presence of escorts indicates the potential dangers Paul faced, highlighting the hostility towards the Gospel in certain regions.<p><b>brought him to Athens</b><br>Athens was a significant cultural and intellectual center of the ancient world, known for its philosophical schools and rich history. By the time of Paul&#8217;s visit, it was a city steeped in idolatry, which Paul later addresses in his speech at the Areopagus (<a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>). This setting provides a backdrop for the clash between Greek philosophy and the Christian message.<p><b>and then returned with instructions</b><br>The return of the escorts with instructions underscores the strategic planning involved in Paul&#8217;s missionary work.

Their partnership exemplifies the model of discipleship and mentorship in the early church. Timothy, in particular, is a significant figure, later becoming a leader in the church and recipient of Paul&#8217;s pastoral letters (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy).<p><b>as soon as possible</b><br>The urgency in Paul&#8217;s request highlights the pressing nature of his mission and the challenges he faced in Athens. It reflects the early church&#8217;s commitment to spreading the Gospel rapidly and effectively, often in the face of opposition. This urgency is mirrored in other parts of Acts, where the apostles act swiftly to respond to the Holy Spirit&#8217;s leading (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-40, 16</a>:9-10).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, in its primary sense, means to "place any one" in a given spot; and thence secondarily, to "conduct" or" escort" any one to a place, to "set him down" at such a place. So Homer ('Odyssey,' 13:294) uses the word of transporting any one by ship to this or that town (quoted by Meyer). There is the indication in the word of St. Paul's defect of sight or infirmity. <span class="cmt_word">Receiving a commandment</span>, etc. We learn here that St. Paul sent a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at Athens as quickly as possible, and at ver. 16 that he waited at Athens for them. From <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2</a>, we learn that he sent Timothy from Athens back to Thessalonica; and from <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a> we learn that Timothy came to St. Paul at Corinth (where the Epistle to the Thessalonians was written) from Thessalonica. We also learn from <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a> that Silas and Timothy were both with him at Corinth when he wrote the Epistle, and from <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> that they had both come to Corinth from Macedonia, some weeks after Paul himself had been at Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4, 5</a>). All these statements harmonize perfectly (as Paley has shown) on the supposition that Silas and Timothy did join St. Paul at Athens; that for the reasons given in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3</a>, when he was unable to return to Thessalonica himself, as he much wished, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica, and Silas probably to Beraea; and that Silas and Timothy came together from Macedonia to Corinth, where St. Paul had gone alone; where it may be noted, as another undesigned coincidence, that whereas the First Epistle to the Thessalonians implies that Silas did <span class="accented">not</span> go to Thessalonica (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy came from <span class="accented">Thessalonica</span>, but from <span class="accented">Macedonia.</span> The inaccuracy supposed by Meyer (on this verse) is purely imaginary. <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy "only joined Paul at Corinth," but merely relates some change in St. Paul's procedure consequent upon their joining him at Corinth. Alford (on this verse), in saying that Paul sent Timothy from Beraea, not from Athens, is guided by his own idea of what is probable, not by the letter of the narrative (see further note on Acts 18:5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Those who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
