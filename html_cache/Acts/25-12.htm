This reflects the Roman practice of consulting a consilium for important decisions, ensuring that the governor's actions were legally sound and politically wise. The council's role highlights the Roman emphasis on law and order, contrasting with the often arbitrary justice systems of other ancient cultures. This consultation underscores the gravity of Paul's appeal and the potential implications for Roman governance in Judea.<p><b>and replied, &#8220;You have appealed to Caesar.</b><br>Paul's appeal to Caesar was a legal right of Roman citizens, allowing them to have their case heard by the emperor in Rome. This appeal was significant because it shifted the jurisdiction from a local to an imperial level, demonstrating the privileges of Roman citizenship. Historically, this appeal was made to Nero, who was emperor at the time. Theologically, Paul's appeal can be seen as part of God's providential plan to spread the Gospel to the heart of the Roman Empire, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> that Paul would bear His name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.<p><b>To Caesar you will go!&#8221;</b><br>Festus's decision to send Paul to Caesar aligns with Roman legal procedures, where an appeal to the emperor was binding. This phrase marks a pivotal moment in Paul's ministry, as it sets the stage for his journey to Rome, a key location for the spread of Christianity. Theologically, this journey can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ, as Paul, like Jesus, is unjustly accused and must face trial, yet his journey is part of a divine plan for the salvation of many.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/festus.htm">Festus</a></b><br>Porcius Festus was the Roman governor of Judea, succeeding Felix.

In like manner, Pliny (quoted by Kuinoel) says of certain Christians who had appealed to Caesar, that, "because they were Roman citizens, he had thought it right to send them to Rome for trial" ('Epist.,' 10:97). Festus, though, maybe, rather startled by Paul's appeal, was perhaps not sorry to be thus rid of a difficult case, and at the same time to leave the Jews under the impression that he himself was willing to send the prisoner for trial to Jerusalem, had it been possible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/25-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
