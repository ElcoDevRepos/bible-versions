This filling is a repeated experience for believers, empowering them for specific tasks and witness. The Holy Spirit's role is crucial in the early church, guiding, teaching, and emboldening the apostles. This moment reflects the transformative power of the Spirit, as Peter, once fearful, now speaks with confidence.<p><b>said to them,</b><br>Peter addresses the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which includes the high priest, elders, and scribes. This setting is significant as it mirrors the trial of Jesus, where Peter previously denied knowing Him. Now, empowered by the Spirit, Peter stands firm. The act of speaking before such a powerful group highlights the courage and conviction that comes from divine empowerment.<p><b>&#8220;Rulers and elders of the people!</b><br>Peter acknowledges the authority of the Sanhedrin, showing respect for their positions. This address is formal and respectful, yet it sets the stage for a bold proclamation of the gospel. The rulers and elders were responsible for maintaining religious order and interpreting the law, making them key figures in Jewish society. Peter's address to them is strategic, as it provides an opportunity to witness to those who hold significant influence over the people. This moment also fulfills Jesus' words in <a href="/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12-15</a>, where He foretold that His followers would testify before rulers and authorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his boldness and leadership in the early church.

The conjunction shows a seamless continuation of God&#8217;s work&#8212;no pause in His plan.<p>&#8226; Peter, once fearful and denying Christ (<a href="/luke/22-54.htm">Luke 22:54-62</a>), now stands firm. Jesus had promised, &#8220;You will be My witnesses&#8230;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This verse shows that promise being lived out in real time.<p>&#8226; Leadership mantle: Jesus told Peter, &#8220;Feed My sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). Acts repeatedly highlights Peter stepping into that role (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>; 3:12; 5:29).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God often uses specific individuals at decisive moments, yet the focus remains on His power working through them (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Filled with the Holy Spirit</b><p>&#8226; The phrase recalls Pentecost where &#8220;they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). Luke underscores that Peter&#8217;s courage and clarity flow from divine empowerment, not human confidence.<p>&#8226; Being filled is not a one-time event; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a> shows another filling for the gathered believers. God supplies fresh power whenever His people face new challenges (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Boldness flows from dependence on the Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29-31</a>).<p>&#8211; The Spirit equips ordinary believers for extraordinary witness (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8211; Obedience invites ongoing filling (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Said to them</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;said&#8221; seems simple, yet it highlights proclamation.

Respectful address fulfills his later teaching: &#8220;Honor the king&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming them, he calls them personally to account. The gospel demands decision from every rank of society, including leaders (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s approach illustrates how believers engage culture:<p>&#8211; Acknowledge legitimate structures (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>).<p>&#8211; Appeal to shared history and Scripture (<a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a> cites <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Stand firm when obedience to God conflicts with human commands (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a> captures a Spirit-empowered moment where Peter steps forward, emboldened by God, to address Israel&#8217;s highest authorities. The verse showcases: immediate obedience (&#8220;Then&#8221;), divine empowerment (&#8220;filled with the Holy Spirit&#8221;), bold proclamation (&#8220;said to them&#8221;), and respectful confrontation of earthly power (&#8220;Rulers and elders of the people!&#8221;). It reminds believers that the same Spirit equips us today to speak truth with courage and grace, no matter the audience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost.</span>--The tense implies an immediate sudden inspiration, giving the wisdom and courage and words which were needed at the time.

The coincidence of names in the juxtaposition of the representatives of the new and the older Israel is striking. On each side there was a John; on each a Cephas, or Caiaphas, the two names possibly coming from the same root, or, at any rate, closely alike in sound. A few weeks back Peter had quailed before the soldiers and servants in the high priest's palace. Now he stands before the Sanhedrin and speaks, in the language of respect, it is true, but also in that of unflinching boldness. We may, perhaps, trace a greater deference in the language of the Galilean fisherman, "Ye rulers of the people," than in the "Men and brethren" of St. Paul (<a href="/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>), who was more familiar with the members of the court, and stood in less awe of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Elders</span> for <span class="accented">elders of Israel</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Filled with the Holy Ghost;</span> in direct fulfillment of the promise (<a href="/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>; <a href="/luke/12-12.htm">Luke 12:12</a>; <a href="/luke/21-14.htm">Luke 21:14, 15</a>; comp. <a href="/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>).
