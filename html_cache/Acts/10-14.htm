This reflects his deep commitment to the Mosaic Law, which he has followed all his life. The use of "Lord" signifies Peter's recognition of divine authority, yet his refusal shows the tension between his traditional beliefs and the new revelation being presented to him. This moment highlights the struggle early Jewish Christians faced in reconciling their heritage with the expanding understanding of God's plan.<p><b>Peter answered.</b><br>Peter's role as a leader among the apostles is evident here. His response is personal and direct, showing his active engagement in the vision. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Peter is being prepared to take the gospel to the Gentiles, a significant shift in the early church's mission. Peter's answer also reflects his character as someone who is not afraid to question and seek understanding, as seen in other parts of the New Testament.<p><b>&#8220;I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores Peter's adherence to Levitical laws found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which outline clean and unclean animals. These dietary laws were a significant part of Jewish identity and religious practice, serving to set the Israelites apart from other nations. Peter's declaration of never having eaten anything impure or unclean highlights his faithfulness to these laws. This moment is pivotal as it challenges the early church to move beyond Jewish customs and embrace a new covenant where such distinctions are no longer necessary. This vision prepares Peter for his encounter with Cornelius, a Gentile, and signifies the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as further explained in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.
