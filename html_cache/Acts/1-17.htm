The selection of the twelve apostles is significant as it mirrors the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing a new covenant community. Judas's inclusion among the apostles highlights the theme of betrayal and the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which foreshadows the betrayal by a close friend. His role among the apostles underscores the reality of human free will and the presence of sin even within the chosen group.<p><b>and shared in this ministry.</b><br>Judas participated in the ministry of Jesus, which included preaching, healing, and performing miracles. This involvement emphasizes the gravity of his betrayal, as he was not an outsider but an integral part of Jesus' mission. The term "ministry" here refers to the service and work of spreading the Gospel, a task entrusted to the apostles. Judas's participation in this ministry serves as a warning about the dangers of hypocrisy and the importance of genuine faith. His actions ultimately fulfilled the Scriptures, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which prophesies the betrayal for thirty pieces of silver.
