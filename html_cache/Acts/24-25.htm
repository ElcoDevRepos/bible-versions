Righteousness refers to living in accordance with God's standards, a concept deeply rooted in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>) and fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>). Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>) and essential for Christian living, contrasting with the indulgent lifestyle of the Roman elite. The coming judgment is a central eschatological theme, emphasizing accountability before God (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Paul's message would have been particularly poignant to Felix, a Roman governor known for his corruption and moral laxity, highlighting the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>Felix became frightened</b><br>Felix's fear indicates the convicting power of the Holy Spirit working through Paul's words. Despite his political power, Felix is confronted with the reality of divine judgment, which transcends earthly authority. This reaction is reminiscent of other biblical figures who trembled at God's message, such as King Belshazzar (<a href="/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>). Felix's fear underscores the universal nature of the Gospel's call to repentance and the unsettling truth of impending judgment for those outside of Christ.<p><b>and said, &#8220;You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.&#8221;</b><br>Felix's response reveals a common human tendency to procrastinate spiritual decisions. His dismissal of Paul reflects a reluctance to confront personal sin and the demands of the Gospel. This mirrors the parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>), who also delayed spiritual matters. Felix's postponement serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of delaying repentance and the urgency of responding to God's call. His decision to send Paul away highlights the tension between worldly concerns and eternal truths, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on trial, speaking to Felix about the Christian faith, emphasizing righteousness, self-control, and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/felix.htm">Felix</a></b><br>The Roman governor who is listening to Paul.

Scripture insists that &#8220;the righteous will live by faith&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>) and that &#8220;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Felix, a Roman governor used to corruption, suddenly heard that real righteousness is measured by God&#8217;s own character (<a href="/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s message echoed Jesus&#8217; call in <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a> that our righteousness must surpass mere outward religion.<p>&#8226; He would have pointed to Christ, &#8220;who knew no sin but became sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>Felix learned that righteousness is not optional; it is a divine demand fulfilled only through faith in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Self-control</b><p>Having laid the standard, Paul turned to how believers live it out. Self-control is listed among the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>) and is expected of everyone who names Christ (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul often illustrated this with athletic imagery: &#8220;Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For a ruler like Felix, who was notorious for indulgence, the call to restrain passions must have hit hard.<p>The gospel never excuses sin; it transforms lives to say &#8220;No&#8221; to it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the coming judgment</b><p>Paul then moved to the inevitable consequence: &#8220;He has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man He has appointed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> reminds us, &#8220;people are appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> pictures &#8220;the dead, great and small, standing before the throne,&#8221; their deeds reviewed.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself said, &#8220;all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come out&#8230; to resurrection of judgment&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>).<p>Judgment is certain, individual, and eternal. Paul&#8217;s words left no middle ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Felix became frightened</b><p>Conviction pierced Felix. Like those at Pentecost who were &#8220;cut to the heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>), or Herod who &#8220;feared John&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>), Felix felt the weight of truth.<p>&#8226; He realized that God&#8217;s standard, Spirit-enabled self-control, and coming judgment exposed his soul.<p>&#8226; Scripture does not record repentance&#8212;only fear. Conviction without surrender leaves a person in peril.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.&#8221;</b><p>Felix&#8217;s response was delay. <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a> warns, &#8220;Do not boast about tomorrow.&#8221; Paul wrote, &#8220;Now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Excuses and procrastination plague many who sense God&#8217;s call (<a href="/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-62</a>).<p>&#8226; Felix thought he controlled the schedule; in reality, each moment of delay was mercy he presumed upon.<p>The tragedy of <a href="/bsb/acts/24.htm">Acts 24</a> is that Scripture never records Felix calling for Paul to settle the matter of his soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a> shows Paul presenting the gospel in three clear steps&#8212;God&#8217;s righteous standard, Spirit-empowered self-control, and the unavoidable coming judgment. Felix&#8217;s fear proves that the message struck home, yet his postponement warns us that conviction without commitment is spiritually fatal. Today remains the only guaranteed moment to receive the righteousness offered freely in Christ and to live in self-controlled readiness for the judgment to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Righteousness, temperance, and judgment.</span>--The first word, like our English "justice," includes in Greek ethics the duties which man owes <span class= "ital">to</span> man. "Temperance" answers to a term with a somewhat wider sense than that which now attaches to the English word, and implies the state in which a man exercises control over all the passions that minister to sensuality, while he yet falls short of a perfect harmony between Reason and Emotion (Aristot. <span class= "ital">Eth. Nicom.</span> vii. 7-10). What has been said of Felix shows how faulty his character was in both these respects. The selection of the unwelcome topics shows how little St. Paul belonged to the class of those who "compassed sea and land to make a proselyte" (<a href="/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>). It would apparently have been easy to bring about this result with Felix and his wife, had the preacher been content to speak smooth things and prophecy deceits, to put the patch of a ceremonial Judaism on the old garment of a sensual life; but instead of this he presses home the truths which their state needed, and seeks to rouse conscience to something like activity. His own experience (<a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7-23</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.">Philippians 3:7-8</a>), had taught him that, without this, neither doctrine nor ritual availed to deliver the soul from its bondage to evil, and bring it into the kingdom of God. But he does not confine himself, as a merely ethical teacher might have done, to abstract arguments on the beauty or the utility of "justice" and "temperance." Here, also, his own experience was his guide, and he sought to make the guilty pair before whom he stood feel that the warnings of conscience were but the presage of a divine judgment which should render to every man according to his deeds. It will be noted that there is no mention here of the forgiveness of sins, nor of the life of fellowship with Christ. Those truths would have come, in due course, afterwards. As yet they would have been altogether premature. The method of St. Paul's preaching was like that of the Baptist, and of all true teachers.<p><span class= "bld">Felix trembled, and answered . . .</span>--Conscience, then, was not dead, but its voice was silenced by the will which would not listen. Felix treats St. Paul as Antipas had treated the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm" title="For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.">Mark 6:20</a>). He does not resent his plainness of speech; he shows a certain measure of respect for him, but he postpones acting "till a more convenient season," and so becomes the type of the millions whose spiritual life is ruined by a like procrastination. Nothing that we know of him gives us any ground for thinking that the "convenient season" ever came.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- And temperance</span> for <span class="accented">temperance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the judgment</span> for <span class="accented">judgment</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was terrified</span> for <span class="accented">trembled</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and when</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">call thee unto me</span> for <span class="accented">call for thee</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/24-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[As]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Paul]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
