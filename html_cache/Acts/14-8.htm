It was a frontier town, known for its diverse population, including Greeks, Romans, and native Lycaonians. The city was part of Paul's first missionary journey, as recorded in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13-14</a>. Lystra was significant for its lack of a Jewish synagogue, indicating a predominantly Gentile population. This setting highlights the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish communities, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>there sat a man crippled in his feet</b><br>The description of the man's condition emphasizes his helplessness and the severity of his disability. In biblical times, physical disabilities often led to social marginalization and economic hardship, as there were limited means for support. This phrase sets the stage for a miraculous healing, demonstrating God's power and compassion. The man's condition parallels other biblical accounts of healing, such as the man at the pool of Bethesda (<a href="/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2-9</a>).<p><b>who was lame from birth</b><br>Being lame from birth underscores the congenital nature of the man's condition, making the impending miracle even more remarkable. This detail highlights the authenticity of the miracle, as it was not a temporary ailment but a lifelong disability. The phrase echoes other scriptural accounts of congenital conditions, such as the man born blind in <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-7</a>, where Jesus' healing serves as a testament to His divine authority.<p><b>and had never walked</b><br>The emphasis on the man's inability to walk from birth further accentuates the miraculous nature of his healing. This detail underscores the totality of his disability and the transformative power of the Gospel. The healing of such a condition would have been seen as impossible by human standards, pointing to the divine intervention of God. This phrase connects to prophecies of the Messiah bringing healing and restoration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the lame are prophesied to leap like a deer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lystra.htm">Lystra</a></b><br>A city in the region of Lycaonia, part of modern-day Turkey.

God often highlights one person to display His grace, as He did with the Ethiopian eunuch in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-39</a>.<p>&#8226; Sitting suggests passivity and helplessness&#8212;he was not seeking Jesus, yet Jesus was about to seek him, echoing <a href="/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11</a>, &#8220;There is no one who seeks God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The man&#8217;s anonymity allows every reader who feels overlooked to see himself in the story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>crippled in his feet</b><p>&#8226; The Holy Spirit stresses the severity: his disability affected both feet, leaving him immobilized.<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates the miracle to come, much like the &#8220;man lame from birth&#8221; at the temple gate whom Peter healed (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical brokenness pictures spiritual brokenness; apart from Christ we are &#8220;dead in trespasses and sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was lame from birth</b><p>&#8226; Congenital lameness underscores that no human remedy or gradual therapy had ever helped him.<p>&#8226; His condition parallels the man born blind in <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-7</a>; both cases prove that some afflictions exist &#8220;that the works of God might be displayed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By specifying &#8220;from birth,&#8221; Luke rules out fakery and magnifies the Creator who alone can give what was never present.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had never walked</b><p>&#8226; This triple emphasis&#8212;crippled, from birth, never walked&#8212;heightens anticipation.<p>&#8226; It mirrors Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy, &#8220;Then the lame will leap like a deer&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), showing that Messianic signs did not end with Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry but continued through His church.<p>&#8226; The impossibility of the situation spotlights the sufficiency of faith; when Paul perceives the man &#8220;had faith to be healed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>), God&#8217;s power meets human trust, similar to <a href="/mark/2-5.htm">Mark 2:5</a> where Jesus responds to visible faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8</a> sets an unmistakable stage: a real city, an overlooked sufferer, a lifelong incapacity. By painting the need in bold strokes, the verse prepares us to see the glory of Christ working through His servants. God chooses an impossible case so that when the man leaps up (<a href="/acts/14-10.htm">Acts 14:10</a>), everyone knows the gospel is not words alone but &#8220;the power of God for salvation&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Being a cripple from his mother's womb.</span>--We note, as in <a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>; <a href="/acts/9-33.htm" title="And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.">Acts 9:33</a>, the characteristic care to record the duration of the infirmity which was supernaturally cured.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- At Lystra there sat</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">there sat</span>... <span class="accented">at Lystra</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a cripple</span> for <span class="accented">being a cripple</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
