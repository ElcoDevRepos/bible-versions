Stephen had just delivered a powerful sermon, recounting Israel's history and accusing the Jewish leaders of resisting the Holy Spirit and betraying and murdering the Righteous One, Jesus Christ. This moment marks the climax of their anger and rejection of his message.<p><b>they covered their ears</b><br>Covering their ears symbolizes a refusal to listen or accept what is being said. In Jewish culture, this act can be seen as a way to avoid hearing blasphemy. Stephen's declaration that he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God was perceived as blasphemous by the Jewish leaders, who were strict monotheists and could not accept Jesus as divine. This act of covering their ears is reminiscent of the rejection of the prophets in the Old Testament, who were often ignored or persecuted for speaking God's truth.<p><b>cried out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud cry signifies an emotional and vehement rejection of Stephen's words. It reflects the intensity of their anger and their collective outrage. This reaction is similar to the crowd's response during Jesus' trial, where they shouted for His crucifixion. The loud voice also serves to drown out Stephen's words, further emphasizing their unwillingness to hear the truth.<p><b>and rushed together at him</b><br>The phrase indicates a sudden and violent action. The Sanhedrin, typically a deliberative body, abandons its usual decorum in a frenzied mob-like behavior. This rush towards Stephen is a physical manifestation of their spiritual blindness and hard-heartedness. It parallels the mob mentality seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the crowd's demand for Barabbas over Jesus. This act of rushing together also foreshadows the persecution that the early church would face, as seen in the subsequent chapters of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, full of faith and the Holy Spirit, who was delivering a powerful speech to the Sanhedrin, recounting Israel's history and accusing them of resisting the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council and court that was responsible for religious and legal matters.
