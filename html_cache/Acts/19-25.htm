The craftsmen and workmen in related trades were likely involved in creating silver shrines and idols of Artemis, which were popular among pilgrims and worshippers. This assembly indicates the economic impact of the Christian message, as Paul's teachings were turning people away from idol worship, threatening their livelihood. The gathering of these tradesmen highlights the interconnectedness of religion and economy in ancient Ephesus, where the worship of Artemis was not only a spiritual practice but also a significant economic driver.<p><b>&#8220;Men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know that this business is our source of prosperity.</b><br>Demetrius appeals to the economic interests of his fellow craftsmen, emphasizing the financial threat posed by the spread of Christianity. The phrase "source of prosperity" underscores the dependency of their wealth on the continued worship of Artemis. This reflects a broader theme in Acts, where the gospel challenges existing social and economic structures. The concern for prosperity also echoes the biblical warning against the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) and the potential conflict between serving God and wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).

By gathering the craftsmen, he unites those directly threatened by the gospel&#8217;s advance in Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-18.htm">Acts 19:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; This is an intentional strategy, much like the owners of the fortune-telling slave girl who seized Paul in Philippi when their profits vanished (<a href="/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The text records a real historical event; Scripture literally portrays how the spread of truth exposes false religion and stirs opposition (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Demetrius chooses fellow artisans rather than civil authorities first, mirroring how sinful interests often rally like-minded allies before seeking broader support (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the workmen in related trades</b><p>He widens the circle beyond silversmiths to any laborers who profit from Artemis worship&#8212;metalworkers, engravers, vendors.<p>&#8226; Idolatry was a lucrative, interconnected industry in Ephesus, home to the famed temple of Artemis (<a href="/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The ripple effect shows how sin weaves economic networks; compare the merchants who mourn the fall of Babylon when their trade collapses (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; By involving &#8220;related trades,&#8221; Demetrius ensures a sizable, sympathetic crowd, similar to how Sanballat enlisted surrounding peoples against Nehemiah&#8217;s rebuilding work (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Men</b><p>A short but deliberate form of address.

Like the crowd in <a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> fearing loss of position, his priority is material security.<p>&#8226; The early believers had already burned costly magic scrolls (<a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>). Their sacrificial stand contrasts sharply with Demetrius&#8217; greed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/19-25.htm">Acts 19:25</a> records a calculated, profit-driven appeal that rallies an industry against the gospel. Demetrius unites craftsmen and allied workers, addressing them as &#8220;Men&#8221; to strengthen group resolve, and centers his argument on threatened prosperity. The verse illustrates how the faithful proclamation of Jesus disrupts entrenched economic systems of idolatry, revealing where true allegiance lies. Cross-references show this pattern throughout Scripture: when truth shines, those whose hope rests in earthly gain resist. God&#8217;s Word stands literal and accurate, exposing hearts and calling believers to value Christ above all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The workmen of like occupation.</span>--The "craftsmen" of the previous verse represent the higher class of what we call skilled labour.

The opening words of Demetrius bring before us, with an almost <span class= "ital">naive</span> simplicity, the element of vested interests which has at all times played so prominent a part in the resistance to religious and political reforms, and entered largely into the persecutions against which the early preachers of the gospel had to contend. Every city had its temples and priests, its flamens, its oracles or sanctuaries. Sacrifices and feasts created a market for industry which would otherwise have been wanting. In its later development, the Christian Church, employing the services of art, encouraging pilgrimages, organising conventual and collegiate institutions, created a market of another kind, and thus gave rise to new vested interests, which in their turn were obstacles to the work of reformation. At first, however, the absence of the aesthetic element in the aims and life of the Church seemed to threaten those who were occupied in such arts with an entire loss of livelihood, and roused them to a fierce antagonism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Gathered</span> for <span class="accented">called</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bust. ness</span> for <span class="accented">craft</span>, A.V., but "craft" is the better rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Workmen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, different from the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> skilled laborers or artisans.
