Cornelius, a Roman centurion, was a God-fearing man who sought the truth. This invitation was divinely orchestrated, as Cornelius had received a vision instructing him to send for Peter. The act of inviting Peter, a Jew, into a Gentile's home was culturally significant, breaking traditional Jewish customs that discouraged such interactions.<p><b>I came without objection</b><br>Peter's willingness to go to Cornelius's house without objection demonstrates his obedience to the Holy Spirit's guidance. This is a pivotal moment, as Peter had just received a vision from God, teaching him that what God has made clean should not be called impure. This vision prepared Peter to overcome his cultural prejudices and embrace the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith. His immediate response reflects a heart transformed by divine revelation, aligning with the broader narrative of Acts where the Gospel transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries.<p><b>I ask, then, why have you sent for me?</b><br>Peter's question to Cornelius is both practical and rhetorical. It invites Cornelius to articulate his understanding of the divine encounter and sets the stage for the revelation of God's plan for the Gentiles. This moment underscores the theme of divine initiative in the spread of the Gospel, as God orchestrates events to bring about His purposes. It also highlights the importance of communication and understanding in the mission of the Church. Peter's inquiry is a model of humility and openness, seeking to understand God's will in the unfolding situation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.

The phrase points back to Peter&#8217;s willingness to heed an invitation that would have been unthinkable for a devout Jew&#8212;entering a Gentile household (cf. <a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records that Peter &#8220;called them in and gave them lodging&#8221; the night before (<a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>), showing immediate hospitality that mirrors Christ&#8217;s open invitation to all (<a href="/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s acceptance illustrates God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration of events and the fulfillment of His promise that the gospel would reach the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>;

Peter obeys promptly because the Holy Spirit explicitly told him, &#8220;Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-20.htm">Acts 10:20</a>).<p>&#8226; His obedience contrasts with Jonah&#8217;s earlier reluctance to preach to Nineveh; Peter models the right response&#8212;swift compliance (<a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The lack of objection signals a heart transformed by the vision that declared all foods&#8212;and by extension all people&#8212;clean (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: When God&#8217;s Word clarifies His will, believers are to move forward in faith, even when cultural norms push back (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I ask, then, why have you sent for me?</b><p>&#8220;

By letting Cornelius speak first, Peter honors him and demonstrates humility (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The query also underlines personal responsibility: though God initiates, individuals must respond and explain their need (<a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; This exchange prepares both parties for mutual revelation&#8212;Cornelius learns salvation through Christ; Peter grasps God&#8217;s impartiality (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-29.htm">Acts 10:29</a> captures Peter&#8217;s Spirit-led obedience, his readiness to cross cultural boundaries, and his humble invitation for Cornelius to share God&#8217;s purpose.
