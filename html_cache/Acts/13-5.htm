It was a significant commercial hub, which made it a strategic location for spreading the Gospel. The choice of Salamis as a starting point for the mission reflects the early church's strategy of targeting urban centers where the message could spread rapidly. The presence of a large Jewish community in Salamis is evidenced by the mention of synagogues, indicating a well-established Jewish population.<p><b>they proclaimed the word of God</b><br>The proclamation of the word of God refers to the preaching of the Gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. This was the central mission of Paul and Barnabas, as they sought to fulfill the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The focus on the word of God underscores the importance of Scripture and the message of salvation as the foundation of their ministry.<p><b>in the Jewish synagogues</b><br>The synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life and a natural starting point for Paul and Barnabas, who were both Jewish. By beginning their ministry in the synagogues, they were able to connect with those who were already familiar with the Scriptures and the prophecies concerning the Messiah. This approach is consistent with Paul's later practice of going "to the Jew first" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The synagogue setting provided a platform for dialogue and debate, allowing the apostles to present Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<p><b>And John was with them as their helper</b><br>John, also known as John Mark, was a relative of Barnabas (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>) and is traditionally identified as the author of the Gospel of Mark. His role as a helper suggests he assisted in logistical and practical matters, supporting the mission of Paul and Barnabas. This partnership highlights the importance of teamwork and the diverse roles within the early church. John's presence also foreshadows later events, as he would eventually part ways with Paul, leading to a significant moment of contention (<a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/salamis.htm">Salamis</a></b><br>A city on the eastern coast of Cyprus, significant as the first location where Paul and Barnabas preached during their missionary journey.
