This body held significant religious and political power. The apostles had just testified about Jesus' resurrection and accused the Council of being responsible for His death. This bold proclamation challenged the authority and beliefs of the Council, particularly the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection.<p><b>they were enraged</b><br>The Greek term used here conveys a deep, visceral anger. The apostles' message not only accused the Council of wrongdoing but also threatened their authority and theological positions. This reaction is consistent with the Council's previous responses to challenges, as seen in their dealings with Jesus and Stephen. The anger also reflects the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that often accompanies rejection of the gospel.<p><b>and they resolved to put the apostles to death</b><br>This resolution mirrors the Council's earlier decision regarding Jesus, highlighting a pattern of violent opposition to perceived threats. The apostles' unwavering testimony and miraculous signs were seen as a direct challenge to the Council's power. This decision also fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution and even death for His name (<a href="/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17-22</a>).

God exalted Him&#8230; to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29-31</a>).<p>&#8226; These leaders have been confronted with their own guilt in Jesus&#8217; death, a message that echoes Peter&#8217;s earlier words in <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> and <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14-15</a>.<p>&#8226; Similar confrontations had already stirred them: after the lame man&#8217;s healing they &#8220;commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, truth pierces hardened hearts&#8212;see Stephen&#8217;s speech that &#8220;cut to the heart&#8221; of the council (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>) and Jesus&#8217; parables that led chief priests to &#8220;look for a way to arrest Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-19.htm">Luke 20:19</a>).<p>The verse reminds us that whenever God&#8217;s Word is proclaimed plainly, it demands a response; neutrality is not an option (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were enraged</b><p>Luke records that the council members were &#8220;incensed&#8221; (literally &#8220;sawn through&#8221;), signaling deep fury.<p>&#8226; Rage has frequently marked opposition to God&#8217;s messengers: the synagogue in Nazareth was &#8220;filled with rage&#8221; and tried to throw Jesus off a cliff (<a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28-29</a>); later, Stephen&#8217;s audience gnashed their teeth (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>).<p>&#8226; This anger is more than emotion; it is spiritual hostility. Jesus warned, &#8220;If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern underscores the cost of faithful witness&#8212;Paul later lists such hostility among his sufferings (<a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11-12</a>).<p>Their rage proves the apostles&#8217; message struck its intended target, exposing sin and calling for repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They resolved to put the apostles to death</b><p>The council&#8217;s decision shows how quickly sinful anger seeks violent solutions.<p>&#8226; This is the same body that &#8220;handed Jesus over to be killed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). Their consistency lies not in justice but in protecting power and reputation.<p>&#8226; Satanic opposition regularly moves from threats to lethal intent: Herod&#8217;s execution of James and arrest of Peter (<a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1-3</a>), Saul&#8217;s early campaign against believers (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>), and the plot against Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s sovereign hand intervenes. In the next verses He raises an unexpected voice&#8212;Gamaliel&#8212;to restrain the council, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where rulers rage but the Lord still reigns.<p>&#8226; The episode assures believers that no human scheme can silence the gospel until God determines (<a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38-39</a>). Obedience may invite danger, but it never outpaces divine protection (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-33.htm">Acts 5:33</a> records the immediate, visceral backlash of religious leaders when confronted with the truth of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and their culpability. Hearing the apostles&#8217; bold testimony provokes enraged hearts, and rage swiftly plots murder. The verse illustrates the predictable clash between gospel light and human darkness, yet also sets the stage for God&#8217;s preserving intervention. Faithful proclamation may enrage the world, but it will never overturn God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">They were</span> <span class= "bld">cut to the heart.</span>--The strict meaning of the verb describes the action of a saw, as in <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>.
