This incident occurred after Paul and his companions were shipwrecked on the island. The term "creature" refers to a venomous snake, which was common in the Mediterranean region. The fact that the snake was hanging from Paul's hand indicates a direct and potentially lethal bite, which would have been expected to cause immediate harm or death. This moment sets the stage for a miraculous demonstration of God's protection over Paul.<p><b>they said to one another, &#8220;Surely this man is a murderer.</b><br>The islanders' reaction reflects a common ancient belief in divine retribution, where misfortune was seen as punishment for wrongdoing. The assumption that Paul was a murderer suggests that they believed the snake bite was a form of divine justice. This belief aligns with the concept of "an eye for an eye" found in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>), where justice is meted out in a manner directly related to the crime.<p><b>Although he was saved from the sea,</b><br>The islanders acknowledged that Paul had survived the shipwreck, which they likely viewed as an act of divine intervention or favor. Surviving such a perilous event would have been seen as a sign of divine protection, yet the subsequent snake bite led them to question the nature of that protection. This reflects the tension between human understanding of justice and divine providence.<p><b>Justice has not allowed him to live.&#8221;</b><br>The reference to "Justice" personifies the concept of divine retribution, possibly alluding to the Greek goddess Dike, who was associated with moral order and fair judgment. The islanders believed that despite surviving the shipwreck, Paul was still subject to divine punishment for his presumed crime. This reflects a worldview where fate and divine justice are intertwined, and where human actions are believed to inevitably lead to corresponding consequences. This moment foreshadows the revelation of God's true power and mercy, as Paul remains unharmed, demonstrating the supremacy of God's will over human assumptions of justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is shipwrecked on the island of Malta.

Their reaction is immediate and visceral&#8212;snakes kill. Scripture consistently records real, physical dangers from serpents (<a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>), yet also God&#8217;s power to overrule them: &#8220;they will pick up snakes with their hands&#8230; it will not harm them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>). Luke writes this detail as simple fact, underscoring the literal danger and the literal protection that follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said to one another</b><p>Conversation rises among the witnesses. Much like the disciples wondered about the blind man, &#8220;Who sinned&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>), these islanders share their theological opinions aloud. Human hearts tend to interpret tragedy in community; we talk, compare notes, and draw conclusions&#8212;often without waiting for God&#8217;s side of the story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Surely this man is a murderer.&#8221;</b><p>Their logic is straightforward: bad things happen to bad people. Job&#8217;s friends used the same calculus (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7</a>) and were later corrected by God. Here, the locals assume Paul must have taken a life, echoing the principle &#8220;Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man his blood will be shed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The islanders&#8217; moral instinct is right&#8212;sin deserves judgment&#8212;but their specific verdict on Paul is wrong.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Although he was saved from the sea,&#8221;</b><p>They note the irony: Paul survived a shipwreck (<a href="/bsb/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>) yet now seems doomed. Life often feels that way&#8212;relief followed by fresh peril. Paul himself knew this pattern: &#8220;three times I was shipwrecked&#8230; a night and a day in the open sea&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). <a href="/psalms/107-29.htm">Psalm 107:29</a> reminds us that the God who stills storms is just as present on solid ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Justice has not allowed him to live.&#8221;</b><p>The islanders personify Justice as an unstoppable force. Scripture affirms a personal Judge behind all justice: &#8220;The Lord will judge His people&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a>). Their instinct is half-right&#8212;no one finally escapes divine scrutiny. Yet <a href="/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a> counters their despairing fatalism: &#8220;True righteousness leads to life,&#8221; and in the very next verses of Acts, Paul will live, proving God&#8217;s righteousness rather than retribution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/28-4.htm">Acts 28:4</a> records a real event that exposes a common human reflex: we equate suffering with guilt. The Maltese assume Paul&#8217;s snakebite means he must be a murderer, but God is about to overturn their verdict and magnify His protective power. The passage invites us to trust the literal narrative and to let God, not circumstances, define truth and justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The venomous beast.</span>--The adjective, as the italics show, is not in the Greek, and can scarcely be said to be necessary.<p><span class= "bld">No doubt this man is a murderer.</span>--They knew, we may believe, that St. Paul was a prisoner. It is hardly conceivable, indeed, that he could have come on shore bound by two chains, or even one, to his keeper, but, looking to the jealous care which the soldiers had shown in the custody of the prisoners (<a href="/acts/27-42.htm" title="And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.">Acts 27:42</a>), it would be natural that they should resume their vigilance over him as soon as they were all safe on shore. And so the natives of Melita, seeing what they did, and ignorant of the prisoner's crime, and with their rough notions of the divine government of the world, rushed to the conclusion that they were looking on an example of God's vengeance against murder.

In Greek mythology <span class="accented">Dice</span> (Justitia) was the daughter and assessor of Zeus, and the avenger of crime. In her train was Poena, of whom Horace says," Rare antecedeutem scelcstum Deseruit pede Poena claude" ('Od.,' 3:2, 32). "The idea of <span class="accented">Dice</span> as justice personified is most perfectly developed in the dramas of Sophocles and Euripides" (article "Dice," in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Biog. and Mythol.'). It does not appear whether the islanders had learned the name and office <span class="accented">of Dice</span> from the Greeks in Sicily, or whether they had any native divinity whose name St. Luke translates into that of <span class="accented">Dice.</span> The gods whose names are found in ancient Maltese inscriptions are <span class="accented">Melkarth</span>, another name of Hercules, the tutelar god of Tyre; <span class="accented">Osiris</span>, and <span class="accented">Baal.</span> Other Phoenician divinities are named in the Carthaginian inscriptions (see Gesenius, 'Monument. Phoenic.'). <span class="accented">Had not suffered</span>. They assume that death will certainly follow from the bite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
