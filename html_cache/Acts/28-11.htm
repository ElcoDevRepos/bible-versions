The three-month period likely corresponds to the winter months when sea travel was dangerous, reflecting the common practice of ancient mariners to avoid sailing during this time due to adverse weather conditions.<p><b>we set sail</b><br>The decision to set sail marks the continuation of Paul's journey to Rome, where he was to stand trial. This journey is significant as it fulfills God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). The act of setting sail also demonstrates the resilience and determination of Paul and his companions to complete their mission despite previous hardships.<p><b>in an Alexandrian ship</b><br>Alexandrian ships were large grain ships that transported wheat from Egypt to Rome, a crucial part of the Roman economy. These ships were known for their size and sturdiness, making them suitable for long voyages. The mention of an Alexandrian ship highlights the providence of God in providing a reliable means of transportation for Paul and his companions.<p><b>that had wintered in the island</b><br>The ship had stayed in Malta during the winter months, which was a common practice to avoid the dangerous Mediterranean storms. This detail underscores the strategic location of Malta as a safe harbor and the practical considerations of ancient maritime travel.<p><b>It had the Twin Brothers as a figurehead</b><br>The Twin Brothers, Castor and Pollux, were figures from Roman and Greek mythology, considered protectors of sailors. Their presence as a figurehead on the ship reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of the time, where such symbols were thought to bring good fortune and safety. This detail contrasts with Paul's reliance on the one true God for protection and guidance, highlighting the difference between pagan practices and Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his journey to Rome to stand trial.

Paul&#8217;s departure fulfills that promise step by step.<p>- Earlier, Paul had declared his desire: &#8220;After I have been there, I must also see Rome&#8221; (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>). Every new launch reinforces the certainty of God&#8217;s plan despite storms, shipwrecks, and delays.<p>- Bullet reminders:<p>&#8226; The mission moves forward when God says &#8220;go.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Delays are not denials.<p>&#8226; Obedience involves both waiting and moving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in an Alexandrian ship</b><p>- Alexandria supplied much of Rome&#8217;s grain, so its ships were large, sturdy cargo vessels&#8212;ideal for carrying passengers as well (<a href="/acts/27-6.htm">Acts 27:6</a>).<p>- God provided exactly the right transport at the right moment, underscoring His provision (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: the Lord often supplies common, everyday means (a commercial ship) to advance His uncommon purposes (the spread of the gospel).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that had wintered in the island</b><p>- The ship&#8217;s captain had wisely sought safe harbor rather than risk winter seas, paralleling the earlier intention of Paul&#8217;s wrecked vessel to find &#8220;a harbor in Crete to winter in&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>).<p>- Navigation facts verify Luke&#8217;s historical precision, strengthening confidence that Scripture records real events (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- Spiritually, the pause reminds us:<p>&#8226; Seasons of enforced rest can protect and prepare us.<p>&#8226; God synchronizes circumstances&#8212;Paul, crew, and ship all ready at the same moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It had the Twin Brothers as a figurehead</b><p>- &#8220;The Twin Brothers&#8221; refers to Castor and Pollux, considered patron deities of sailors. Luke notes the detail without approving the idolatry.<p>- Paul willingly rides aboard a vessel bearing pagan symbols, reflecting his freedom in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>) while remaining uncompromised in worship (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>- Similar scenario: at Lystra, people tried to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods, but the apostles urged, &#8220;Turn from these worthless things to the living God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>).<p>- Key lessons:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servants move through a pagan world without adopting its idols.<p>&#8226; The gospel is not hindered by surrounding superstition; instead, God&#8217;s supremacy is displayed when He carries His people safely despite it (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a> shows God&#8217;s faithful, detailed orchestration: after three months of fruitful ministry on Malta, Paul boards a grain ship&#8212;complete with pagan figurehead&#8212;perfectly positioned from wintering on the island. The verse confirms historical accuracy, underscores divine timing, and illustrates how the Lord uses ordinary means amid an idolatrous culture to advance His unstoppable purpose of getting the gospel to Rome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">After three months.</span>--The date may be approximately fixed. The Fast, falling on the 10th of Tisri, which has been calculated as falling in that year on September 24th, was passed, we are not told how long, when the ship left the Fair Havens (<a href="/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>). Then came the "fourteen days" of <a href="/acts/27-27.htm" title="But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;">Acts 27:27</a>, bringing us to the end of October or beginning of November. Three months from this carries us to the beginning of February. This was earlier than that usually fixed for the general navigation of the Mediterranean (see Note on <a href="/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>), but the officers and the crew of the Alexandrian ship were naturally anxious to take the earliest opportunity for pressing on to their destination. The fact that the latter had wintered in the island is obviously in favour of the identification of Melita with Malta, which lay on the usual line of the voyage from Alexandria to Italy, while Meleda was altogether out of the way.<p><span class= "bld">Whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Dioscuri, </span>the two sons of Zeus and Leda, who were regarded as the guardian deities of sailors. So Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 3, 2) speaks of the <span class= "ital">"fratres Helen?, lucida sidera</span>" ("brothers of Helen, beaming stars"), and (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 12, 25) of the "<span class= "ital">puerosque Ledce</span>" ("the children of Leda"), whose bright star shines propitiously on sailors. In Greek mythology, Zeus had rewarded their brotherly devotion by placing them among the stars as the <span class= "ital">Gemini, </span>which were connected with the month of May in the signs of the Zodiac, and Poseidon (= Neptune) had given them power over the winds and waves that they might assist the shipwrecked. So in the <span class= "ital">Helena</span> of Euripides they appear, in 1550?60, as promising a fair wind and a safe voyage. The figure-heads of the Greek and Roman ships were commonly placed both at the prow and the stern.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Set sail</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">island</span> for <span class="accented">isle</span>, A.V.; The <span class="accented">Twin Brothers</span> for <span class="accented">Castor and Pollux</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">After three months</span>. At the very earliest period when the sailing season began after the winter. It would be, perhaps, about the middle of February, or, as Alford thinks, about March 10.

Some ship, better fated than that one (<a href="/acts/27-6.htm">Acts 27:6</a>) which was wrecked in St. Paul's Bay, which had weathered or avoided the gale, and probably got into the harbor of Valetta in good time. One would have thought that this ship wintering at Malta on its way from Alexandria to Italy, via Sicily, would be of itself a sufficient proof that Melita was Malta. <span class="cmt_word">Which had wintered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Whose sign was The Twin Brothers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Latin the constellation <span class="accented">Gemini</span>). The twin sons of Jupiter and Leda, Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helena ("fratres Helenis, lucida sidera," Horace, 'Od.,' 1:3, 2), were called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Dioscuri, the</span> sons of Jove. It was their special office to assist sailors in danger of shipwreck. Hence Horace, in the ode just quoted, prays that Castor and Pollux, in conjunction with other deities, would carry the ship in which Virgil sailed safe to Attica. And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons. It was, therefore, very natural to have the Dioscuri for the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the sign of the ship.

(Alford), which was called the <span class="accented">tutela.</span> These were sometimes the same, and perhaps were so in this instance. Ovid tells us that Minerva was the <span class="accented">tutela</span> of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like.
