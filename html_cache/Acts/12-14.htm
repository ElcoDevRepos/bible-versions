This reflects the intimate nature of the early church, where members knew each other well. Peter's voice would have been distinctive, possibly due to his Galilean accent, which was noted during his denial of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>). This recognition also highlights the miraculous nature of Peter's escape from prison, as he was expected to be securely held by Herod's guards.<p><b>she was so overjoyed</b><br>Rhoda's reaction of joy underscores the emotional intensity and faith of the early believers. Her joy is reminiscent of the joy experienced by the disciples when they saw the risen Christ (<a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a>). This joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that their sorrow would turn to joy (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>).<p><b>that she forgot to open the gate</b><br>Her forgetfulness in opening the gate illustrates the human tendency to be overwhelmed by emotion, even in moments of divine intervention. This detail adds authenticity to the narrative, showing the genuine human reactions within the biblical account. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of practical action in conjunction with spiritual experiences.<p><b>but ran inside and announced</b><br>Rhoda's action of running inside to announce Peter's presence demonstrates the urgency and excitement of sharing good news. This mirrors the actions of the women who ran to tell the disciples about the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28-8.htm">Matthew 28:8</a>). It emphasizes the role of women in the early church as bearers of important news and participants in the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>&#8220;Peter is standing at the gate!&#8221;</b><br>Her announcement is a declaration of the miraculous, as Peter's presence at the gate was unexpected due to his imprisonment. This statement is a testament to God's power to deliver and protect His servants, fulfilling the promise of divine intervention (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>). It also foreshadows the continued spread of the Gospel despite opposition, as Peter's release allowed him to continue his ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who was miraculously freed from prison by an angel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rhoda.htm">Rhoda</a></b><br>A servant girl who recognized Peter's voice at the gate but was so overjoyed that she forgot to open it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_mary.htm">The House of Mary</a></b><br>The mother of John Mark, where many believers were gathered in prayer for Peter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, a central location for early Christian activity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who facilitated Peter's escape from prison.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>The church's prayers were instrumental in Peter's miraculous release.

Just as &#8220;the sheep hear His voice&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a>), believers grow familiar with the distinct voices of those who belong to the household of faith.<p>&#8226; Earlier the church had been &#8220;earnestly praying to God for him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>). God answers in real-time, and the very first evidence Rhoda receives is auditory&#8212;Peter&#8217;s unmistakable voice set against the night.<p>&#8226; Recognition here confirms a literal, bodily deliverance, paralleling earlier rescues such as <a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a> when the angel released the apostles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she was so overjoyed</b><p>&#8226; Luke singles out joy as Rhoda&#8217;s immediate, overwhelming reaction. When God intervenes, joy erupts (<a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1-3</a>; <a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Her joy is proof that the believers&#8217; prayers were not empty rituals; they expected God to act, but the swiftness and grandeur of His answer surpassed their imagination (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that she forgot to open the gate</b><p>&#8226; Genuine excitement can override routine duties. Rhoda&#8217;s lapse is not negligence but the spontaneous overflow of a heart stunned by God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Scripture often records moments when joy momentarily disrupts normal order&#8212;David dancing before the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-16</a>) or the healed beggar leaping in the temple (<a href="/acts/3-8.htm">Acts 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but ran inside</b><p>&#8226; Rhoda&#8217;s impulse is to share good news. Like the Samaritan woman who &#8220;left her water jar&#8221; to tell her town (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28-29</a>), she leaves Peter at the gate to testify to the gathering inside.<p>&#8226; The verb tense suggests urgency; she cannot keep silent (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>). Evangelism frequently begins with simply relaying what we have witnessed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and announced, &#8220;Peter is standing at the gate!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Her announcement is short, clear, and centered on God&#8217;s answer: Peter, once chained in prison, now stands free.<p>&#8226; The church&#8217;s incredulous response that follows (v.15) mirrors the disciples doubting the women&#8217;s resurrection report (<a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>). God&#8217;s deliverance sometimes arrives so dramatically that even praying saints struggle to believe it.<p>&#8226; Yet Rhoda&#8217;s testimony is accurate. Like the watchmen in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, she brings &#8220;good news of great joy&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/12-14.htm">Acts 12:14</a> captures the spontaneous, joy-filled response of a believer who witnesses God&#8217;s immediate answer to prayer. Rhoda&#8217;s recognition of Peter&#8217;s voice, her overwhelming delight, her forgotten duty, her dash to inform the others, and her brief proclamation together illustrate how God&#8217;s miraculous interventions stir uncontainable joy and instinctive testimony. The verse reminds us that God hears, God acts, and the proper human response is exuberant proclamation of His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">She opened not the gate for gladness.</span>--The slave, it would seem, had shared the anxiety and borne her part in the prayers of the Church; and the eager desire to tell the good news that their prayers had been answered overpowers her presence of mind.
