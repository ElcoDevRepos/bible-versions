The "words and names" likely refer to theological debates about Jesus as the Messiah and the interpretation of Jewish law. This reflects the early Christian struggle to define its identity within Judaism. The mention of "your own law" indicates Gallio's recognition of the issue as an internal religious matter, not a civil one. This distinction is crucial in understanding the Roman Empire's approach to religious disputes, often allowing local customs and laws to govern such issues unless they threatened public order.<p><b>settle it yourselves</b><br>Gallio's directive for the Jews to resolve the matter independently underscores the Roman policy of non-interference in religious affairs unless they disrupted the peace. This approach allowed for a degree of religious autonomy within the empire. The phrase also reflects the broader theme in Acts of the separation between civil authority and religious matters, a recurring issue for the early church. This autonomy is significant for the spread of Christianity, as it allowed the early church to grow without immediate Roman suppression.<p><b>I refuse to be a judge of such things.&#8221;</b><br>Gallio's refusal to adjudicate the matter illustrates the Roman officials' reluctance to involve themselves in what they perceived as internal religious disputes. This decision is pivotal, as it sets a precedent for the treatment of Christianity under Roman law, distinguishing it from political insurrection. Gallio's stance is consistent with Roman legal principles, which often avoided entanglement in theological debates. This moment in Acts is crucial for understanding the legal environment in which early Christianity spread, highlighting the protection and challenges faced by the nascent church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul was a missionary and apostle who spread the Gospel throughout the Roman Empire.

To a Roman official, these are mere semantics; to believers, they are eternal truths (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>). God uses even Gallio&#8217;s indifference to safeguard Paul and keep the mission moving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>settle it yourselves</b><p>Gallio pushes responsibility back onto the synagogue leaders.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a> he echoes Pilate&#8217;s directive: &#8220;Take Him yourselves and judge Him by your own law.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By telling them to handle the matter internally, Gallio unintentionally protects the church&#8217;s freedom to preach (<a href="/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underscores the biblical principle that civil authorities should not police doctrinal disputes; such matters belong within the household of faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1-5</a> for internal judgment among believers).<p>This moment models how God can use secular powers&#8212;even indifferent ones&#8212;to preserve His people&#8217;s liberty to proclaim the gospel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I refuse to be a judge of such things</b><p>Gallio draws a firm line: Roman courts address crimes, not creeds.<p>&#8226; Later, Festus echoes the same stance when Jewish leaders press charges against Paul: the dispute is &#8220;about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive&#8221; (<a href="/acts/25-18.htm">Acts 25:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Such refusals fulfill Jesus&#8217; promise of protection for His witnesses (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18-20</a>). Rome&#8217;s neutrality here gives Paul an 18-month window in Corinth to teach boldly (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The decision also establishes legal precedent: Christianity, still viewed as a branch of Judaism, remains a permitted religion under Roman law at this stage (<a href="/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>).<p>Gallio unknowingly advances God&#8217;s sovereign plan, proving that &#8220;the king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He will&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-15.htm">Acts 18:15</a> records a pagan governor brushing off a theological quarrel&#8212;but behind his dismissal, God is at work. Gallio&#8217;s verdict keeps the gospel free from legal suppression, affirms the proper boundary between state and church, and highlights how even secular authorities can serve God&#8217;s redemptive purposes. Paul stays in Corinth, the church grows, and the message of Christ advances&#8212;all because one magistrate refused &#8220;to be a judge of such things.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law.</span>--The second noun is in the singular number in the Greek. St. Paul was known as a speaker, one who preached the <span class= "ital">word</span> of God, and with that, as distinct from acts, Gallio had nothing to do.
