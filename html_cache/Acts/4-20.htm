The context is Peter and John before the Sanhedrin, where they are commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus. Their response highlights the divine compulsion to witness, echoing the prophetic tradition where God's messengers cannot remain silent (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>). This also aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to spread His teachings to all nations.<p><b>about what we have seen</b><br>The apostles were eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This firsthand experience is crucial, as it provides the foundation for their testimony. The emphasis on "seen" underscores the tangible reality of Jesus' resurrection, countering any claims that it was merely a spiritual or metaphorical event. This aligns with 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where the apostle John emphasizes the physical reality of Jesus, whom they have "seen with our eyes."<p><b>and heard.&#8221;</b><br>The apostles not only witnessed Jesus' actions but also heard His teachings. This dual aspect of seeing and hearing is significant in Jewish tradition, where a matter is established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The apostles' testimony is thus both visual and auditory, providing a comprehensive witness to the truth of the gospel. This phrase also connects to <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the message of Christ, emphasizing the importance of proclaiming the gospel so others may hear

John&#8217;s declaration to the immediate context&#8212;an answer to the Sanhedrin&#8217;s command to be silent (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals a reasoned, God&#8211;honoring defense: obedience to Christ overrides any human prohibition (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This conjunction reminds us that Christian boldness is not reckless defiance but a thoughtful response to God&#8217;s higher authority (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16&#8211;18</a> shows the same pattern).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We cannot stop</b><p>&#8226; The apostles describe an inner impossibility, not merely a decision.<p>&#8211; Jeremiah felt the same holy compulsion: &#8220;His message becomes a fire burning in my heart&#8230; I cannot prevail&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul echoed it: &#8220;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>); &#8220;Christ&#8217;s love compels us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s power (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>) makes silence unthinkable; divine urgency overrides fear, fatigue, or opposition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Speaking</b><p>&#8226; Verbal witness is emphasized; the gospel must be spoken, not merely displayed by lifestyle.<p>&#8211; &#8220;How can they hear without someone to preach?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul sought prayer &#8220;that words may be given me&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Bold speech in Acts consistently accompanies Spirit&#8211;filled believers (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>), showing that proclamation is God&#8217;s chosen conduit for salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About what we have seen and heard</b><p>&#8226; The

proclaim to you what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; They speak of:<p>&#8211; Jesus&#8217; sinless life, atoning death, and bodily

public proclamation; like <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, they had &#8220;seen His glory,&#8221; so silence would betray reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226;
