His belief is significant because it shows the power of the Gospel to reach even those deeply entrenched in occult practices. This phrase highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel message, which can transform anyone, regardless of their past. Simon's belief also serves as a reminder of the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>), where different types of soil represent different responses to the Gospel.<p><b>and was baptized.</b><br>Baptism in the early church was a public declaration of faith and a symbol of repentance and new life in Christ (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). Simon's baptism indicates his initial acceptance into the Christian community. This act aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize believers. However, Simon's later actions suggest that his understanding of faith and baptism might have been superficial, serving as a cautionary tale about the importance of genuine conversion.<p><b>He followed Philip closely</b><br>Philip, one of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, was instrumental in spreading the Gospel to Samaria. Simon's close following of Philip suggests a desire to learn more about the Christian faith and the source of Philip's power. This mirrors the discipleship model seen throughout the New Testament, where new believers learn from more mature Christians (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>). However, Simon's motives may have been mixed, as he was more interested in the miraculous aspects of Philip's ministry.<p><b>and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.</b><br>The signs and miracles performed by Philip were evidence of the Holy Spirit's power and served to authenticate the message of the Gospel (<a href="/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>). Simon's amazement at these miracles indicates his recognition of a power greater than his own sorcery. This reflects the biblical theme that true divine power surpasses all human or demonic forces (<a href="/exodus/7-10.htm">Exodus 7:10-12</a>). However, Simon's focus on the miraculous rather than the message itself foreshadows his later attempt to purchase the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18-19</a>), highlighting the danger of valuing signs over spiritual truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_sorcerer.htm">Simon the Sorcerer</a></b><br>A man known for practicing sorcery in Samaria, who amazed the people with his magic.

Scripture later reveals his heart was still captive to sin (<a href="/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21-23</a>), reminding us that outward agreement can fall short of true repentance (<a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel&#8217;s power, not Philip&#8217;s personality, broke through Simon&#8217;s former deception (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was baptized</b><p>&#8226; Baptism immediately followed a confession of faith in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>; 16:33). Simon received the same visible sign of identification with Christ as every new believer (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet water alone does not save; it portrays an inner reality that must be genuine (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). Simon&#8217;s later rebuke from Peter shows that a ritual without a changed heart leaves a person still &#8220;in the gall of bitterness&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-23.htm">Acts 8:23</a>).<p>&#8226; His story cautions us to examine ourselves (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) and to remember that baptism, though commanded, is no substitute for living faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He followed Philip closely</b><p>&#8226; Simon became Philip&#8217;s constant companion, eager to stay near the evangelist who had upended his former status (<a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Proximity to godly leaders can be helpful (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>), yet it cannot transfer righteousness. Judas followed Jesus for three years and remained unconverted (<a href="/john/6-70.htm">John 6:70-71</a>).<p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s attachment was driven more by fascination than surrender, demonstrating that discipleship involves more than physical nearness; it requires a heart submitted to Christ (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed</b><p>&#8226; As a magician, Simon understood counterfeit power; thus the authentic miracles God worked through Philip left him &#8220;astounded&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Miraculous signs validated the gospel message (<a href="/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>), but they were never meant to eclipse the call to repentance. When signs become the focus, people may seek power rather than the Savior (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s amazement did not translate into a transformed will. Peter&#8217;s later charge&#8212;&#8220;Your heart is not right before God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21</a>)&#8212;shows that wonder without worship is spiritually empty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-13.htm">Acts 8:13</a> describes a visible, dramatic response from a well-known sorcerer: he professed belief, received baptism, attached himself to the evangelist, and marveled at God&#8217;s power. The verse celebrates the gospel&#8217;s reach while also foreshadowing the danger of superficial faith. Simon&#8217;s example teaches that genuine conversion involves more than intellectual assent, public ceremony, admiration of leaders, or fascination with miracles. True belief yields a repentant, surrendered heart that treasures Christ above all else and bears lasting fruit (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Then Simon himself believed also.</span>--Endless questions have been raised as to the nature of such a faith, and the effect of such a baptism. It is probable enough that he was impressed by the signs that Philip wrought; that he felt himself in the presence of a Power above his own; that he accepted Philip's statements as to the death and resurrection of the Christ. It was such a faith as that of which St. James speaks (<a href="/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14</a>; <a href="/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>). If we are to use the definite language of theological science, it would be true to say that he had the <span class= "ital">fides informis, </span>faith not preceded by repentance and not perfected by love. And baptism, in such a case, the expressed or implied conditions being absent, brought with it no new birth to a higher life. He remained still "in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity" (<a href="/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>). But even for him it bore its witness of the readiness of God to forgive and to regenerate. The subsequent fulfilment of the conditions which were then absent would have quickened the potential into an actual grace, and no second baptism would have been needed to supplement the shortcomings of the first. Peter calls on him (<a href="/acts/8-22.htm" title="Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.">Acts 8:22</a>) to repent and pray for forgiveness. He does not tell him that he must be baptised again.<p><span class= "bld">And wondered.</span>--The verb is the same as that rendered "bewitched" in <a href="/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="/acts/8-11.htm" title="And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.">Acts 8:11</a>. The tables were turned. The magician yielded to a spell mightier than his own, and was, in his turn, as one beside himself with amazement. The difference between Simon and the believing Samaritans is, in this matter, suggestive. His faith rested on outward miracles. With them the miracles did but serve to confirm a faith which rested on the "prophetic word" as spoken by the Son of Man (<a href="/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">also himself believed</span> for <span class="accented">himself believed also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">being baptized</span> for <span class="accented">when he was baptized</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed</span> for <span class="accented">wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span> Contained with (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; 3:46; 6:4; 10.7.

Elsewhere in the New Testament it occurs only in <a href="/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9</a>. But it is found in Hist. cf. Sus. 6. Amazed (see note on ver. 9). In Simon we have the first example of one who, having been baptized into Jesus Christ, lived to disgrace and corrupt the faith which he professed. He was an instance of the tares sown among the wheat, and of the seed which sprang up quickly being as quickly destroyed. He is an instance also of the truth of our Lord's raying, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
