In Jewish culture, the day begins at sunrise, and this early start reflects their dedication to spreading the Gospel. It also symbolizes the light of Christ breaking into the darkness, a theme consistent with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>the apostles entered the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were a central place for teaching and worship in Jerusalem. The apostles' choice to teach here highlights their boldness and the public nature of their ministry. The temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, making it a strategic location for reaching a large audience. This act also fulfills Jesus' command to be His witnesses in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>as they had been told</b><br>This phrase indicates obedience to divine instruction. Earlier in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>, an angel of the Lord had freed the apostles from prison and instructed them to "Go, stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life" (<a href="/acts/5-20.htm">Acts 5:20</a>). Their compliance demonstrates their faith and trust in God's plan.<p><b>and began to teach the people</b><br>Teaching was a primary method of spreading the Gospel in the early church. The apostles' teaching would have included the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). This teaching was not just informational but transformational, calling people to repentance and faith in Christ.<p><b>When the high priest and his associates arrived</b><br>The high priest and his associates represent the religious authority of the time. Their arrival signifies the tension between the new Christian movement and the established Jewish leadership. The high priest, likely Caiaphas at this time, was a key figure in the opposition to Jesus and His followers.<p><b>they convened the Sanhedrin</b><br>The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish council and court, consisting of 71 members, including the high priest, elders, and scribes. It held significant religious and political power. The convening of the Sanhedrin indicates the seriousness with which the Jewish leaders viewed the apostles' activities.<p><b>the full assembly of the elders of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the gathering, involving all the influential leaders of the Jewish community. It underscores the gravity of the situation and the perceived threat the apostles posed to the religious status quo.<p><b>and sent to the jail for the apostles</b><br>The apostles had been imprisoned for preaching about Jesus, reflecting the growing persecution of the early church. The Sanhedrin's decision to send for them highlights the legal and religious challenges the apostles faced. This act sets the stage for the miraculous events that follow, demonstrating God's power and protection over His messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The early followers of Jesus Christ, specifically those who were directly commissioned by Him to spread the Gospel.
