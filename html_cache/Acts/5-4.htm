In the early church, believers voluntarily shared their possessions (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-37</a>), but there was no compulsion to do so. The land Ananias sold was his own, emphasizing the freedom and responsibility of ownership. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with resources by God and are accountable for their use (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><b>And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?</b><br>Even after the sale, Ananias had the freedom to decide what to do with the proceeds. This underscores the voluntary nature of giving in the early church. The issue was not the amount given but the deceit involved. This connects to the broader biblical theme of integrity and honesty in dealings (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>How could you conceive such a deed in your heart?</b><br>This question addresses the internal motivation and the heart's role in sin. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of will and emotion (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). Ananias's sin was premeditated, showing a deliberate choice to deceive. This reflects the biblical teaching that sin originates in the heart and mind before manifesting in actions (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><b>You have not lied to men, but to God!</b><br>This statement emphasizes the gravity of Ananias's sin. While the lie was outwardly to the apostles, it was ultimately against God, highlighting the divine presence and authority within the church. This connects to the biblical understanding that God is omniscient and sees the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). It also underscores the Holy Spirit's role in the church, equating lying to the Spirit with lying to God, affirming the deity of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, <a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias_and_sapphira.htm">Ananias and Sapphira</a></b><br>A married couple in the early church who sold a piece of property but deceitfully withheld part of the proceeds while claiming to donate the entire amount to the apostles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles and a leader in the early church, who confronts Ananias about his deceit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church_in_jerusalem.htm">The Early Church in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The community of believers who shared their possessions and lived in unity, as described in the preceding chapters of Acts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, to whom Ananias and Sapphira lied, as emphasized by Peter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_deception.htm">The Event of Deception</a></b><br>The act of Ananias and Sapphira lying about the proceeds from the sale of their property, which led to their deaths as a divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a social or moral failing but an offense against God.

Ananias&#8217;s sin was not withholding the land, but pretending to give all while secretly keeping part.<p>The verse calls us to view every possession as a stewardship issue: God lets us hold it, yet He wants honesty and integrity when we decide how to use it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?</b><p>Ananias had complete freedom over the proceeds.

Publicly, Ananias acted as though he gave 100%; privately, he kept a portion.<p>&#8211; God values authenticity more than the amount placed in the offering.<p>When we steward resources today, He still asks for transparency. Hidden motives erode trust within the body and grieve the Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How could you conceive such a deed in your heart?</b><p>The real battlefield is the heart.

Ananias had not been bound by any rule of the Church to such a gift. At every stage he was free to act as he thought best; and had he brought part as part, or even brought nothing, he would have been free from any special blame.
