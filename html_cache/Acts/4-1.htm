This follows the healing of the lame man at the temple gate, which drew significant attention. Their speaking is a continuation of their witness to the resurrection of Jesus, a central theme in the early chapters of Acts. This public proclamation is a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses in Jerusalem. The setting is likely the temple courts, a common place for teaching and discussion.<p><b>the priests</b><br>The priests were influential religious leaders responsible for temple rituals and maintaining the spiritual life of Israel. They were part of the Levitical order, descendants of Aaron, and held significant authority in Jewish society. Their involvement here indicates the perceived threat Peter and John posed to the established religious order by preaching Jesus' resurrection, which challenged the Sadducees' beliefs and the temple's authority.<p><b>and the captain of the temple guard</b><br>The captain of the temple guard was a high-ranking official responsible for maintaining order in the temple precincts. This position was second only to the high priest in terms of authority within the temple hierarchy. The presence of the captain underscores the seriousness with which the temple authorities viewed the apostles' activities. The temple guard was tasked with preventing disturbances and ensuring that temple worship proceeded without interruption.<p><b>and the Sadducees</b><br>The Sadducees were a sect of Judaism known for their aristocratic status and control of the temple. They were distinct from the Pharisees in their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits, as noted in <a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>. Their opposition to Peter and John is rooted in theological differences, as the apostles' message of Jesus' resurrection directly contradicted Sadducean doctrine. The Sadducees' involvement highlights the political and religious tensions of the time, as they sought to preserve their power and influence.<p><b>came up to them</b><br>The approach of these authorities signifies an impending confrontation. The Sadducees, priests, and temple guard were likely motivated by a desire to suppress what they saw as a dangerous and heretical movement. This encounter is part of a broader pattern of opposition faced by the early church, as seen throughout Acts. It foreshadows the persecution that the apostles and early Christians would endure for their faith, fulfilling Jesus' warnings about the cost of discipleship (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Two of Jesus' apostles who were actively preaching the resurrection of Jesus Christ and performing miracles in His name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for temple rituals and maintaining religious order among the Jewish people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_captain_of_the_temple_guard.htm">The Captain of the Temple Guard</a></b><br>The official responsible for maintaining order in the temple precincts, second in authority only to the high priest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sadducees.htm">The Sadducees</a></b><br>A sect of Judaism known for their denial of the resurrection and the existence of spirits, often in conflict with the Pharisees and early Christians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jewish people in Jerusalem, where significant religious and social activities took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_proclaiming_the_gospel.htm">Boldness in Proclaiming the Gospel</a></b><br>Peter and John exemplify courage in the face of opposition.

A few weeks or months had gone by, and they were congratulating themselves on having followed the advice of Caiaphas (<a href="/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>). They knew that the body of Jesus had disappeared from the sepulchre, and they industriously circulated the report that the disciples had stolen it (<a href="/context/matthew/28-13.htm" title="Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.">Matthew 28:13-15</a>). They must have heard something of the Day of Pentecost--though there is no evidence of their having been present as spectators or listeners--and of the growth of the new society. Now the two chief members of the company of those disciples were teaching publicly in the very portico of the Temple. What were they to do? The "captain of the Temple" (see Note on <a href="/luke/22-4.htm" title="And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.">Luke 22:4</a>) was the head of the band of Levite sentinels whose function it was to keep guard over the sacred precincts. He, as an inspector, made his round by night, visited all the gates, and roused the slumberers. His presence implied that the quiet order of the Temple was supposed to be endangered. In <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/3-4.htm" title="But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.">2 Maccabees 3:4</a>, however, we have a "captain," or "governor of the Temple" of the tribe of Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">The Sadducees.</span>--The higher members of the priesthood, Annas and Caiaphas, were themselves of this sect (<a href="/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>). They had already been foremost in urging the condemnation of Christ in the meetings of the Sanhedrin. The shame of having been put to silence by Him (<a href="/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34</a>) added vindictiveness to the counsels of a calculating policy. Now they found His disciples preaching the truth which they denied, and proclaiming it as attested by the resurrection of Jesus. Throughout the Acts the Sadducees are foremost as persecutors. The Pharisees temporise, like Gamaliel, or profess themselves believers. (Comp. <a href="/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;">Acts 5:34</a>; <a href="/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="/acts/23-7.htm" title="And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.">Acts 23:7</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The captain of the temple.</span> Only here and <a href="/acts/5-24.htm">Acts 5:24</a>, and <a href="/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4, 52</a> in the plural some have thought that the commander of the Roman garrison of the castle of Antonia is here meant.

He also mentions the captain of the temple ('Bell. Jud.,' 6, 5:3) at the time of the destruction of the temple.
