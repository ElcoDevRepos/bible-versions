In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, Paul is addressing the crew and passengers aboard a ship caught in a violent storm. The term "preservation" underscores the immediate physical need for sustenance to endure the ongoing ordeal. Biblically, preservation often implies divine protection, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7</a>, where God is described as the preserver of life. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence and care for His people.<p><b>I urge you to eat something</b><br>Paul's urging to eat is practical advice in the midst of crisis. Historically, sailors in ancient times faced perilous conditions at sea, and maintaining physical strength was crucial for survival. This moment also reflects Paul's leadership and concern for others, reminiscent of Jesus' compassion in feeding the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>). Eating together can symbolize fellowship and unity, which is vital in times of distress.<p><b>because not a single hair of your head will be lost.</b><br>This phrase is a reassurance of safety and divine protection. It echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a>, where He assures His followers of God's meticulous care. The imagery of "not a single hair" emphasizes the completeness of God's protection, suggesting that even the smallest details of our lives are under His watchful care. This promise of preservation is a testament to God's faithfulness and echoes the covenantal assurances found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises to be with His people through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this verse.

Now he zeroes in on practical responsibility: &#8220;for your own preservation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise does not cancel human action; it motivates it. The same balance is seen when Nehemiah trusted God yet posted guards (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Preservation here is physical safety, showing that God cares about bodies as well as souls. Jesus likewise protected His disciples in the garden, saying, &#8220;Let these go&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Taking steps toward survival honors the Lord who authored life (<a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I urge you to eat something</b><p>Storm-tossed sailors had fasted fourteen days, drained of strength (<a href="/acts/27-33.htm">Acts 27:33</a>). Paul&#8217;s exhortation is compassionate and intensely practical.<p>&#8226; Eating restores energy needed to act on God&#8217;s deliverance, much like Elijah&#8217;s angel-provided meal empowered him for a forty-day journey (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; God often meets needs through ordinary means&#8212;food, rest, fellowship. Jesus instructed Jairus&#8217;s family to give the resurrected girl something to eat (<a href="/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a>).<p>&#8226; The invitation is inclusive; Paul breaks bread &#8220;in the presence of them all&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>), echoing how Christ fed multitudes (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>) and how fellowship meals knit believers together (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because not a single hair of your head will be lost</b><p>Paul anchors the call to eat in God&#8217;s unbreakable promise of total safety.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Not a single hair&#8221; recalls Jesus&#8217; assurances in <a href="/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> and <a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>&#8212;divine omniscience coupled with intimate care.<p>&#8226; The phrase is literal: every life on that ship will reach shore intact (<a href="/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>). God protects to the smallest detail.<p>&#8226; This certainty fuels courage. Knowing the end is secure enables wise action in the moment (<a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-34.htm">Acts 27:34</a> blends divine promise with human responsibility. God guarantees complete preservation&#8212;&#8220;not a single hair&#8221; will be lost&#8212;yet He calls the crew to strengthen themselves by eating. Trusting the Lord&#8217;s precise care frees us to take practical steps, confident that He is working through them to accomplish exactly what He has said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">This is for your health.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">safety, </span>or <span class= "ital">preservation.</span> The Greek word is not that commonly translated "health," and the translators seem to have used it in the wider sense which it had in older English. So, for example, in Wiclif's version, "the knowledge of salvation" in <a href="/luke/1-77.htm" title="To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,">Luke 1:77</a> appears as "the science of health." Wiclif has "health" here also, and is followed by all the chief English versions, except the Geneva, which has "safe-guard." What St. Paul means is that the preservation of his fellow-passengers depended on their keeping up their strength. The gracious assurance that followed was, as before, not independent of their co-operation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Beseech</span> for <span class="accented">pray</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">food</span> for <span class="accented">meat</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">safety</span> for <span class="accented">health</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a hair</span> for <span class="accented">an hair</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">perish</span> for <span class="accented">fall</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Take</span>; here in the R.T. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of the T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Your safety</span>; or, <span class="accented">health</span>; <span class="accented">i.</span>e. for the preservation of your lives in the impending struggle. <span class="cmt_word">Not a hair perish</span>; or, according to the T.R., <span class="accented">fall.</span> It is uncertain whether <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (R.T.) or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (T.R.) is the right reading.
