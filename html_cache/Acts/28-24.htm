In the context of <a href="/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, Paul is in Rome, under house arrest, yet he continues to preach the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles. The phrase "convinced by what he said" indicates that some listeners were persuaded by Paul's explanation of the Scriptures, particularly his testimony about Jesus as the Messiah. This reflects the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>) about the varied responses to God's message. The ability of Paul's words to convince some listeners underscores the power of the Holy Spirit in opening hearts to the truth of the Gospel (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>but others refused to believe</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the persistent unbelief that Paul often encountered, especially among the Jewish audience. Despite the evidence and reasoning presented, some chose to harden their hearts, reminiscent of the Israelites' historical pattern of resistance to God's messengers (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51-52</a>). This refusal to believe is not due to a lack of evidence but a willful rejection, as seen in other parts of Scripture where Jesus Himself faced disbelief (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-40</a>). The division in response also fulfills Jesus' words about the Gospel bringing division (<a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>). This persistent unbelief serves as a reminder of the spiritual battle and the necessity of prayer for the opening of hearts (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>A central figure in the New Testament, Paul is in Rome under house arrest, preaching the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The capital of the Roman Empire, where Paul is spreading the message of Jesus Christ to the Jewish community and others interested in his teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_audience.htm">Jewish Audience</a></b><br>The primary group Paul is addressing in this passage, consisting of Jewish leaders and individuals curious about the message of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_arrest.htm">House Arrest</a></b><br>Paul is under house arrest, which allows him to receive visitors and preach the Gospel, despite his confinement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/division_of_belief.htm">Division of Belief</a></b><br>The event described in this verse highlights the division among Paul's listeners, with some accepting his message and others rejecting it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_the_gospel_message.htm">The Nature of the Gospel Message</a></b><br>The Gospel inherently divides; it is a message that requires a response, and not all will accept it.

Each listener had the freedom&#8212;and the calling&#8212;to respond personally, just as Joshua once said, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>- God never leaves Himself without a witness. Even in hard-hearted settings, He draws some to repentance, fulfilling His promise that His word &#8220;will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were convinced</b><p>- The conviction described is not vague interest but settled assurance. Paul &#8220;fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>), presenting clear evidence from &#8220;the Law of Moses and the Prophets&#8221; (<a href="/acts/28-23.htm">Acts 28:23</a>).<p>- Faith comes through persuasion: &#8220;So faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>- Conviction here rests on fact, not feeling. Paul marshaled Scripture and eyewitness testimony&#8212;mirroring Jesus&#8217; post-resurrection method: &#8220;He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by what he said</b><p>- Paul&#8217;s words were saturated with Scripture: &#8220;explaining and declaring the kingdom of God and persuading them about Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/28-23.htm">Acts 28:23</a>).<p>- His message was Christ-centered, echoing his earlier declaration, &#8220;I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>).<p>- The Spirit partners with the spoken word: &#8220;Our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but others</b><p>- Mixed responses are normal. In Pisidian Antioch, &#8220;the Jews were filled with jealousy&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>), while Gentiles rejoiced. At the Areopagus, &#8220;some mocked, but others said, &#8216;We will hear you again&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>).<p>- The presence of unbelief does not signal failure; it confirms the divided reactions Jesus predicted: &#8220;I did not come to bring peace, but a sword&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>refused to believe</b><p>- The issue is moral, not intellectual. They &#8220;refused&#8221; (literally, were unpersuaded), echoing the pattern: &#8220;The Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God&#8217;s purpose for themselves&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>).<p>- Persistent unbelief hardens the heart: &#8220;Though He had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>).<p>- Such refusal fulfills prophecy Paul immediately cites: &#8220;Go to this people and say, &#8216;You will be ever hearing but never understanding&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26</a>, quoting <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). Yet even judgment underscores God&#8217;s justice, for He &#8220;desires all people to be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and judges only those who &#8220;took pleasure in unrighteousness&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/28-24.htm">Acts 28:24</a> captures the timeless divide the gospel creates. Paul&#8217;s clear, Scripture-filled proclamation convinced some, demonstrating God&#8217;s saving power. Others consciously shut the door of faith, revealing the danger of hardened hearts. The verse reminds us that every presentation of Jesus calls for a response&#8212;and that God remains faithful both to save those who believe and to judge the persistent unbeliever, vindicating the truth of His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And some believed the things which were spoken.</span>--Better, as expressing the fact that the verb is the passive form of that translated "persuade," in the previous verse, <span class= "ital">some were being persuaded of the things that were spoken.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Disbelieved</span> for <span class="accented">believed not</span>, A.V.
