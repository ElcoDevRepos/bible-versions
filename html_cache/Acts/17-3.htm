The fulfillment of prophecies relating to the Messiah in the person of Jesus is like the fitting of a key to the intricate wards of the lock, which proves that it is the right key. The preacher of the gospel should carefully study and expound to the people the word of prophecy, and then show its counterpart in the sufferings and glory of Christ. This did St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Opening</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); as our Lord had done (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), the hidden meaning of the prophecies, and then <span class="cmt_word">alleging</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), setting before them the propositions which had thus been established. The process is described in <a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a> as <span class="accented">interpreting</span> ("expounded," A.V.). In this verse the opening was showing from the prophets that the Messiah was to die and rise again; the <span class="accented">alleging</span> was that Jesus was that very Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">explaining</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(dianoig&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1272.htm">Strong's 1272: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open fully.
