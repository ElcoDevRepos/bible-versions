The "light" is often interpreted as the glory of God, similar to the Shekinah glory seen in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>). This light is a manifestation of divine presence, aligning with other biblical accounts where God's presence is accompanied by light (e.g., <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a> during the Transfiguration). The fact that the companions saw the light but did not understand the voice suggests a selective revelation, emphasizing Paul's unique calling and experience.<p><b>but they could not understand the voice</b><br>The inability of Paul's companions to understand the voice highlights the personal nature of God's call to Paul. This mirrors other biblical instances where God speaks directly to individuals, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) or Samuel in the temple (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4-10</a>). The Greek term used here can mean "to hear" or "to understand," suggesting that while they heard a sound, the message was not comprehensible to them. This selective hearing underscores the specific and personal nature of divine revelation.<p><b>of the One speaking to me</b><br>The "One" refers to Jesus Christ, who is identified as the speaker in <a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>. This encounter is pivotal in Paul's conversion and mission as an apostle to the Gentiles. It fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, where God promises to make His servant a light to the nations. The personal address from Jesus to Paul signifies a direct commissioning, similar to the calling of prophets in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8-9</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-5</a>).

This at first sight seems inconsistent with the statement in <a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, "hearing the voice." But the apparent inconsistency disappears when we observe that here St. Paul wished to impress upon his hearers that, though his companions had seen the light, they had not heard the words which were addressed to him by the Lord Jesus (see ver. 14); whereas St. Luke, in the narrative in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>, wished rather to insist upon the fact that though the men had seen the light and heard the sound of the voice, they had not seen Jesus. To see and hear the risen Christ was a privilege given to St. Paul alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/22-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">My companions</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
