Daybreak, or dawn, symbolizes new beginnings and revelation. In the context of <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, it marks the moment when the miraculous escape of Peter from prison is discovered. This time of day is also significant in other biblical narratives, such as the resurrection of Jesus, which was discovered at dawn (<a href="/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>).<p><b>there was no small commotion among the soldiers</b><br>The phrase "no small commotion" is a biblical way of indicating a significant disturbance or uproar. The soldiers were likely in a state of panic and confusion, as they were responsible for guarding Peter, who was a high-profile prisoner. In Roman culture, soldiers who failed in their duties could face severe punishment, including death, which adds to the gravity of the situation. This commotion underscores the miraculous nature of Peter's escape, as it was beyond human explanation.<p><b>as to what had become of Peter</b><br>Peter's disappearance was inexplicable to the soldiers, as he was heavily guarded. This event highlights the divine intervention that allowed Peter to escape, as described earlier in <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, where an angel of the Lord led him out of prison. The soldiers' bewilderment serves to emphasize the power of God in protecting and delivering His servants. This incident also parallels other biblical accounts of divine deliverance, such as Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6) and Paul and Silas in prison (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>). These stories collectively illustrate God's sovereignty and ability to rescue His people from seemingly impossible situations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who was imprisoned by Herod but miraculously freed by an angel of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king who had Peter arrested, intending to persecute him as he had done with James.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/soldiers.htm">Soldiers</a></b><br>The guards responsible for keeping Peter in prison, who were bewildered by his disappearance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, a central location for early Christian activity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>The divine messenger who facilitated Peter's escape from prison.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Circumstances</a></b><br>God's intervention in Peter's situation demonstrates His ultimate control over human affairs, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels.htm">The Role of Angels</a></b><br>Angels are active participants in God's plan, serving as protectors and deliverers for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Faith in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Believers can trust in God's ability to deliver them from trials, just as He did for Peter.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>The church was fervently praying for Peter (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>), highlighting the importance and effectiveness of prayer in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_god's_miracles.htm">Witnessing God's Miracles</a></b><br>The soldiers' confusion serves as a reminder that God's works can be a powerful testimony to unbelievers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_12_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_18_God_s_control_over_plans.htm">How does Acts 12:18 illustrate God's sovereignty over human plans and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faith_from_Acts_12_18_guards.htm">What lessons on faith can we learn from the guards' reaction in Acts 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_18_s_link_to_divine_acts_in_Acts.htm">How does Acts 12:18 connect with other instances of divine intervention in Acts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_timing_in_tough_times_6.htm">How can we trust God's timing when facing seemingly impossible situations like in Acts 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_strengthen_faith_in_God_s_help.htm">What practical steps can we take to strengthen our faith in God's deliverance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_18_God_s_role_in_human_events.htm">What does Acts 12:18 reveal about God's intervention in human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_18_Divine_justice_challenged.htm">How does Acts 12:18 challenge our understanding of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Acts_12_18_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Acts 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/insights_from_day_38_on_spiritual_growth.htm">What insights does Day 35 offer on spiritual growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_women_teach_in_church.htm">Can women teach in church?

The literal dawn highlights several truths:<p>&#8226; God loves to unveil deliverance with the morning light&#8212;&#8220;God will help her when morning dawns&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing mirrors earlier rescues that also broke through the darkness, like the women discovering the empty tomb &#8220;very early on the first day of the week, at dawn&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It underlines Peter&#8217;s calm trust; he slept so soundly the angel had to strike him to wake him (<a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7</a>), yet by sunrise he is free&#8212;echoing how &#8220;His mercies are new every morning&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there was no small commotion among the soldiers</b><p>Herod had stationed four squads of four soldiers each (<a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>) and chained Peter between two of them. Now the guards face the unthinkable: the prisoner is gone while chains, doors, and sentries remain in place (<a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Roman honor code made an escape punishable by the guards&#8217; own deaths (compare <a href="/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a> when the Philippian jailer prepared to kill himself).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;no small commotion&#8221; is Luke&#8217;s understated way to describe panic, shouting, and frantic searching. God&#8217;s intervention turns human strength into confusion, just as in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a> where the enemy armies &#8220;turned on one another.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their uproar contrasts with the church&#8217;s peaceful prayer vigil (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5, 12</a>). While soldiers scramble, believers praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as to what had become of Peter</b><p>The final clause shows their utter bewilderment. They know Peter didn&#8217;t bribe them, pick a lock, or scale a wall; he simply vanished.<p>&#8226; Earlier the temple guards confessed a similar mystery: &#8220;We found the prison securely locked&#8230; but no one inside&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-23.htm">Acts 5:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter himself acknowledged the supernatural nature of his rescue: &#8220;Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me&#8221; (<a href="/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus once told Nicodemus, &#8220;The wind blows wherever it pleases&#8230; So it is with everyone born of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). Peter&#8217;s disappearance embodies that truth&#8212;the Spirit-led believer can move beyond human control when God so wills.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/12-18.htm">Acts 12:18</a> captures the dawn after a night of divine intervention. The morning light exposes powerless guards in turmoil while a servant of Christ walks free. Daybreak declares God&#8217;s timely mercy; the soldiers&#8217; commotion underscores the futility of resisting His purposes; and their question, &#8220;What became of Peter?&#8221; points to a sovereign Lord who moves His people where He pleases, confounding every earthly chain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">daybreak</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meras)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2250.htm">Strong's 2250: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day, the period from sunrise to sunset. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
