In the context of Acts, this reflects the early church's growth and the spread of the Gospel beyond Jerusalem. The attention of the crowds can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He instructs His disciples to be His witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. The receptiveness of the people also highlights the work of the Holy Spirit in preparing hearts to receive the Gospel.<p><b>to Philip&#8217;s message</b><br>Philip, one of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, is now seen taking on a more evangelistic role. His message would have centered on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the call to repentance and faith. This aligns with the apostolic teaching found throughout the New Testament. Philip's role as an evangelist is significant, as it demonstrates the spread of the Gospel to Samaria, a region with historical tensions with the Jews (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). This outreach to Samaritans is a precursor to the broader Gentile mission.<p><b>and to the signs they saw him perform</b><br>The signs performed by Philip served to authenticate his message, much like the miracles of Jesus and the apostles. These signs would have included healings and exorcisms, as indicated in the surrounding verses (<a href="/acts/8-7.htm">Acts 8:7</a>). The performance of signs and wonders is a recurring theme in Acts, serving as a divine endorsement of the Gospel message. This mirrors the ministry of Jesus, who performed miracles to demonstrate the coming of God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>). The signs also fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messianic age, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of miraculous healings accompanying the arrival of God's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip is now an evangelist spreading the Gospel in Samaria.
