Peter is addressing the crowd's misunderstanding of the events occurring at Pentecost, where some accused the apostles of being drunk. The use of "No" indicates a strong denial and sets the stage for a clarification based on Scripture.<p><b>this is what was spoken</b><br>Peter emphasizes that the events they are witnessing are not random or chaotic but are a fulfillment of prophecy. This phrase underscores the importance of prophecy in understanding God's plan and the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. It highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in revealing truth and fulfilling God's promises.<p><b>by the prophet Joel:</b><br>Peter references the prophet Joel, an Old Testament figure whose writings are part of the Minor Prophets. Joel's prophecy, found in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a>, speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit in the last days. This connection to Joel underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the inauguration of a new era in salvation history. It also highlights the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.
