The act of weeping openly signifies genuine sorrow and affection, reflecting the close-knit community within the early church. In the cultural context of the time, public displays of emotion were not uncommon, especially in moments of farewell or loss. This scene underscores the impact of Paul's ministry and the love he fostered among the believers. The weeping also indicates the gravity of the moment, as Paul had warned them of the challenges and persecutions that lay ahead (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-31</a>).<p><b>as they embraced Paul</b><br>The act of embracing is a physical expression of love and fellowship. In the Greco-Roman world, such gestures were common among friends and family, symbolizing unity and mutual support. This embrace signifies the strong spiritual and personal connection between Paul and the Ephesian elders. It also reflects the biblical principle of unity in the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>, where believers are encouraged to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<p><b>and kissed him</b><br>Kissing was a customary greeting and farewell gesture in the ancient Near East, often used to show respect, affection, and loyalty. In the New Testament, the "holy kiss" is mentioned as a sign of Christian fellowship (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>). This act of kissing Paul is a demonstration of the deep respect and love the Ephesian elders had for him. It also serves as a poignant reminder of the personal sacrifices and relationships that are part of Christian ministry. The kiss, in this context, is a symbol of the heartfelt connection and the sorrow of parting, as Paul had shared his life and teachings with them, embodying the love of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle Paul, a central figure in the New Testament, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.
