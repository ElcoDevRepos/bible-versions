This age marks a pivotal moment in Moses' life, as he transitions from his Egyptian upbringing to his role as a leader of the Israelites. The number forty is seen throughout Scripture, such as the forty days and nights of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Moses' life is traditionally divided into three forty-year periods: his time in Egypt, his time in Midian, and his leadership of Israel.<p><b>he decided to visit his brothers</b><br>This decision indicates a turning point in Moses' identity and allegiance. Raised in Pharaoh's palace, Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (<a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a>), yet he felt a connection to his Hebrew heritage. This visit signifies his growing awareness and concern for his people, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24-25</a>, which highlights Moses' choice to be identified with the people of God rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin in Egypt.<p><b>the children of Israel</b><br>The term "children of Israel" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who became a great nation as promised by God (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). At this time, they were living in Egypt under harsh conditions, fulfilling the prophecy given to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own and enslaved for four hundred years (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).

Stephen&#8217;s speech (<a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20-22</a>) affirms God&#8217;s hand on Moses &#8220;from birth,&#8221; showing that every stage of Moses&#8217; life is under divine direction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was forty years old</b><p>&#8220;Forty&#8221;

God waited until Moses&#8217; natural strength and Egyptian prestige had matured, then began reshaping him for a spiritual mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he decided</b><p>&#8220;Moses considered reproach for the sake of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb Stephen uses shows deliberate, settled intent; Moses&#8217; choice wasn&#8217;t impulsive but a conviction wrought by God.<p>&#8226;

The word &#8220;visit&#8221; in Scripture often carries the idea of compassionate intervention (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>; <a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his brothers</b><p>&#8220;For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one;

Spiritual kinship outweighs social status&#8212;an enduring biblical principle (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the children of Israel.</b><p>&#8220;God spoke to Moses, &#8216;I am the God of your fathers&#8212;the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8217;
