The "Jews" here refers to the Jewish leaders who were opposed to the message of the Gospel that Paul and Barnabas were preaching. This opposition is a recurring theme in Acts, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a> and <a href="/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>. The "religious women of prominence" indicates women who held significant social influence, possibly due to their wealth or connections. In the Greco-Roman world, women could hold considerable sway in religious and civic matters, as seen in other historical accounts. The "leading men of the city" were likely members of the local council or influential citizens. This collaboration between Jewish leaders and Gentile authorities against the apostles mirrors the opposition Jesus faced, as seen in <a href="/luke/23.htm">Luke 23:1-2</a>, where Jewish leaders incited Roman authorities against Him.<p><b>They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas</b><br>The phrase "stirred up persecution" suggests a deliberate and organized effort to oppose Paul and Barnabas. This persecution is not merely social ostracism but likely involved legal and physical threats, as seen in other parts of Acts (<a href="/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>, <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-24</a>). The opposition to the Gospel often involved both Jewish and Gentile authorities, reflecting the spiritual battle against the spread of Christianity. This persecution fulfills Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>, where He warned His disciples that they would face persecution for His name's sake. The apostles' experience here is a type of Christ's own suffering and rejection, emphasizing the cost of discipleship.<p><b>and drove them out of their district.</b><br>The expulsion of Paul and Barnabas from the district signifies a rejection of the Gospel message by the local authorities. This act of driving them out is reminiscent of Jesus' instruction to His disciples in <a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>, where He advised them to shake the dust off their feet as a testimony against those who do not receive them. The apostles' departure from Pisidian Antioch does not mark a failure but rather a strategic move in the spread of the Gospel, as they continue their missionary journey to other regions. This pattern of rejection and continued mission work is seen throughout Acts, highlighting the resilience and determination of the early church in fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Early Christian missionaries who were spreading the Gospel.

This is not a blanket condemnation of all Jews; rather, it highlights a group resistant to the message of salvation in Christ (cf. <a href="/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>).<p>- Their resistance fulfills Jesus&#8217; warning: &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;however&#8221; contrasts their reaction with the many Gentiles who &#8220;rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord&#8221; the previous Sabbath (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>incited the religious women of prominence and the leading men of the city</b><p>- Opposition enlisted people of influence&#8212;&#8220;religious women of prominence&#8221; and civic leaders. Social status did not shield them from spiritual manipulation (cf. <a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a>, where the chief priests &#8220;stirred up the crowd&#8221;).<p>- Religious women likely had access to synagogue life and could sway public sentiment. Leading men held civic authority, making the opposition both cultural and political.<p>- This coordinated effort shows how spiritual conflict often harnesses societal power structures (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas</b><p>- Persecution escalated from verbal contradiction (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>) to organized hostility.<p>- Similar pattern:<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;Gentiles and Jews plan to stone Paul and Barnabas.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22&#8211;24</a>&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;mob action leads to imprisonment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;&#8220;Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s promise stands: persecution cannot thwart His purpose; instead, it advances the spread of the word (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drove them out of their district</b><p>- Forced expulsion ended one chapter of ministry but opened another: &#8220;So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a>), obeying Jesus&#8217; directive in <a href="/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>.<p>- This act signified deliverance from accountability for the hearers&#8217; rejection while trusting God with the results.<p>- Despite the hostility, &#8220;the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-52.htm">Acts 13:52</a>), underscoring that outward opposition cannot rob believers of inner assurance (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a> portrays a real historical moment when influential Jews, supported by prominent women and civic leaders, orchestrated persecution to silence Paul and Barnabas, finally expelling them from the region. The passage demonstrates the predictable clash between the Gospel and entrenched religious or social power, yet it also reveals God&#8217;s sovereign pattern: opposition propels the mission forward, believers respond with steadfast obedience, and the joy of the Holy Spirit triumphs over hostility.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(50) <span class= "bld">The Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women.</span>--The fact stated brings before us another feature of the relations between Jews and Gentiles at this period. They "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte" (<a href="/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>). They found it easier to make proselytes of women. Such conversions had their good and their bad sides. In many cases there was a real longing for a higher and purer life than was found in the infinite debasement of Greek and Roman society, which found its satisfaction in the life and faith of Israel. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-12.htm" title="Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.">Acts 17:12</a>.) But with many, such as Juvenal speaks of when he describes (<span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 542) the Jewish teacher who gains influence over women--<p>"Arcanam Judaea tremens mendicat in aurem<p>Interpres legum Solymarum"--<p>["The trembling Jewess whispers in her ear,<p>And tells her of the laws of Solymse,"]<span class= "note">[3][3] Solymae, of course, stands for Jerusalem.</span><p>the change brought with it new elements of superstition and weakness, and absolute submission of conscience to its new directors, and thus the Rabbis were often to the wealthier women of Greek and Roman cities what Jesuit confessors were in France and Italy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Here we get the darker side of the picture. The Jews stir up the women of the upper class, and they stir up their husbands. The latter were content apparently to acquiesce in their wives accepting the Judaism with which they had become familiar, but resented the intrusion of a new and, in one sense, more exacting doctrine. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> <span class="accented">- Urged on</span> for <span class="accented">stirred up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the devout women of honorable estate</span> for <span class="accented">the devout and honorable women</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">stirred up a</span> for <span class="accented">raised</span>, A.V.; cast <span class="accented">them out of their borders</span> for <span class="accented">expelled them out of their coasts</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Urged on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).
