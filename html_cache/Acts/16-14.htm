Afra, Graeca, Syra, are familiar examples of like names. "Lydia" occurs, it will be remembered, once and again, in Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 14; iii. 9). Thyatira, one of the cities in the valley of the Lycus, was, like many other towns of Asia Minor, famous for its dyeing works, especially for purple, or crimson, which rivalled the fame of Tyre or Miletus (Strabo, xiii. 4, ? 14). Inscriptions found on the spot bear witness to the existence of a guild, or corporation, of purple-sellers, with which Lydia doubtless was connected. In <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-18.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things said the Son of God, who has his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;">Revelation 2:18</a>, it appears as one of the seven churches to which special epistles were to be sent from their divine Head. It had been founded as a colony, in the modern sense of the term, from Macedonia, as the sequel of the conquest of the Persian monarchy by Alexander the Great, and this may in part explain Lydia's presence at Philippi. The fact that she, and not her husband, is named as the purple-seller, is at least presumptive evidence that she was carrying on the business by herself.<p><span class= "bld">Which worshipped God.</span>--She was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a proselyte (see Note on <a href="/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>), and, as the sequel shows, one of the better type, drawn to Judaism, not by superstitious fear, or weak credulity, but by the higher ethical and spiritual teaching which it presented.<p><span class= "bld">Heard.</span>--For "heard" read <span class= "ital">was listening.</span><p><span class= "bld">Whose heart the Lord opened.</span>--The scene is one which might well call for the master touches of a great painter.

Thyatira was in Lydia. Lydian women, from the time of Homer downwards, were famous for their purple dyes; and it appears from an inscription found in Thyatira, that there was there a guild of dyers, called <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (Lewin, 2:214). <span class="cmt_word">One that worshipped God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a proselyte. So in <a href="/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a> we find <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> the <span class="accented">devout</span> or <span class="accented">religious</span> proselytes. And so <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="accented">devout</span> women. And so, in <a href="/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>, Justus is described as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> one who worshipped God (see too <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 17</a>). In <a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a> Cornelius is spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. It has been suggested that possibly Euodias and Syntyche (<a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>) were of the same class, and converted at the same time as Lydia. There is certainly a coincidence between the mention of the women in ver. 13 and the prominence given to the Philippian women in <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>. It is well observed by Chrysostom, on the latter part of this verse, "<span class="accented">The</span> opening of the heart was God's work, the attending was hers: so that it was both God's doing and man's" (camp. <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="accented">To open</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is applied as here to the heart (2 Macc. 1:4); to the eyes (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>); to the ears (<a href="/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34, 35</a>); to the understanding (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>); to the Scriptures (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>); "Corclausum per se.
