The term "brothers" reflects the early Christian practice of referring to fellow believers as family, emphasizing the unity and community within the body of Christ. This aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>, which speaks of believers being one body in Christ. The presence of these brothers suggests the spread of Christianity even before Paul's arrival, possibly due to the dispersion of Jews and early Christian missionaries.<p><b>who invited us to spend the week with them.</b><br>The hospitality shown by these brothers is a testament to the Christian virtue of welcoming and supporting fellow believers, as encouraged in <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>. This act of kindness would have provided Paul and his companions with much-needed rest and fellowship after their long journey. It also reflects the cultural practice of hospitality in the ancient world, where travelers often relied on the generosity of others for lodging and sustenance.<p><b>And so we came to Rome.</b><br>This marks the fulfillment of Paul's long-standing desire to visit Rome, as expressed in <a href="/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10-11</a>.

Paul's arrival in Rome is significant in the narrative of Acts, as it represents the Gospel reaching the center of the known world, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth."

Who had been the agents in preaching the gospel there we can only conjecture, but a city which was <span class= "ital">en rapport,</span> like Puteoli, with both Alexandria and Rome, may have received it from either. One or two coincidences, however, tend to the former rather than the latter conclusion. We find in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm" title="And let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works:">Hebrews 10:24</a> a salutation sent from "those of (or, better, <span class= "ital">from</span>) Italy." This would not be a natural way of speaking of Christians of Rome, and we are led, therefore, to think of some other Italian Church. The only such Church, however, of which we read in the New Testament is this of Puteoli, and we naturally infer that the writer of that Epistle refers to it. But the writer was, in the judgment of many critics (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Epistle to the Hebrews</span>), none other than Apollos, the eloquent Alexandrian Jew of <a href="/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24</a>, and some have been led to think that it was addressed to the Hebrew disciples of the Therapeutae, or ascetic, class, in the Delta of the Nile. All these facts tend to the conclusion that there was a connection of some kind between Alexandria and some Italian Church, and the theory that that Church was at Puteoli, though not proven, at least combines and explains all the phenomena. We find from Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 12, ? 1) that there was a considerable Jewish element in the population of Puteoli. They had, indeed, spread themselves through the greater part of Italy, and the remains of a Jewish cemetery have been found even near Perugia.<p><span class= "bld">Were desired to tarry with them seven days.</span>--As before at Troas (<a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>) and Tyre (<a href="/acts/21-4.htm" title="And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:4</a>), so here, we can scarcely fail to connect the duration of St. Paul's stay at Puteoli with the wish of the Church there, that he should be with them on one, or, it may be, two Sundays, that so he might break bread with them, and that they might profit by his teaching. The kindness of the centurion is seen once more in the permission which made compliance with the request possible.<p><span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">so we went</span> <span class= "bld">toward Rome.--</span>The journey would lead them through Cumae and Liternum to Sinuessa, a distance of thirty-three miles from Puteoli. Here they would come upon the great Appian Road, which ran from Rome to Brundusium, the modern <span class= "ital">Brindisi.</span> The stages from Sinuessa would probably be Minturnae, Formiae, Fundi, and Terracina, making altogether a distance of fifty-seven miles. At this point they would have to choose between two modes of travel, taking the circuitous road round the Pontine Marshes, or going by the more direct line of the canal. Both routes met at Appii Forum, eighteen miles from Terracina. For us well-nigh every stage of the journey is connected with some historical or legendary fact in classical antiquity. We think of the great Appius Claudius, the censor from whom the Via and the Forum took their names; of the passage in the over-crowded canal track-boat, with its brawling sailors, and of the scoundrel inn-keepers, whom Horace has immortalised in the narrative of his journey to Brundusium (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> i. 5). All this was, we may believe, for the Apostle as though it had not been. Past associations and the incidents of travel, all were for him swallowed up in the thought that he was now on the point of reaching, after long delays, the goal after which he had been striving for so many years (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>; <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Intreated</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came to</span> for <span class="accented">went toward</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. It is very interesting to find the gospel already planted in Italy. The circumstances of Purcell as the great emporium of African wheat made it a likely place for Christianity to reach, whether from Rome or from Alexandria (see <a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24</a>). Luke calls them <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). Perhaps the name of <span class="accented">Christian</span> was still rather the name given by those without, and that of "brethren," or "disciples," the name used by the Christians among themselves. What a joy it must have been to Paul and his companions to find themselves among brethren! <span class="cmt_word">Seven days</span>. Surely that they might take part in the service and worship of the next Sunday (see <a href="/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6, 7</a>). It is implied that the philanthropy of Julius (<a href="/acts/27-3.htm">Acts 27:3</a>) did not now fail. <span class="cmt_word">So we came to Rome</span>. The R.V. is undoubtedly right. 'We can trace in the anticipatory form of speech here used by St. Luke, simple as the words are, his deep sense of the transcendent interest of the arrival of the apostle of the Gentiles at the colossal capital of the heathen world. Yes; after all the conspiracies of the Jews who sought to take away his life, after the two years' delay at Caesarea, after the perils of that terrible shipwreck, in spite of the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners, and in spite of the "venomous beast," - Paul came to Rome. The word of God," Thou must bear witness also at Rome" (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>), had triumphed over all "the power of the enemy" (<a href="/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>). And doubtless the hearts both of Paul and Luke beat quicker when they first caught sight of the city on the seven hills. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[There]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3757.htm">Strong's 3757: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where, whither, when, in what place.
