It was a significant port city during the Roman Empire, known for its shipbuilding and maritime trade. The mention of an Adramyttian ship indicates the vessel's origin, suggesting it was likely involved in regional trade routes. This detail highlights the interconnectedness of the Roman world and the spread of early Christianity through these trade networks.<p><b>about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia</b><br>The "coast of Asia" refers to the Roman province of Asia, which is part of modern-day western Turkey. This area was a hub of early Christian activity, with cities like Ephesus playing a crucial role in the spread of the Gospel. The mention of sailing for ports along this coast suggests a journey through a region rich in both Hellenistic and Roman culture, where Paul had previously established churches and preached the Gospel.<p><b>and we put out to sea</b><br>This phrase marks the beginning of a significant journey for Paul, who is under Roman custody. The act of setting sail symbolizes the start of a perilous voyage that will ultimately lead to Paul's arrival in Rome, fulfilling his mission to preach the Gospel there. The sea journey also serves as a backdrop for demonstrating God's providence and protection over Paul and his companions.<p><b>Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us</b><br>Aristarchus is mentioned as a companion of Paul, indicating his loyalty and dedication to the mission. He is described as a Macedonian from Thessalonica, a city where Paul had previously preached and established a church (<a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17:1-9</a>). Aristarchus's presence underscores the unity and fellowship among early Christians, transcending regional and cultural boundaries. His companionship with Paul during this journey reflects the communal nature of the early Church and the shared commitment to spreading the Gospel. Aristarchus is also mentioned in other New Testament writings (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>), highlighting his ongoing role in Paul's ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adramyttian_ship.htm">Adramyttian Ship</a></b><br>A vessel originating from Adramyttium, a city located in the region of Mysia in Asia Minor.

20:6), underscoring the reliability of the narrative.<p>&#8226; Adramyttium was a port in northwest Asia Minor; a vessel from there would naturally sail northward and then eastward along the coast&#8212;perfect for the centurion&#8217;s plan to find a larger, west-bound ship later (<a href="/acts/27-6.htm">Acts 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail fits Paul&#8217;s earlier sea travel experiences (<a href="/acts/20-13.htm">Acts 20:13&#8211;16</a>) and aligns with his catalog of voyages in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, highlighting both the historical accuracy and God&#8217;s sovereign guidance through ordinary means like commercial shipping.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia</b><p>The ship was &#8220;about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia,&#8221;

Paul had ministered extensively in this region (<a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>; 20:18&#8211;21), so sailing these familiar waters must have reminded him of past gospel fruit and the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; These practical travel notes show God&#8217;s providence weaving together human planning and His larger redemptive purposes&#8212;as when Jesus declared the gospel would reach the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we put out to sea</b><p>Luke&#8217;s understated phrase, &#8220;and we put out to sea,&#8221;

(<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple departure blossoms into a dramatic narrative of storms, shipwreck, and eventual rescue, mirroring other biblical sea deliverances (<a href="/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23&#8211;30</a>;

Every detail&#8212;the specific vessel, the coastal itinerary, the loyal friends&#8212;demonstrates the Lord&#8217;s precise orchestration of history so that His servant can proclaim Christ before Caesar.

There would seem to have been but little direct intercourse by sea between Caesarea and Rome, and the voyage had therefore to be made, now in one ship, now in another. Changes of this kind occurred, it will be remembered, in St. Paul's journey from Philippi to Caesarea. Possibly it was at first intended that the prisoners should go to Adramyttium, cross to Greece, and then proceed by land. "Asia" is, of course, the proconsular province so called.

The subsequent alteration of plan (<a href="/acts/27-6.htm" title="And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.">Acts 27:6</a>), however, led to his accompanying him to Rome, and we find him there with St. Paul in <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>, sharing his imprisonment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Embarking in</span> for <span class="accented">entering into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which was about to sail unto the places on the coasts of Asia, we put to sea</span> for we <span class="accented">launched, meaning to sail by the coast of Asia</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span> for <span class="accented">one Aristarchus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Adramyttium</span> (now <span class="accented">Adra-myti</span>, where ships are still built), on the north-western coast of Asia Minor, south of Troas, on the gulf opposite which lies the island of Lesbos, was a place of considerable trade, situated on the great Roman road which connected the Hellespont with Ephesus and Miletus. <span class="cmt_word">Which was about to sail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the T.R.), describing the ship as a coasting-vessel, trading between Adramyttium and other ports on the coast of Asia. She was now on her homeward voyage. <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus</span>. He is first mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>, as a Macedonian, and one of Paul's companions at Ephesus, pro-badly, therefore, the fruit of his first visit to Thessalonica. We find him again with St, Paul on his last journey from Corinth to Asia (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and we gather from the present notice of him that he kept with him till he arrived at Jerusalem, and followed him to Caesarea. It would appear at first sight, from <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, that he not only stayed with St. Paul during his two years' imprisonment at Rome, but was his "fellow-prisoner," if at least the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> to be taken literally. This, however, is very doubtful, because in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:7) St. Paul calls Andronicus and Junius his "fellow-prisoners," though he was not then in prison himself; and also because, in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:23, 24), he gives this epithet to Epaphras, with the addition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> ("my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus"), and does not give it to Aristarchus, who is named in the same sentence as his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and Bishop Ellicott, on ibid.).
