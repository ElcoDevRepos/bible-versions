It was a Roman province, and the journey through Pisidia would have been challenging due to its mountainous landscape. This phrase indicates the missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas as they traveled to spread the Gospel. The region was known for its resistance to outside influence, which may have posed challenges to their mission. The mention of Pisidia connects to earlier passages in Acts where Paul and Barnabas faced opposition and persecution, highlighting their perseverance and commitment to their mission.<p><b>they came to Pamphylia</b><br>Pamphylia was a coastal region south of Pisidia, known for its fertile plains and strategic location along the Mediterranean Sea. It was a melting pot of cultures, including Greeks, Romans, and indigenous peoples, which made it a significant area for the spread of Christianity. The journey from Pisidia to Pamphylia suggests a transition from the interior regions to the coastal areas, where trade and cultural exchange were more prevalent. This movement reflects the strategic approach of the early missionaries to reach diverse populations. The mention of Pamphylia also ties back to <a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>, where John Mark left Paul and Barnabas, indicating a return to a previous location and possibly a reflection on past challenges and growth in their mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pisidia.htm">Pisidia</a></b><br>A region in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) known for its rugged terrain and diverse population.
