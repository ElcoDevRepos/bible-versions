This reflects the biblical theme of God's providence, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, where God is described as a "very present help in trouble." Paul's survival and success in spreading the Gospel, despite numerous trials, underscore the belief that God empowers and sustains His servants.<p><b>and I stand here to testify</b><br>Paul's role as a witness is central to his mission. The Greek word for "testify" (martureo) implies bearing witness, often in a legal sense. This aligns with <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus commissions His disciples to be His witnesses. Paul's testimony is not just personal but serves as a legal and spiritual declaration of the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>to small and great alike</b><br>Paul's message is universal, transcending social and economic boundaries. This inclusivity reflects the early Christian belief that the Gospel is for all people, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which states there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus. Paul's audience before King Agrippa and Festus exemplifies this, as he addresses both rulers and commoners.<p><b>I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen</b><br>Paul roots his message in the Hebrew Scriptures, affirming the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. This connection is crucial for validating Jesus as the Messiah to a Jewish audience. Prophecies from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the Pentateuch foreshadow the coming of Christ, His suffering, and His resurrection. For instance, <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> are often cited as messianic prophecies fulfilled in Jesus. Paul's argument is that his teachings are not novel but fulfill the ancient promises of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Paul is defending himself before King Agrippa.

Some MSS., however, have "witnessed to by small and great;" but this, besides the want of authority, and its involving an unusual construction, is at variance with the context. It was true that St. Paul's life was spent in bearing witness that Jesus was Christ. It was not true that he had a good report of all men. The words "small and <span class= "ital">great"</span> were significant as spoken when he was standing before two men like Festus and Agrippa. The phrase may be noted as occurring in <a href="/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>, and again in <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm" title="And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-5.htm" title="And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.">Revelation 19:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-18.htm" title="That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.">Revelation 19:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- The help that is from God</span> for <span class="accented">help of God</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">stand</span> for <span class="accented">continue</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">testifying</span> for <span class="accented">witnessing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nothing but what</span> for <span class="accented">none other things than those which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Help</span>, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, here only and in Wisd. 13:18, still of Divine help; in medical writers frequently, of aid from medicine and physicians; common also in classical writers, of auxiliary forces.
