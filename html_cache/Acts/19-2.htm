Ephesus was a hub of commerce and culture, making it a strategic location for spreading the Gospel. Paul often engaged with local believers and inquired about their spiritual experiences to ensure they had a full understanding of the Christian faith.<p><b>&#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the importance of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. Receiving the Holy Spirit is a key aspect of Christian conversion, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, where Peter emphasizes repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit empowers believers, as promised by Jesus in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, and is a seal of salvation (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; they answered,</b><br>The response indicates a lack of awareness or experience of the Holy Spirit among these disciples.

There he found some disciples&#8221; (<a href="/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul immediately discerns that something is missing in their experience. Earlier in Acts, whenever people truly trusted Christ, the Holy Spirit was present in power (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>; 8:17; 10:44).<p>&#8226; The apostle&#8217;s pastoral heart leads him to ask a diagnostic question, because receiving the Spirit is inseparable from authentic faith (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?&#8221;</b><p>Paul&#8217;s question assumes that the Holy Spirit is God&#8217;s promised gift to every believer from the first moment of saving faith (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>; <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording underscores that conversion and Spirit-reception are designed to coincide (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; In Acts, delays in receiving the Spirit only occur where God is highlighting a new stage of gospel expansion (<a href="/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15-17</a> Samaria; <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-47</a> Gentiles). Paul wonders if a similar situation exists here.<p>&#8226; His concern is not about a second blessing but about whether they have truly trusted in the risen Jesus and thus entered the New Covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a> with <a href="/hebrews/10-15.htm">Hebrews 10:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; they answered,</b><p>Their frank reply shows sincere openness yet reveals a gap in experience.<p>&#8226; Like Apollos before Priscilla and Aquila instructed him (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-26</a>), they possess partial knowledge.<p>&#8226; Their honesty prepares the way for Paul to explain the full gospel, reflecting <a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;Teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God often brings seekers to this point so the truth can be planted without confusion (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221;</b><p>These men were baptized &#8220;into John&#8217;s baptism&#8221; (<a href="/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3</a>), indicating they had responded to John the Baptist&#8217;s call to repentance but had not yet heard the complete message of Christ&#8217;s death, resurrection, and Pentecostal outpouring (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Their statement does not deny Old Testament references to the Spirit (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>) but shows ignorance of His New Covenant indwelling role (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul promptly explains Jesus as the promised Messiah, baptizes them &#8220;in the name of the Lord Jesus,&#8221; and lays hands on them; then &#8220;the Holy Spirit came upon them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/19-5.htm">Acts 19:5-6</a>), confirming the pattern of faith, baptism, and Spirit reception (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/19-2.htm">Acts 19:2</a> exposes a group whose understanding stopped with John the Baptist.

Their ignorance invites Paul to proclaim the full gospel, leading to their baptism in Jesus&#8217; name and the Spirit&#8217;s immediate, observable arrival. The passage affirms that salvation, baptism, and Spirit indwelling belong together, demonstrating God&#8217;s faithfulness to equip every true believer with His empowering presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?</span>--Better, as connecting the two facts in the English as in the Greek, <span class= "ital">Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on your conversion and baptism. We are left to conjecture what prompted the question. The most natural explanation is that St. Paul noticed in them, as they attended the meetings of the Church, a want of spiritual gifts, perhaps, also, a want of the peace and joy and brightness that showed itself in others. They presented the features of a rigorous asceticism like that of the Therapeutae--the outward signs of repentance and mortification--but something was manifestly lacking for their spiritual completeness.<p><span class= "bld">We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</span>--The standpoint of the disciples so exactly corresponds to that of Apollos when he arrived at Ephesus, that we may reasonably think of them as having been converted by his preaching. They must, of course, have known the Holy Spirit as a name meeting them in the Sacred Books, as given to the olden prophets, but they did not think of that Spirit as a living and pervading presence, in which they themselves might claim a share. They had been baptised with the baptism of repentance, and were leading a life of fasting, and prayers, and alms, but they had not passed on to "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost<span class= "ital">"</span> (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>).
