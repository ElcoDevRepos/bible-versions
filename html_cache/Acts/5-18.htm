Their arrest signifies the growing tension between the Jewish religious authorities and the burgeoning Christian movement. This was not the first time the apostles faced opposition; earlier in Acts, Peter and John were arrested for preaching about Jesus (<a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-3</a>). The religious leaders were threatened by the apostles' teachings, which challenged their authority and the status quo. The apostles' boldness in proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus was a direct challenge to the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection (<a href="/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>). This arrest highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>and put them in the public jail</b><br>The public jail was a common holding place for those awaiting trial or punishment. It was likely located in Jerusalem, where the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, convened. This act of placing the apostles in a public jail was intended to shame and intimidate them, as well as to serve as a warning to others who might follow their teachings. The public nature of the jail underscores the authorities' desire to make an example of the apostles. However, this setting also sets the stage for a miraculous intervention by God, as later in the chapter, an angel of the Lord frees the apostles, demonstrating God's power and favor upon them (<a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>). This event parallels other biblical accounts where God's servants are delivered from imprisonment, such as Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6) and Paul and Silas in Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage, the apostles were the early followers of Jesus Christ who were spreading His teachings and performing miracles in His name.

Opposition verifies Jesus&#8217; prophecy, tests the apostles&#8217; faith, unites the church in prayer, and sets the stage for divine intervention.
