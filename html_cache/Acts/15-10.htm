Testing God here implies challenging His will and grace, as seen in <a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>, where the Israelites tested God by doubting His provision. The context is the debate over whether Gentile converts should be required to follow the Mosaic Law, particularly circumcision, to be saved. This question challenges the understanding of salvation by grace through faith, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>by placing on the necks of the disciples a yoke</b><br>The "yoke" symbolizes the burden of the Mosaic Law, which includes numerous commandments and regulations. In Jewish tradition, the yoke often referred to the obligation to follow the Law, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>. Jesus spoke of His yoke being easy and His burden light in <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>, contrasting the heavy burden of the Law with the freedom found in Him. The imagery of a yoke also connects to agricultural practices, where a yoke was used to control and guide animals, symbolizing control and obligation.<p><b>that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?</b><br>This acknowledges the historical struggle of the Jewish people to fully adhere to the Law. The Law was given to reveal sin and the need for a Savior, as Paul explains in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>. The inability to bear the yoke of the Law highlights human weakness and the necessity of grace. The reference to "our fathers" connects to the history of Israel, where despite their covenant with God, they repeatedly failed to keep His commandments, as seen throughout the Old Testament, including in the narratives of the Judges and Kings. This phrase underscores the continuity of human inability to achieve righteousness through the Law alone, pointing to the need for Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of the apostles and a key leader in the early church, Peter is speaking in this verse during the Jerusalem Council.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A significant meeting of early church leaders in Jerusalem to discuss the requirements for Gentile converts to Christianity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish individuals who have come to faith in Jesus Christ and are central to the discussion at the Jerusalem Council.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers.htm">Jewish Believers</a></b><br>Jewish Christians who were advocating for the necessity of following the Mosaic Law, including circumcision, for salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_yoke.htm">The Yoke</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Peter to describe the burden of the Mosaic Law, which he argues is unnecessary for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_burden_of_the_law.htm">The Burden of the Law</a></b><br>The Mosaic Law was a heavy burden that neither the apostles nor their ancestors could bear.

Nothing but defeat and condemnation could be the issue of such a trial.<p><span class= "bld">To put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples.</span>--No words of St. Paul's, in relation to the Law, could be stronger or clearer than these. They reproduced our Lord's own language as to the "heavy burdens" of the Pharisaic traditions (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm" title="For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.">Matthew 23:4</a>) and His own "easy yoke" (<a href="/matthew/11-30.htm" title="For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:30</a>). They were echoed by St. Paul when he warned the Galatians not to be entangled again in the yoke of bondage (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm" title="Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.">Galatians 5:1</a>). The words that follow, on the one hand, speak out the experience of the Apostle himself in terms that are hardly less striking than those of St. Paul in <a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7-8</a>, though they deal with the Law in its positive rather than its moral aspects, and contain an implied appeal to the experience of his hearers.
