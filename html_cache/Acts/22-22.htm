The crowd's initial willingness to listen reflects their interest in his background as a Pharisee and his adherence to Jewish law. However, the mention of his mission to the Gentiles, which was seen as a radical departure from Jewish exclusivity, became a turning point. This moment highlights the tension between Jewish traditions and the emerging Christian mission to all nations, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Peter's vision and the inclusion of Cornelius.<p><b>Then they lifted up their voices and shouted,</b><br>The crowd's reaction is immediate and intense, indicating the deep-seated animosity towards the idea of Gentile inclusion without adherence to Jewish law. This reflects the cultural and religious barriers of the time, where Jews saw themselves as God's chosen people, distinct from Gentiles. The collective outcry signifies a communal rejection, reminiscent of the mob mentality seen in other parts of Acts, such as the uproar in Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-28.htm">Acts 19:28-34</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Rid the earth of him!</b><br>This phrase echoes the severity of the crowd's anger, akin to the cries for Jesus' crucifixion in <a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a>. It underscores the perceived threat Paul posed to Jewish identity and religious purity. The demand for his removal from the earth indicates a desire for capital punishment, reflecting the extreme measures some were willing to take to protect their traditions.<p><b>He is not fit to live!&#8221;</b><br>The declaration of Paul being unworthy of life highlights the gravity of his perceived offense. In Jewish law, blasphemy and leading others astray were punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-10</a>). Paul's message of salvation through Christ alone, apart from the law, was seen as heretical. This reaction also parallels the rejection of prophets in the Old Testament, who were often persecuted for delivering God's message, foreshadowing the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is giving his defense to the Jewish crowd in Jerusalem.
