The "ignorance of earlier times" refers to the periods before the revelation of the Gospel, when Gentiles were not held accountable for their lack of knowledge about the one true God. This reflects God's patience and forbearance, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, where God "passed over the sins previously committed." Theologically, this highlights God's mercy and the progressive revelation of His plan for salvation. Historically, the "earlier times" could refer to the pre-Christian era when paganism and idolatry were prevalent.<p><b>He now commands all people everywhere to repent</b><br>This phrase marks a significant shift in God's dealings with humanity. The command to "repent" is universal, extending beyond the Jewish people to include all nations. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The call to repentance is central to the Gospel message, as seen in <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>, where Jesus begins His ministry with the call to "repent and believe the Gospel." Culturally, this was a radical message for the Athenians, who were steeped in philosophy and polytheism. Theologically, repentance involves a change of mind and heart, turning away from sin and toward God, as emphasized in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, which states that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, a prominent rock outcropping located northwest of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.

The thought is one in which St. Paul manifestly found comfort. He sees in that ignorance a mitigation of the guilt, and therefore of the punishment due to the heathen world. The past history of the world had shown a praetermission of the sins, for which, on the condition of repentance, men were now offered a full remission. (See Note on <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>.) In thus teaching he was reproducing what our Lord had taught as to the servant who "knew not his Lord's will," and should therefore be beaten, but with "few stripes." (See Note on <a href="/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And now commandeth all men every where to repent.</span>--At this point the feelings of both Stoics and Epicureans would almost inevitably undergo a change. The latter might regret the mistakes he had made in his search after the <span class= "ital">maximum</span> of enjoyment, but a change such as the Greek for "repentance" implied--new aims and purposes, loathing of the past and efforts for the future--was altogether alien to his thoughts. From the Stoics, as measured by Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, better things might perhaps have been expected, but the doctrine of Necessity, which entered largely into popular Stoicism, blunted their sense of responsibility. They accepted the consequences of their actions with a serene apathy; for the most part, they gave thanks, as the philosophic Emperor did, that they were not as other men, and that the events of their life had led them to an ethical completeness; but the idea of abhorring themselves, and repenting in dust and ashes, had not as yet dawned on the Stoic's thoughts.
