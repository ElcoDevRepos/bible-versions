The context is crucial: Paul encountered some disciples who had only received John's baptism, which was a baptism of repentance, preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). The "hearing" indicates their understanding and acceptance of the full gospel message, which includes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p><b>they were baptized</b><br>Baptism here signifies a public declaration of faith and identification with Jesus Christ. In the early church, baptism was an immediate response to belief in Jesus (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, <a href="/acts/8-36.htm">Acts 8:36-38</a>). It symbolizes the believer's death to sin and resurrection to a new life in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). The act of baptism in water is a significant step of obedience and a means of grace, marking the believer's entry into the Christian community.<p><b>into the name of the Lord Jesus</b><br>Being baptized "into the name of the Lord Jesus" signifies allegiance and submission to Jesus as Lord and Savior. This phrase emphasizes the authority and power of Jesus' name (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). In the cultural context of the time, a name represented the essence and authority of a person. Thus, being baptized into Jesus' name means entering into a covenant relationship with Him, acknowledging His lordship, and receiving the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). This baptism contrasts with John's baptism, which was preparatory, pointing forward to the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.

But the candidate always first made a profession of his faith in Jesus Christ, as in the A.V. of <a href="/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>; and the effect of baptism was an incorporation into Christ so as to partake of his death unto sin and his life unto righteousness. It was, therefore, a true and compendious description of baptism, to speak of it as a baptism in (or into) the Name of Jesus Christ. (See the Baptismal Service in the Book of Common Prayer.)
