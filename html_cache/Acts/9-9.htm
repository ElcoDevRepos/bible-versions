In the Old Testament, Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>), which Jesus later referenced as a sign of His own death and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The three days Saul spent in darkness can be seen as a time of reflection and repentance, preparing him for his new mission as Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles.<p><b>he was without sight</b><br>Saul's physical blindness is symbolic of his spiritual blindness. Before this encounter, Saul was zealous in his persecution of Christians, unable to see the truth of Jesus as the Messiah. His blindness serves as a metaphor for his previous spiritual state and highlights the transformative power of Christ. This temporary blindness also emphasizes the dramatic change that will occur in Saul's life, as he moves from persecutor to proponent of the faith.<p><b>and he did not eat or drink anything</b><br>Fasting is a common biblical practice associated with mourning, repentance, and seeking God's guidance. Saul's abstention from food and drink indicates a period of deep spiritual reflection and penitence. In the Jewish tradition, fasting is often a sign of humility and submission to God, as seen in the practices of figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>).

Saul&#8217;s wait echoes that pattern of death-to-life transition, underscoring that God was about to raise him from spiritual death to new ministry life.<p>&#8226; The period was long enough for true reflection yet short enough to highlight God&#8217;s swift mercy (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was without sight</b><p>&#8226; The blinding light on the Damascus road left Saul literally blind (<a href="/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>). The Lord used a physical condition to picture Saul&#8217;s former spiritual state&#8212;&#8220;Though seeing, they do not see&#8221; (cf. <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Blindness forced dependence. Instead of leading others against believers, Saul now had to be led by the hand (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a>), a vivid reminder that salvation begins when pride is broken (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God alone restores sight: &#8220;The LORD opens the eyes of the blind&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>). Ananias&#8217; later touch confirmed this truth and the church&#8217;s role in Saul&#8217;s new life (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did not eat</b><p>&#8226; Fasting in Scripture often accompanies repentance and an urgent seeking of God (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). Saul&#8217;s silence at the table shows a heart stunned by conviction; he had persecuted the very Messiah he now met (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord told Ananias, &#8220;he is praying&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>). Fasting and prayer joined, displaying Saul&#8217;s wholehearted surrender (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a> reflects the same pattern in later ministry).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or drink anything</b><p>&#8226; A total fast&#8212;no food or water&#8212;matches the gravity of Saul&#8217;s experience, similar to Esther&#8217;s three-day fast before pivotal deliverance (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and Nineveh&#8217;s urgency under Jonah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical thirst mirrored spiritual thirst. Saul&#8217;s former zeal for the Law could not satisfy; now he longed for the living Christ who later used him to write, &#8220;I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a> records a divinely appointed pause. Three days of blindness, fasting, and prayer stripped Saul of self-reliance, impressed on him the seriousness of sin, and prepared him to receive sight, Spirit, and commission. The verse captures the moment between old life and new creation, showing that when Christ confronts a sinner, He also provides the grace-filled space for repentance, transformation, and future service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He was three days without sight.</span>--It is natural to think of this period of seclusion from the visible world as one of spiritual communion with the invisible, and we can hardly be wrong in referring the visions and revelations of the Lord, the soaring as to the third heaven, and the Paradise of God, of which he speaks fourteen or fifteen years later, to this period. (See Notes on <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1-4</a>.) The conditions of outward life were suspended, and he lived as one fallen into a trance--in the ecstacy of an apocalyptic rapture. (Comp. the analogous phenomena in <a href="/context/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1-4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Did <span class="accented">neither</span> for <span class="accented">neither did</span>, A.V. The same reason, we may venture to think, which caused the interposition of three days' blindness between Saul's conversion and his baptism, led Saul himself to pass those days in a voluntary self-abasement. His sin in persecuting the Church of God and its Divine Head, his guilt in assisting at the death of God's saints, and in rejecting the testimony to Christ's resurrection, had been very great. These three days of blindness and of fasting were therefore a fitting preparation for the grace of forgiveness about to be so freely and fully given to him (<a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12-16</a>). What thoughts must have passed through Saul's mind during those three days! Before passing on, it may be well to observe that it is to this appearance to him of Jesus Christ that St. Paul undoubtedly refers when he says (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>), "Have not I seen Jesus Christ?" and again (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), "Last of all, he was seen of me also," where he puts this appearance of Jesus to himself on a par with those to Peter and James and the other apostles, which made them competent witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. And so in ver. 17 of this chapter Ananias says, "The Lord Jesus which was seen by thee" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); and Barnabas (ver. 27), when he brought Saul to the apostles, related "how he had seen the Lord in the way." And in <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a> Ananias says, "God hath appointed thee to see the Righteous One." Moreover the description in ver. 7 of Saul's fellow-travelers, that they "saw no man," implies, by contrast, that Saul did. The reticence of both St. Paul and St. Luke as to what he saw, and what was the appearance of the Lord Jesus, seems to arise from profound reverence and awe, such as St. Paul speaks of in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>. It may be also worth remarking how this appearance of Christ was deferred till he was quite close to Damascus, according to one tradition only a quarter of a mile from the gates, but according to Porter, whom Farrar and Lewin follow, at a distance of about ten miles, at a village called Caueab. So the intervention of the angel by which Isaac's life was spared was not till Abraham had the knife in his hand to slay his son; and Peter's prison doors were opened not till the very night before he was to have been brought forth to death. Faith and patience are thus strengthened, and God's intervention is more marked. There is not the slightest trace in the narrative of what the fancy of many has suggested, that Saul's uneasy conscience was wrought up into a paroxysm as he approached Damascus, and so prepared the way for the vision of Christ. Even Canon Farrar's eloquent description of what he supposes to have been the thoughts which agitated Saul's mind on his eventful journey seems hardly to rest on any solid base (see 'Life of St. Paul,'vol. 1. <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[For]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">three</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(treis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5140.htm">Strong's 5140: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three.
