His life and reign were pivotal in establishing the kingdom of Israel and setting the stage for the coming of the Messiah. David's purpose included uniting the tribes of Israel, establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center, and preparing for the construction of the Temple. His generation was marked by significant military victories and the expansion of Israel's territory. David's psalms and his role as a prophet also contributed to the spiritual heritage of Israel. This phrase emphasizes the idea that each person has a divine purpose to fulfill in their lifetime, as David did in his.<p><b>he fell asleep</b><br>The phrase "fell asleep" is a euphemism for death, commonly used in the New Testament. It reflects the Christian belief in the resurrection, suggesting that death is not the end but a temporary state before being awakened to eternal life. This terminology is consistent with other scriptural references, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>, where Paul speaks of those who have "fallen asleep" in Christ. It underscores the hope of resurrection and eternal life for believers.<p><b>His body was buried with his fathers</b><br>David was buried in the City of David, which is part of ancient Jerusalem. This burial with his ancestors signifies the continuation of the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs. It also reflects the cultural practice of family burials, which was common in ancient Israel. The phrase connects David to the lineage of the patriarchs, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through his descendants, ultimately leading to Jesus Christ, the Son of David.<p><b>and saw decay</b><br>Unlike Jesus, whose body did not see decay, David's body underwent the natural process of decomposition. This distinction is crucial in the context of <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, where Paul is preaching about the resurrection of Jesus. The contrast between David and Jesus highlights the uniqueness of Christ's resurrection, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which states that God's Holy One would not see decay. This serves to affirm Jesus' divine nature and the power of His resurrection, setting Him apart from all others, including David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.
