His role in the council at Jerusalem (Acts 15) highlights his authority and respect among the apostles and elders. The use of "judgment" indicates a decision-making process based on wisdom and discernment, reflecting the early church's practice of seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit and Scripture.<p><b>that we should not cause trouble</b><br>The context here is the debate over whether Gentile converts to Christianity should be required to follow Jewish law, particularly circumcision. "Cause trouble" refers to placing unnecessary burdens on new believers, which could hinder their faith. This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a> about His yoke being easy and His burden light, emphasizing grace over legalism.<p><b>for the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian community was a significant shift from Jewish tradition, which saw Gentiles as outsiders. This decision aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God promises to make His people a light to the nations. It also fulfills the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>who are turning to God.</b><br>This phrase indicates a movement of faith and repentance among the Gentiles, aligning with the theme of conversion seen throughout Acts. It echoes the call to repentance found in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a> and highlights the transformative power of the Gospel. The phrase also connects to the parable of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, illustrating God's joy over sinners who repent and turn to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, James, is a leader in the early church and the brother of Jesus.
