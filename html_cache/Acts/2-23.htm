It reflects the theological concept that Jesus' death was not an accident or merely the result of human actions, but part of God's redemptive plan from the beginning. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant being crushed by the will of the Lord. The foreknowledge of God indicates His omniscience, knowing all events before they occur, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a> and <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>.<p><b>and you, by the hands of the lawless,</b><br>The "you" refers to the Jewish audience Peter is addressing, implicating them in the crucifixion of Jesus. The "lawless" are the Roman authorities who carried out the execution, as they were not under the Jewish Law. This highlights the collaboration between Jewish leaders and Roman officials in the death of Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where nations and peoples conspire against the Lord's Anointed. The term "lawless" also underscores the injustice of the trial and execution, as Jesus was sinless and undeserving of death.<p><b>put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross.</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious criminals and was considered a curse under Jewish Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). This method of death fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, which describes the piercing of hands and feet, and <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which speaks of looking on the one they have pierced. The act of nailing to the cross symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice for sin, as Jesus bore the punishment on behalf of humanity, aligning with the typology of the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, whose crucifixion is being discussed.

Second, human beings&#8212;Jews and Gentiles alike&#8212;freely chose to reject and crucify Jesus, making them responsible. The cross stands as history&#8217;s central event: divinely ordained, willingly embraced by the Son, wickedly carried out by sinners, and powerfully used by God to secure our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">By the determinate counsel and fore knowledge of God.</span>--The adjective meets us again in St. Peter's speech in <a href="/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>; the word for "foreknowledge in his Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a>), and there only in the New Testament. The coincidence is not without its force as bearing on the genuineness both of the speech and of the letter. It has now become the habit of the Apostle's mind to trace the working of a divine purpose, which men, even when they are most bent on thwarting it, are unconsciously fulfilling. In <a href="/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>, he had seen that purpose in the treachery of Judas; he sees it now in the malignant injustice of priests and people.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have taken</span>. . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">ye took, and by lawless hands crucified and slew.</span> Stress is laid on the priests having used the hands of one who was "without law" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-21.htm" title="To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.">1Corinthians 9:21</a>), a heathen ruler, to inflict the doom which they dared not inflict themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Delivered up</span> for <span class="accented">delivered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay</span> for <span class="accented">have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">The determinate counsel</span>.
