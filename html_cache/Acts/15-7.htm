This phrase indicates a lengthy deliberation, reflecting the gravity of the issue. The Jerusalem Council was a pivotal moment in church history, addressing whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish law, particularly circumcision. This discussion highlights the early church's struggle to define its identity and mission.<p><b>Peter got up and said to them</b><br>Peter, a leading apostle, often took a prominent role in the early church. His standing up signifies authority and the respect he commanded among the apostles and elders. Peter's leadership is evident throughout the Gospels and Acts, such as in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost. His actions here underscore his role as a bridge between Jewish and Gentile believers.<p><b>Brothers, you know that in the early days</b><br>Peter addresses the assembly as "brothers," emphasizing the familial bond among believers. "In the early days" refers to the initial spread of the gospel after Jesus' resurrection, a period marked by rapid growth and the Holy Spirit's work. This phrase recalls the early missionary efforts and the foundational experiences of the apostles.<p><b>God made a choice among you</b><br>This highlights divine sovereignty in the mission to the Gentiles. God's choice reflects His plan for salvation to extend beyond Israel, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations. It underscores the theme of God's initiative in salvation history, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>that the Gentiles would hear from my lips</b><br>Peter refers to his experience with Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where God directed him to preach to a Gentile household. This event was a turning point, demonstrating that the gospel was for all people. Peter's vision and subsequent actions were pivotal in breaking down Jewish-Gentile barriers, aligning with Jesus' command in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a> to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>the message of the gospel and believe</b><br>The core of Peter's message is the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins. The emphasis on belief highlights faith as the means of salvation, not adherence to the law. This aligns with Paul's teachings in Romans and Galatians, where justification by faith is a central theme. The inclusion of Gentiles through faith alone was a radical shift, affirming the universality of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.

Light is thrown on the character of the debate by St. Paul's account of the matter in <a href="/context/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2-10</a>. He did not even then bring out what he held and taught, in its fulness. He shrank from startling and offending the prejudices of his countrymen, and was content to argue that circumcision and the Law were not binding upon the Gentiles, to press the precedent of the case of Cornelius and the analogy of the proselytes of the gate. Privately, in interviews with Peter, James, and John, he had gone further, and had declared his convictions that for Jew and Gentile alike circumcision and the Law were hindrances, and not helps, to the spiritual life, and that faith working by love was everything. And they, as the history of the Council and yet more their Epistles show, accepted his teaching. Of all doctrines as to the development of the Christian Church that which sees in Peter, James, and John the leaders of a Judaising anti-Pauline party is, perhaps, the most baseless and fantastic. The fact that their names were unscrupulously used by that party, both in their lifetime and, as the Pseudo-Clementine <span class= "ital">Homilies</span> and <span class= "ital">Recognitions</span> show, after their death, cannot outweigh their own deliberate words and acts.<p><span class= "bld">Peter rose up, and said unto them.</span>--The position of the Apostle is one of authority, but not of primacy.

Where Peter had been in the meantime, and what he had done, we have no record. We can hardly believe, as the Romish theory implies, that he came from the imperial city to attend the Council. It will be noted, as has been said before (see Note on <a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>), that the Apostle speaks of this as having been the first admission of the Gentiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputing</span>, A.V., as in ver. 2; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for men <span class="accented">and</span> brethren, A.V., as in <a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>, etc.; you for us, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">by my mouth the Gentiles</span> for the <span class="accented">Gentiles by my mouth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Questioning</span>.
