Moses, as a central figure in the Old Testament, was a prophet, leader, and lawgiver. His words carried significant authority among the Israelites, and his prophecies were considered foundational to Jewish expectations of a coming Messiah.<p><b>&#8216;The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet</b><br>This prophecy speaks of a future prophet whom God Himself will appoint. The phrase "raise up" indicates divine action and selection, emphasizing that this prophet will be chosen by God, not by human decision. This aligns with the Jewish expectation of a Messiah, a divinely appointed leader who would guide and deliver Israel.<p><b>like me</b><br>Moses was a unique prophet who spoke with God face to face and led the Israelites out of Egypt. The comparison "like me" suggests that the coming prophet would have a similar intimate relationship with God and a significant role in delivering and guiding God's people. This is seen as a typology of Jesus Christ, who is considered the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy, as He is both a prophet and the Son of God.<p><b>from among your brothers</b><br>This indicates that the prophet would be an Israelite, coming from the Jewish people. It emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and His faithfulness to His promises. Jesus, being born into a Jewish family, fulfills this aspect of the prophecy, reinforcing His role as the promised Messiah to the Jewish nation.<p><b>You must listen to Him</b><br>This command underscores the authority of the coming prophet. Listening implies obedience and submission to His teachings and commands. In the New Testament, Jesus is often portrayed as one who speaks with authority, and His teachings are central to Christian doctrine. This phrase highlights the importance of heeding His words for guidance and salvation.<p><b>in everything He tells you</b><br>The scope of the prophet's authority is comprehensive, covering all aspects of life and faith. This reflects the belief that Jesus' teachings are complete and sufficient for guiding believers in all matters of faith and practice. It also points to the necessity of accepting Jesus' message in its entirety, as partial acceptance would not fulfill the command to listen to Him in everything.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the prophet who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Law from God on Mount Sinai.

The appeal is made to Moses in his two-fold character as lawgiver and prophet.

But the words had naturally fixed the minds of men on the coming of some one great prophet who should excel all others, and we find traces of that expectation in the question put to the Baptist, "Art thou the prophet?" (<a href="/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet?
