The "tabernacle of the Testimony" is the portable sanctuary that God instructed Moses to build, as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. It served as the dwelling place of God among His people during their journey through the wilderness. The term "Testimony" refers to the tablets of the Law, the Ten Commandments, which were housed within the Ark of the Covenant inside the tabernacle. The wilderness journey lasted 40 years, a period of testing and reliance on God's provision and guidance. The tabernacle symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel, emphasizing His holiness and the need for atonement and worship.<p><b>It was constructed exactly as God had directed Moses,</b><br>The construction of the tabernacle was a divine mandate, with God providing detailed instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai. This is recorded in <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>, where God specifies that the tabernacle should be made according to the pattern shown to Moses. The precision in its construction underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the sacredness of the space where God would dwell. The meticulous details highlight the order and intentionality of God's design, reflecting His character and the seriousness of worship.<p><b>according to the pattern he had seen.</b><br>Moses received a vision or revelation of the heavenly pattern, which he was to replicate on earth. This concept is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, where the earthly tabernacle is described as a shadow of the heavenly one. The pattern signifies the heavenly reality of God's presence and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the true tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The earthly tabernacle was a type, a foreshadowing of Christ's work of redemption and His role as the mediator between God and humanity. The adherence to the pattern also points to the importance of divine revelation and the need for humanity to align with God's heavenly purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/our_fathers.htm">Our Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the ancestors of the Israelites, particularly those who wandered in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle_of_the_testimony.htm">The Tabernacle of the Testimony</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place for God among the Israelites, constructed as per divine instructions given to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who provided the instructions for the construction of the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the pattern for the tabernacle from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_instruction_and_obedience.htm">Divine Instruction and Obedience</a></b><br>The construction of the tabernacle according to God's pattern underscores the importance of obedience to divine instructions.

Stephen reminds the Sanhedrin that:<p>&#8226; The &#8220;fathers&#8221; were redeemed out of Egypt and guided through the desert (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; God chose to dwell among them in a movable, tangible way&#8212;the &#8220;tabernacle of the Testimony&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; This portable sanctuary kept God&#8217;s presence central to camp life, whether the cloud stayed one night or many days (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The ark inside held the Testimony&#8212;the stone tablets of the covenant&#8212;which anchored Israel&#8217;s identity (<a href="/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20-21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-5</a>).<p>Stephen&#8217;s point: the very fathers whom his accusers revere carried evidence that God&#8217;s fellowship never depended on a fixed building but on obedient hearts following Him through every season.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was constructed exactly as God had directed Moses</b><p>The second clause focuses on obedience and precision:<p>&#8226; Moses received blueprints straight from God, &#8220;exactly as God had directed&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s craftsmen &#8220;did everything the LORD had commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a>), underscoring that worship is not shaped by human creativity but divine command.<p>&#8226; The repeated refrain &#8220;just as the LORD commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42-43</a>) highlights that blessing flows when God&#8217;s instructions are taken at face value (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; In following the blueprint, Israel enjoyed the visible glory of God filling the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>).<p>Stephen leverages this history to expose the religious leaders&#8217; irony: they cling to the temple yet ignore the very God who once filled a fold-up tent because Moses obeyed Him to the letter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the pattern he had seen</b><p>The phrase draws attention to heavenly realities:<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> echoes this verse, noting that the tabernacle served as &#8220;a copy and shadow of what is in heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God graciously unveiled a glimpse of His throne room to Moses, providing a &#8220;pattern&#8221; that anchored Israel&#8217;s worship to eternal truths (<a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness meant conforming earthly practice to heavenly revelation&#8212;an early picture of New-Covenant believers who now serve &#8220;in the Spirit&#8221; while awaiting the ultimate sanctuary (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By citing the pattern, Stephen anticipates his conclusion: God is not bound to Jerusalem&#8217;s temple; He has always pointed His people beyond symbols to Himself (<a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48-50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a> recalls God&#8217;s mobile dwelling with Israel, built precisely as He told Moses, reflecting a heavenly model. Stephen&#8217;s listeners prized the temple; Stephen reminds them that their own history shows God&#8217;s presence travels with obedient people rather than stationary stones.
