The timing is significant as it occurs during the early growth of the Christian church. The mention of her sickness and death highlights the reality of human mortality, even among the faithful. In the cultural context of the time, illness and death were common, and medical knowledge was limited. This event sets the stage for a miraculous intervention, reminiscent of Jesus' own miracles, such as the raising of Jairus' daughter (<a href="/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>).<p><b>and her body was washed</b><br>The washing of the body was a customary Jewish practice, signifying respect and preparation for burial. This act reflects the cultural and religious traditions of the time, emphasizing the community's care for the deceased. It also underscores the finality of death, as preparations for burial were typically made when there was no expectation of recovery.<p><b>and placed in an upper room</b><br>The upper room was often used for important gatherings and events, as seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12-13</a>). In this context, placing Tabitha's body in an upper room may indicate a place of honor or a space large enough to accommodate mourners. It also sets the scene for Peter's arrival and the subsequent miracle, drawing a parallel to the resurrection power demonstrated by Jesus. The use of an upper room connects to themes of hope and divine intervention, as it becomes a place where life is restored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabitha.htm">Tabitha (also known as Dorcas)</a></b><br>A disciple in Joppa known for her good works and acts of charity.
