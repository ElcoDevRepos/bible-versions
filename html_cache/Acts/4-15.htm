It held significant religious and political authority. The apostles Peter and John were brought before this council after healing a man in Jesus' name, which caused a stir among the people. The Sanhedrin's order for them to leave indicates a private deliberation, reflecting the council's concern over the growing influence of the apostles and the message of Jesus' resurrection. This setting underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and Jewish religious authorities.<p><b>and then conferred together.</b><br>The act of conferring together suggests a strategic discussion among the Sanhedrin members. They were likely debating how to handle the apostles without inciting public unrest, as the miracle performed was widely recognized and praised by the people. This moment highlights the Sanhedrin's struggle to maintain control and authority in the face of undeniable evidence of divine power. The council's deliberation reflects the broader theme of opposition to the gospel message, as seen throughout the book of Acts, and foreshadows the continued persecution of the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were preaching the resurrection of Jesus and performing miracles, which led to their arrest and appearance before the Sanhedrin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, composed of religious leaders such as the chief priests, elders, and scribes, who held authority over Jewish religious and civil matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_of_the_lame_man.htm">The Healing of the Lame Man</a></b><br>The miraculous healing performed by Peter and John at the temple gate called Beautiful, which led to their arrest and questioning by the Sanhedrin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the early Christian church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conference_of_the_sanhedrin.htm">The Conference of the Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The private deliberation by the Sanhedrin to decide how to respond to the apostles' actions and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_opposition.htm">Courage in the Face of Opposition</a></b><br>Peter and John exemplify boldness in proclaiming the gospel despite facing powerful opposition.
