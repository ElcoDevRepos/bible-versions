The terms "astounded" and "amazed" indicate a profound sense of wonder and disbelief. This response is consistent with other biblical accounts where divine intervention elicits awe, such as the reactions to Jesus' miracles (e.g., <a href="/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51-52</a>). The Holy Spirit's arrival at Pentecost fulfills Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, empowering the disciples to be His witnesses. The crowd's amazement underscores the supernatural aspect of speaking in tongues, a sign of the Spirit's work.<p><b>they asked</b><br>The questioning by the crowd suggests a search for understanding and meaning. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where people seek to comprehend God's actions, such as Nicodemus questioning Jesus in <a href="/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>. The inquiry reflects a common human response to divine mysteries, prompting further exploration and dialogue. It sets the stage for Peter's subsequent sermon, which provides clarity and context to the events unfolding.<p><b>&#8220;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</b><br>The identification of the speakers as Galileans is significant. Galilee was a region often viewed with skepticism and prejudice by Judeans, as seen in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a> when Nathanael questions if anything good can come from Nazareth. The Galilean identity of the disciples emphasizes God's use of the humble and unexpected to fulfill His purposes, aligning with the biblical theme of God choosing the lowly (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). This also highlights the fulfillment of prophecy, as <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> speaks of a great light coming from Galilee.
