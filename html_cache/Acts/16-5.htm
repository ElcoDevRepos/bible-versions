The strengthening of faith suggests that the teachings of the apostles, particularly Paul and his companions, were effective in deepening the believers' understanding and commitment to the gospel. This aligns with the broader narrative of Acts, where the Holy Spirit empowers the apostles to preach and teach with authority (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The strengthening of faith can also be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that He would build His church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). The use of the plural "churches" indicates that this was not limited to a single congregation but was a widespread phenomenon across different regions, likely including areas like Galatia, Phrygia, and Macedonia, where Paul traveled during his missionary journeys.<p><b>and grew daily in numbers</b><br>The growth in numbers reflects the dynamic and expanding nature of the early church. This numerical increase is a testament to the effectiveness of evangelism and the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting hearts and drawing people to Christ. It echoes the pattern seen earlier in Acts, where the church experienced rapid growth following Peter's sermon at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41, 47</a>). The daily growth suggests a continuous and sustained movement, not just sporadic conversions. This growth can be seen as a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructed His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The phrase also highlights the communal aspect of the early church, where new believers were integrated into a supportive and nurturing community, contributing to both spiritual and numerical growth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Key figures in the missionary journey, spreading the Gospel and

activity that precedes it (<a href="/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1-4</a>).<p>- It signals that what follows is the direct outcome of Paul and Silas delivering the decrees from Jerusalem and revisiting congregations (compare <a href="/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30-31</a>).<p>- Scripture often uses &#8220;so&#8221; to highlight God-ordained cause and effect, as in <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a> &#8211; &#8220;those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand were added.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the churches</b><p>- Plural, indicating multiple local bodies across the regions of Galatia and Phrygia just visited (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>).<p>- Each congregation matters to God; <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a> shows Jesus addressing seven distinct churches by name.<p>- The same Spirit unites them (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>), yet Luke honors their individual identity and growth.<p><hr

through His Spirit in your inner being.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s Word delivered through faithful servants produces resilience against false teaching and persecution (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the faith</b><p>- The definite article points to the objective body of truth revealed in Christ (Jude 3).<p>- Growth begins with doctrinal solidity: &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>- Luke shows that gospel clarity and church health are inseparable (<a

fruit and growing throughout the whole world.&#8221;<p>- True growth is God-given (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>) yet often accompanies obedient ministry strategies such as revisiting, teaching, and discipleship (<a href="/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>daily</b><p>- Continuous action; conversions were not sporadic.<p>&#8226; <a

daily discipleship, and the Spirit answers with daily harvest.<p>- Regular gospel proclamation and visible Christian community invite constant response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in numbers</b><p>- Luke openly celebrates numerical increase without embarrassment. Souls matter to God (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<p>- Numbers testify to God&#8217;s saving power and validate the church&#8217;s witness (<a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>).<p>- Yet the order of the verse safeguards priorities: strength in the faith precedes arithmetic growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a> shows that when churches hold fast to apostolic teaching, encourage one another, and stay mission-minded, God both deepens their faith and expands their reach.
