The Sanhedrin, composed of Pharisees and Sadducees, was responsible for religious and some civil matters. Paul's reference to the high priest and the Council underscores his former zeal and authority in persecuting Christians, highlighting his transformation. This testimony emphasizes the legitimacy of his mission and his previous standing within Jewish society. The high priest's involvement indicates the seriousness with which the early church was viewed as a threat.<p><b>I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus,</b><br>Paul's mention of letters indicates official authorization, showing the Sanhedrin's reach beyond Jerusalem. Damascus, a significant city in Syria, had a substantial Jewish population. These letters were likely orders to the synagogues in Damascus to assist Paul in identifying and arresting Christians. This reflects the early spread of Christianity beyond Judea and the Jewish leadership's concern over its growth. The reference to "brothers" suggests a shared Jewish identity, which Paul was exploiting to root out followers of "the Way."<p><b>and I was on my way to apprehend these people</b><br>Paul's mission was to arrest Christians, whom he viewed as heretical. "These people" refers to followers of Jesus, known as "the Way" (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>). This phrase highlights Paul's dedication to his task, driven by his belief in protecting Jewish orthodoxy. His journey to Damascus was a pivotal moment, as it was on this road that he encountered the risen Christ, leading to his conversion. This mission underscores the early church's persecution and the lengths to which Jewish authorities went to suppress it.<p><b>and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.</b><br>The intent was to bring Christians back to Jerusalem for trial and punishment, likely involving imprisonment or worse. This reflects the centrality of Jerusalem in Jewish religious life and the Sanhedrin's authority. The punishment was intended to deter the spread of Christianity and maintain religious purity. This phrase also foreshadows Paul's later experiences of being brought to Jerusalem under accusation, but now as a follower of Christ. It highlights the irony of his transformation from persecutor to persecuted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, recounting his past actions before his conversion to Christianity.

Paul roots his story in verifiable fact: &#8220;the high priest and the whole Council&#8221; (the Sanhedrin) knew his former zeal firsthand (cf. <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their potential testimony underscores that Paul&#8217;s former persecution of believers was not a rumor but sanctioned, public, and legal (cf. <a href="/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This appeal to recognized authority strengthens his defense before a Jewish crowd, much like Jesus appealed to John the Baptist&#8217;s testimony in <a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>.<p>&#8226; It also highlights the tragic irony: those entrusted with leading Israel were the very ones endorsing opposition to the Way (cf. <a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47&#8211;53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Letters&#8221; were official warrants, giving Paul extradition power beyond Judea (cf. <a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Damascus housed a large Jewish population; the leaders there are called &#8220;their brothers,&#8221; revealing the interconnected network Paul aimed to mobilize (cf. <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; This shows the reach of early opposition to the gospel, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; warning in <a href="/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a> that His messengers would be hounded from city to city.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s initiative&#8212;&#8220;I even obtained&#8221;&#8212;reveals his personal drive, echoed later in <a href="/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>: &#8220;as to zeal, persecuting the church.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was on my way to apprehend these people</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to a deliberate, proactive mission; Paul was no passive participant (cf. <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;These people&#8221; were believers in Jesus, viewed as a deviant sect within Judaism (cf. <a href="/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s journey becomes the stage for divine interruption on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a>), illustrating <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>: &#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bring them to Jerusalem to be punished</b><p>&#8226;

Paul later admits, &#8220;When they were put to death, I cast my vote against them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>), confirming the severity he intended.<p>&#8226; His plan mirrors Jesus&#8217; prophecy in <a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>: &#8220;They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-5.htm">Acts 22:5</a> records Paul&#8217;s own testimony of legal authority, militant zeal, purposeful travel, and intended punishment against followers of Jesus. Each phrase shows how thoroughly he opposed the gospel&#8212;backed by Israel&#8217;s highest court, armed with official warrants, driven by personal conviction, and determined to carry Christians to judgment. This backdrop magnifies the grace of Christ that halted him on the Damascus road and transformed the chief persecutor into the great apostle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">As also the high priest doth bear me witness.</span>--Annas is named as high priest at the time of St. Paul's conversion, acting probably with his son-in-law, Caiaphas, as his coadjutor. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>; <a href="/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>.) At the time which we have now reached, the office was filled by Ananias, son of Nebedseus, who owed his appointment to Herod Agrippa II., then King of Chalcis, to whom Claudius had conceded the privilege of nominating the high priests (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 5, ? 2).
