Corinth was a major commercial hub in the Roman Empire, strategically located on the isthmus connecting mainland Greece with the Peloponnese. This location allowed Paul to reach a diverse audience, including Jews and Gentiles. His time in Corinth is also significant because it was during this period that he wrote some of his epistles, such as 1 and 2 Thessalonians.<p><b>before saying goodbye to the brothers.</b><br>The term "brothers" refers to fellow believers in Christ, highlighting the familial bond within the early Christian community. This farewell suggests a strong relationship between Paul and the Corinthian church, which he had helped establish. The use of "brothers" underscores the unity and mutual support among early Christians, as seen in other passages like <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>.<p><b>He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made,</b><br>Cenchrea was the eastern port of Corinth, indicating Paul's departure point for his journey. The shaving of his head suggests a Nazirite vow, a Jewish practice described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>, where individuals would abstain from certain activities and shave their heads at the vow's completion. This act reflects Paul's Jewish heritage and his continued observance of Jewish customs, even as he ministered to Gentiles. It also demonstrates his personal devotion and commitment to God.<p><b>and then he sailed for Syria,</b><br>Syria was a Roman province that included cities like Antioch, which served as a significant base for Paul's missionary journeys. This journey back to Syria indicates Paul's intention to return to his sending church in Antioch, where he would report on his missionary activities and receive further guidance. The mention of Syria connects to <a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>, where believers were first called Christians in Antioch, highlighting the city's importance in early Christianity.<p><b>accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.</b><br>Priscilla and Aquila were a Jewish Christian couple who had previously worked with Paul in Corinth as tentmakers (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2-3</a>). Their accompaniment on this journey signifies their close partnership in ministry. Priscilla and Aquila are noted for their role in teaching Apollos, an eloquent preacher, more accurately about the way of God (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-26</a>).

The fact is noted as following on Gallio's repression of the enmity of the Jews. The Apostle could stay and work on without molestation. The time of his voyage was probably, as in the second journey from Corinth to Jerusalem, after the Passover, and before Pentecost. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a>.) It was the most favourable time of the year for travelling, and it brought the Apostle into contact with a larger number both of Hellenistic Jews and Hebrews than were found at other times. We can only infer, more or less conjecturally, the motives of his journey. (1) As afterwards, in <a href="/context/acts/20-3.htm" title="And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.">Acts 20:3-4</a>, he may have wished, in carrying out the terms of the compact with the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>), to be the bearer of alms collected for the disciples there. By some writers, however, this visit is identified with that of which St. Paul there speaks. (2) The vow which he had taken (see Note below) required a visit to the Temple for its completion. (3) There might be a natural wish to report, as in <a href="/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>, the results of his ministry among the Gentiles, in what, from the stand-point of Jerusalem, would seem the remoter regions of Macedonia and Achaia.<p><span class= "bld">Priscilla and Aquila.</span>--On the priority given to the name of the wife, see Note on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Having tarried after this yet many days</span> for <span class="accented">after this tarried there yet a good while, and then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Cenchreae</span> for <span class="accented">Cenchrea</span>, A.V.

It is used in the same sense in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11. 8:6). In a metaphorical sense it means" to renounce," "to bid adieu to" (<a href="/luke/14-23.htm">Luke 14:23</a>). Of the six times it occurs in the New Testament, four are in St. Luke's writings and one in St. Paul's. <span class="cmt_word">With him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae</span>, etc. There is great diversity of opinion as to whether it was St. Paul or Aquila who had the vow. Meyer thinks that the mention of Priscilla before Aquila, contrary to the order in ver. 2 and in ver. 26 (where, however, the R.T. reads "<span class="accented">Priscilla</span> and <span class="accented">Aquila</span>), is a clear indication that Luke meant the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., to refer to Aquila, not to St. Paul, and Howson takes the same view. But this is a very weak argument, refuted at once by <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, as well as by the whole run of the passage, in which Paul is throughout the person spoken of; or, as Alford puts it, in the consecutive narrative from ver. 18 to ver. 25, there are <span class="accented">nine</span> aorist participles, of which eight apply to Paul, as the subject of the section, making it scarcely doubtful that the ninth applies to him likewise. Moreover, there is no conceivable reason why the vow should be mentioned if it was taken by Aquila, and, what is still more conclusive, the person who went to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Paul, must be the one who had the vow, not the person who stayed behind, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Aquila. In fact, nobody would ever have thought of making Aquila the subject if it were not for the thought that there is an incongruity with Paul's character in his making a vow of that kind. But we must take what we find in Scripture, and not force it to speak our own thoughts. As regards the nature of the vow, it is not quite clear what it was. It was not the simple Nazaritic vow described in <a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18-21</a>; nor is the word here used by St. Luke (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the one which is there and elsewhere employed by the LXX., and by St. Luke himself in <a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>, of that final shaving of the hair of the Nazarite for the purpose of offering it at the door of the tabernacle (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). It seems rather to have been of the nature of that vow which Josephus speaks of as customary for persons in any affliction, viz. to make a vow that, for thirty days previous to that on which they intend to offer sacrifice, they will abstain from wine and will shave off (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) their hair, adding that Bernice was now at Jerusalem in order to perform such a vow ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 15:1). But it further appears, from certain passages in the Mishna, that, if any one had a Nazarite vow upon him outside the limits of the Holy Land, he could not fulfill such vow till he was come to the Holy Laud, to Jerusalem; but it was allowable in such case to cut his hair short (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and as some say to take it with him to Jerusalem, and there offer it at the same time that he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It would seem, therefore, that either in a severe illness or under some great danger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) St. Paul had made such a vow; that he had been unwilling to cut his hair short at Corinth, where he was thrown so much into the society of Greeks, and therefore did so at Cenchreae just before he embarked for Syria; and that he made all haste to reach Jerusalem in time for the Passover, that he might there accomplish his vow (see Bishop Wordsworth's note on Acts 18:18; and Farrar's ' Life of St. Paul,' 2. p. 2). His motives for the vow may have been partly those described on another occasion (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>), and partly his own Jewish feelings of piety showing themselves in the accustomed way. <span class="cmt_word">Cenchreae</span>.
