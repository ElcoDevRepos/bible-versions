This reflects the early Christian understanding of community and fellowship, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.

It was a significant location due to its position on the trade route between Egypt and Syria. The presence of a Christian community in Lydda highlights the spread of the gospel into diverse regions.

Together these verses highlight the gospel&#8217;s steady spread, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that witnesses would reach &#8220;the ends of the earth.&#8221;<p>- Peter&#8217;s willingness to leave Jerusalem mirrors Jesus&#8217; own itinerant ministry (<a href="/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>), underscoring that the apostolic mission was never meant to stay centralized but to reach every community the Spirit opened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went to visit</b><p>- The verb points to purposeful pastoral care. <a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a> records Paul suggesting, &#8220;Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city,&#8221; revealing that revisiting believers was normal apostolic practice.<p>- Shepherding, encouraging, and strengthening faith in person reflect Jesus&#8217; pattern in <a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a> when He &#8220;came up and walked along with&#8221; the disciples on the road to Emmaus.

By using it, Luke reminds readers that every follower of Jesus shares this holy status&#8212;encouragement for new Gentile converts soon to be welcomed (<a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Lydda</b><p>- Lydda (Old Testament Lod, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>) sat on the vital coastal road linking Jerusalem to Joppa and Caesarea, making it strategic for gospel expansion. <a href="/acts/9-33.htm">Acts 9:33&#8211;35</a> shows how Peter&#8217;s visit there leads to the healing of Aeneas and widespread turning to the Lord.<p>- The town&#8217;s mention signals continuity between God&#8217;s work in Israel&#8217;s ancient allotments and His New Covenant mission. It also foreshadows Peter&#8217;s nearby journey to Joppa (<a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36&#8211;43</a>) and then Caesarea (<a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>), where Gentiles first receive the Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a> captures Peter on the move, intentionally shepherding believers beyond Jerusalem. His travel fulfills Jesus&#8217; commission, his visit models pastoral care, his reference to &#8220;saints&#8221; affirms every believer&#8217;s holy standing, and his stop in Lydda positions the gospel for its next leap.

Under the grasping rule of Cassius, the inhabitants were sold as slaves (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 11, ? 2). It had, however, recovered its former prosperity, and appears at this time to have been the seat of a flourishing Christian community. In the wars that preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, it was partially burned by Cestius Gallus A.D. 66 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 19, ? 1), all but fifty of the inhabitants having gone up to the Feast of Tabernacles at Jerusalem, and was again occupied by Vespasian A.D. 68 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 8, ? 1). When it was rebuilt, probably under Hadrian, when Jerusalem received the new name of 'lia Capitolina, it also was renamed as Diospolis (= city of Zeus), and as such was the seat of one of the chief bishoprics of the Syrian Church. It was, at the time when Peter came to it, the seat of a Rabbinic school, scarcely inferior to that of Jabneh, and retained its fame after the scribes of the latter city had migrated to Tiberias. Gamaliel, son of the great Rabbi who was St. Paul's master, and himself honoured with the title of Rabban, presided over it, and was succeeded by the great Tarphon (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Cent. Chorogr.</span> c. xvi.). The question which we naturally ask, who had planted the faith of Christ there, carries us once more on the track of Philip the Evangelist.
