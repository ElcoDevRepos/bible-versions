His journey to Damascus was with the intent to arrest followers of "the Way" and bring them back to Jerusalem for trial. Damascus, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities, was a significant trade and cultural center in the Roman Empire. This journey highlights the early spread of Christianity beyond Jerusalem and into the broader Roman world. Saul's mission reflects the intense opposition the early church faced from Jewish authorities.<p><b>suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him</b><br>The suddenness of the light signifies divine intervention, marking a pivotal moment in Saul's life and in the history of the early church. The light from heaven is often interpreted as the glory of God, similar to the Shekinah glory that appeared in the Old Testament. This event is reminiscent of other biblical theophanies, where God's presence is manifested through light, such as the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. The light's heavenly origin underscores the divine authority and supernatural nature of the encounter. This moment is a type of conversion experience, symbolizing the transformative power of Christ's presence. Saul's encounter is a fulfillment of prophecies about the spread of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as Saul would become a primary apostle to the non-Jewish world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee known for persecuting Christians.

On this supposition Saul would traverse the chief scenes of our Lord's ministry, and be stirred to madness by the progress which the new sect had made in the cities of Samaria. It is, however, possible that he may have taken the road by the Jordan valley by which Galilean pilgrims sometimes travelled in order to avoid Samaria; but the former was beyond all question the most direct and best frequented road.<p><span class= "bld">He came near Damascus.</span>--The city has the interest of being one of the oldest in the world. It appears in the history of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/14-15.htm" title="And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.">Genesis 14:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), and was, traditionally, the scene of the murder of Abel. David placed his garrisons there (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2Samuel 8:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">1Chronicles 18:6</a>), and, under Rezon, it resisted the power of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm" title="And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelled therein, and reigned in Damascus.">1Kings 11:24</a>). Its fair streams, Abana and Pharpar, were, in the eyes of the Syrian leper, better than all the waters of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/5-12.htm" title="Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?

It was the centre of the Syrian kingdom in its alliances and wars with those of Israel and Judah (<a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9-10</a>; <a href="/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a>).

It had been taken by Parmenion for Alexander the Great, and again by Pompeius. It was the birth-place of Nicolaos of Damascus, the historian and rhetorician who is conspicuous as the counsellor of Herod the Great (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xii. 3, ? 2; xvi. 2, ? 2). At a later period it was the residence of the Ommiyad caliphs, and the centre of the world of Islam. The beauty of its site, the river which the Greeks knew as Chrysorrhoas, the "Golden Stream," its abounding fertility, the gardens of roses, made it, as Lamartine has said, a "predestined capital." Such was the scene which met the bodily eye of the fanatic persecutor. The historian does not care to dwell on its description, and hastens to that which met his inward gaze.
