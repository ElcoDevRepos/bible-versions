This sharp contention highlights the human element within the early church, showing that even apostles had disagreements. The Greek word for "sharp" (paroxysmos) indicates a strong, emotional conflict. This incident underscores the reality of conflict in ministry and the need for resolution. It also demonstrates that God can work through disagreements, as this led to the formation of two separate missionary teams, thus expanding the reach of the Gospel.<p><b>Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,</b><br>Barnabas, known for his encouraging nature, chose to support John Mark, who was his cousin (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). This decision reflects Barnabas's character as a reconciler and advocate for second chances. Cyprus was Barnabas's homeland (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), making it a logical destination for him to continue his ministry. The choice to sail for Cyprus indicates the strategic importance of the island in early Christian missions, as it was a familiar and receptive environment for Barnabas. This move also highlights the theme of God's providence, as John Mark later became a valuable asset to the early church, evidenced by his eventual reconciliation with Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- An apostle who played a significant role in the spread of Christianity among the Gentiles.

The warmth of previous affection, of a friendship begun probably in boyhood, and cemented by new hopes, and a great work in which both were sharers, made the breach between the two more painful. At this stage, both Barnabas and Mark disappear from the history of the Acts, but it will be worth while to note the chief facts in the after-history of each. (1) Probably Barnabas and Paul met again in the visit of <a href="/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>, unless, indeed, we refer the incidents of <a href="/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-13</a> to an earlier period, and then there was a yet further cause of division in his yielding to the dissimulation of the Judaising teachers. (2) In writing to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>) the Apostle names Barnabas as setting the same noble example as himself in labouring with his own hands and accepting nothing from the churches. (3) On the later life of Mark see the <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Mark's Gospel.</span> Here it will be sufficient to note that the discipline did its work. After labouring with his cousin in Cyprus, he appears to have returned to St. Peter, as his first father in the faith, and to have been with him at Babylon (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>). He and St. Paul met during the latter's first imprisonment at Rome (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>), and the Apostle learnt to recognise in him one who was "profitable to him for the ministry" (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), and whom he wished to have with him at the last. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - There <span class="accented">arose a sharp contention</span> for <span class="accented">the contention was so sharp between them</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">parted</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">so that</span> for <span class="accented">so sharp</span>... <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and Barnabas</span> for <span class="accented">and so Barnabas</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took Mark with him</span> for <span class="accented">took Mark</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sailed away</span> for <span class="accented">sailed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There arose a sharp contention</span>, etc. The sense "between them" must be supplied, if the English word "contention" is used.

This is the sense in which our English word "paroxysm" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. <span class="cmt_word">And Barnabas</span>, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in the nominative) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of <span class="accented">secondary</span> importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question <span class="accented">of primary</span> importance to "the work," and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. "While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity." <span class="cmt_word">Sailed away</span>. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the scene of the earliest mission (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (<a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The <span class="accented">paroxysm</span> had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Their disagreement was so sharp</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#958;&#965;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(paroxysmos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3948.htm">Strong's 3948: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stimulation, provocation, irritation, angry dispute.
