Peter's journey to the house of Cornelius marks a pivotal moment in the early Church, as it signifies the opening of the Gospel to the Gentiles. This act of entering a Gentile's home was culturally and religiously significant, as Jews typically avoided such interactions to maintain ceremonial purity.<p><b>Cornelius met him</b><br>Cornelius, a Roman centurion, is described earlier in Acts as a devout man who feared God, gave alms generously, and prayed continually. His meeting with Peter is the result of a divine vision, indicating God's orchestration in bringing the Gospel to the Gentiles. Cornelius's role as a centurion highlights the reach of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>and fell at his feet</b><br>This act of falling at Peter's feet demonstrates Cornelius's reverence and respect. In the cultural context, such gestures were common to show honor to someone of perceived higher status or divine connection. However, it also reflects Cornelius's misunderstanding of Peter's role, as he attributes to Peter a level of reverence that is due to God alone.<p><b>to worship him</b><br>Cornelius's attempt to worship Peter underscores a common misunderstanding of divine representation. In the biblical narrative, worship is reserved for God alone, and Peter's response in the following verses corrects this action, emphasizing that he is merely a man. This incident serves as a teaching moment about the nature of true worship and the role of apostles as messengers, not objects, of worship. It also prefigures the Church's ongoing struggle to maintain the focus on Christ rather than human leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his role in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion who is described as a God-fearing man.

That single step marks an obedience to the Spirit&#8217;s clear instruction: &#8220;Get up, go downstairs, and accompany them without hesitation&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-20.htm">Acts 10:20</a>).<p>- The scene echoes earlier moments when God called His servants to go somewhere unexpected&#8212;Abram leaving Ur (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>), Jesus entering Zacchaeus&#8217;s house (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>- For Peter, stepping inside foreshadows <a href="/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Who was I to stand in God&#8217;s way?&#8221; Obedience comes before full understanding.<p>- Christ Himself modeled this openness: &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). Peter is about to walk through a literal door so that Cornelius can walk through the door of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cornelius met him</b><p>- Cornelius doesn&#8217;t wait for Peter to knock. The centurion &#8220;was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24</a>).<p>- Like the Roman centurion who approached Jesus in Capernaum (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5&#8211;11</a>), Cornelius takes initiative, demonstrating faith that God will honor His promise.<p>- His willingness to meet Peter at the gate mirrors the prodigal&#8217;s father running to meet his son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). God often meets earnest seekers halfway (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fell at his feet</b><p>- The posture speaks volumes. Throughout Scripture falling at someone&#8217;s feet signals deep respect or urgent plea&#8212;Abigail before David (<a href="/1_samuel/25-23.htm">1 Samuel 25:23</a>), the healed leper before Jesus (<a href="/luke/17-16.htm">Luke 17:16</a>), the Philippian jailer before Paul and Silas (<a href="/acts/16-29.htm">Acts 16:29</a>).<p>- Cornelius is a military commander, yet he humbles himself. Rank, ethnicity, and accomplishments fade before the greater realities of God&#8217;s work (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>- The moment rebukes pride. If a centurion bows, how can any believer cling to self-exaltation? (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3&#8211;4</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to worship him</b><p>- &#8220;Worship&#8221; here reveals Cornelius&#8217;s limited understanding. He recognizes that Peter is God&#8217;s messenger but misplaces the honor. Immediately Peter corrects him: &#8220;Stand up; I too am a man&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-26.htm">Acts 10:26</a>).<p>- Scripture is consistent: worship belongs to God alone (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>). Even angels refuse it (<a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; 22:9).<p>- Peter&#8217;s refusal models true servant leadership (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>). He shines the spotlight upward, never allowing devotion to settle on himself (cf. <a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11&#8211;15</a> when Paul and Barnabas tear their clothes to stop the crowds).<p>- This safeguards Cornelius from idolatry and teaches every believer to discern between the messenger and the Message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25</a> captures the collision of obedience and seeking hearts. Peter&#8217;s simple step of faith and Cornelius&#8217;s eager, though misdirected, reverence set the stage for God to unveil the gospel&#8217;s reach. The verse reminds us to:<p>&#8226; Walk through the doors God opens, even when they challenge our traditions.<p>&#8226; Meet God&#8217;s messengers with humility, but reserve worship for God alone.<p>&#8226; Keep pointing others heavenward, refusing any glory meant for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</span>--The attitude was the extremest form of Eastern homage. So Jairus had bowed down before Jesus (<a href="/matthew/9-18.htm" title="While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.">Matthew 9:18</a>), so St. John bowed before the angel (<a href="/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>). Peter's answer, in strong contrast with the words and acts, the very ceremonial, of those who claim to be his successors, shows that he looked on it as expressing a homage such as God alone could rightly claim. For man to require or receive it from man was an inversion of the true order, The language of the angel in <a href="/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>--"See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-servant . . . worship God"--implies the same truth.
