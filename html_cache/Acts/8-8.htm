Joy is a recurring theme in the New Testament, often associated with the presence and work of God (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). This joy is not merely an emotional response but a deep-seated sense of fulfillment and peace that comes from salvation and the presence of the Holy Spirit. The joy experienced here is reminiscent of the joy at the birth of Jesus (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>) and the joy of the disciples after the resurrection (<a href="/john/20-20.htm">John 20:20</a>).<p><b>in that city</b><br>The city referred to is Samaria, specifically the city of Samaria, which was a significant location in the New Testament. Samaria was historically a region of tension between Jews and Samaritans, stemming from differences in religious practices and historical conflicts (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). The fact that there was great joy in Samaria signifies the breaking down of these barriers through the Gospel. This event fulfills Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses in "Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
