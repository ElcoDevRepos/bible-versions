His suffering was prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is described as a suffering servant. The suffering of Jesus is also a fulfillment of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where the blood of a spotless lamb was required for atonement (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>, <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>). This suffering was necessary for the redemption of humanity, as it satisfied the justice of God and demonstrated His love (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><b>He presented Himself to them</b><br>After His resurrection, Jesus made Himself known to His disciples and followers. This presentation was crucial for establishing the truth of His resurrection, which is the cornerstone of Christian belief (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). The appearances were not just spiritual but physical, as Jesus invited Thomas to touch His wounds (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>). This physical presentation underscores the reality of the resurrection, countering any claims that it was merely a spiritual or metaphorical event.<p><b>with many convincing proofs that He was alive</b><br>The convincing proofs included Jesus eating with His disciples (<a href="/luke/24-42.htm">Luke 24:42-43</a>), allowing them to touch Him (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>), and performing miracles (<a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>). These proofs were necessary to dispel doubt and to confirm the truth of His resurrection. The Greek word for "proofs" (tekmerion) implies evidence that is undeniable and conclusive. This was important for the early church, as the resurrection was a foundational truth that needed to be established beyond doubt.<p><b>He appeared to them over a span of forty days</b><br>The forty days is significant in biblical numerology, often representing periods of testing, trial, or preparation (e.g., Moses on Mount Sinai, <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; Israel's wandering, <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>; Jesus' temptation, <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). During this time, Jesus prepared His disciples for their mission to spread the gospel. The forty days also provided ample opportunity for Jesus to appear to many people, further validating His resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>).<p><b>and spoke about the kingdom of God</b><br>The kingdom of God was a central theme of Jesus' teaching throughout His ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). After His resurrection, He continued to instruct His disciples on this topic, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the kingdom and their role in its expansion. The kingdom of God refers to God's sovereign rule and reign, which was inaugurated through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers await its full realization (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this passage, who, after His resurrection, appeared to His disciples to confirm His victory over death and to teach them about the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who witnessed His post-resurrection appearances and received His teachings during the forty days.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teachings during this period, emphasizing the spiritual reign of God and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forty_days.htm">Forty Days</a></b><br>The period during which Jesus appeared to His disciples, symbolizing a time of preparation and transition, similar to other significant biblical events (e.g., Moses on Mount Sinai, Jesus' temptation in the wilderness).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/convincing_proofs.htm">Convincing Proofs</a></b><br>The evidence Jesus provided to His disciples to affirm His resurrection, strengthening their faith and preparing them for their mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is a historical and foundational truth of the Christian faith, supported by many convincing proofs.

No other New Testament writer uses it.<p><span class= "bld">Being seen of them forty days.</span>--St. Luke uses a peculiar and unusual word (it occurs twice in the LXX.: <a href="/1_kings/8-8.htm" title="And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.">1Kings 8:8</a>, and <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-19.htm" title="All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.">Tobit 12:19</a>) for "being seen," perhaps with the wish to imply that the presence was not continuous, and that our Lord was seen only at intervals. This may be noted as the only passage which gives the time between the Resurrection and the Ascension. It had its counterpart in the forty days of the Temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/luke/4-2.htm" title="Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungry.">Luke 4:2</a>), as that had had in the earlier histories of Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm" title="When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm" title="And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm" title="And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.">1Kings 19:8</a>). There was a certain symbolic fitness in the time of triumph on earth coinciding with that of special conflict. If we ask what was the character, if one may so speak, of our Lord's risen life between His manifestation to the disciples, the history of the earlier forty days in part suggests the answer. Then, as before, the life was, we may believe, one of solitude and communion with His Father, no longer tried and tempted, as it had then been, by contact with the power of evil--a life of intercession, such as that which uttered itself in the great prayer of John 17. Where the days and nights were spent we can only reverently conjecture. Analogy suggests the desert places and mountain heights or Galilee (<a href="/luke/4-42.htm" title="And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.">Luke 4:42</a>; <a href="/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>). The mention of Bethany in <a href="/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50</a>, and of the Mount of Olives in <a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>, makes it probable that Gethsemane may have been one of the scenes that witnessed the joy of the victory, as it had witnessed before the agony of the conflict. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Proofs</span> for <span class="accented">infallible proofs</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appearing unto them</span> for <span class="accented">seen of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning</span> for <span class="accented">pertaining to</span>, A.V. The addition of the words by many proofs makes it necessary to understand the words allowed himself (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) in the sense which it bears both in classic and Scriptural Greek, of <span class="accented">proved</span> or <span class="accented">demon-strafed:</span> "To whom he gave distinct proofs of his being alive after his passion;" the proofs follow - being "seen of them" for forty days at intervals, talking with them, and (ver. 9) "being taken up while they were looking." Doubtless, too, he had in his mind those other proofs which he records in <a href="/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>, and those referred to by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>). For this sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, see <a href="/acts/24-13.htm">Acts 24:13</a>, "to rove:" and Lysias's 'Oration against Eratosthenes' (p. 125), where the almost identical phrase occurs which we have here, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will prove both these things by many certain proofs." The A.V. rendering, "infallible proofs," was quite justified. Stephanus says, "De certo et indubitato signo dicitur apud Rhetoricos" ('Thesaurus,' 9216); and the technical meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in Aristotle is a "demonstrative proof," as opposed to a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which leaves room for doubt; and in medical writers, which is important as regards St. Luke, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the "infallible symptom." St. Luke, by the use of the word here, undoubtedly meant to express the <span class="accented">certainty</span> of the conclusion based on those proofs. Appearing unto them. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> of the Epistle of Barnabas, cap. 15, only occurs in the New Testament in this place. In the Septuagint of <a href="/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a> it is used of the staves of the ark within the veil, which "were not seen without." The idea intended to be conveyed, both by the use of this verb and by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> (by the space of), is that our Lord was not with the apostles always, as he was before the Resurrection, but that he came and again disappeared (St. Chrysostom). They were fleeting appearances spread over forty days. The nearly related substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, means "a vision," and is frequently used by St. <a href="/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; 26:19.
