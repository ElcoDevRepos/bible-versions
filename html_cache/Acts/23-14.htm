The chief priests and elders were part of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council in Jerusalem. Historically, the Sanhedrin held significant religious and political power, and their involvement suggests the seriousness of the conspiracy. This reflects the tension between early Christians and Jewish authorities, as seen throughout Acts. The Sanhedrin had previously condemned Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>) and had been involved in the persecution of the apostles (<a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-3</a>).<p><b>and said,</b><br>The conspirators directly approached the religious leaders, indicating a level of confidence and shared interest in their plot. This approach suggests that they believed the leaders would be sympathetic to their cause, highlighting the deep-seated opposition to Paul&#8217;s ministry. This mirrors the earlier opposition faced by Jesus, where religious leaders conspired against Him (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath</b><br>The phrase "solemn oath" refers to a vow that was considered binding and sacred. In Jewish culture, oaths were taken very seriously, often invoking God's name as a witness (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). Breaking such an oath was seen as a grave sin. This reflects the intensity of their commitment to stopping Paul, who they saw as a threat to their religious traditions and authority.<p><b>not to eat anything</b><br>Fasting was a common practice in Jewish culture, often associated with prayer and seeking God's favor (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>). However, in this context, the fast is used as a means to demonstrate the seriousness of their vow. This misuse of a religious practice for violent ends highlights the moral and spiritual corruption of the conspirators.<p><b>until we have killed Paul.</b><br>The intent to kill Paul underscores the extreme measures his opponents were willing to take to silence him. Paul, a former Pharisee, had become a prominent figure in spreading Christianity, which was seen as a threat to Jewish religious authority. This echoes the earlier attempts on Paul's life (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23-24</a>) and the persecution faced by early Christians. The plot against Paul can be seen as part of the broader spiritual battle depicted in the New Testament, where the forces of darkness oppose the spread of the Gospel (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conspirators.htm">The Conspirators</a></b><br>A group of more than forty Jews who formed a plot to kill Paul.
