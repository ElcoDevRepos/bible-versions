Their mission to Jerusalem was to deliver aid to the believers there, as mentioned in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>. This mission was a response to a prophecy by Agabus about a severe famine. The fulfillment of this mission demonstrates the early church's commitment to supporting one another, reflecting the unity and love that Jesus taught. Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the early Christian movement, making it a significant location for their mission.<p><b>they returned</b><br>The return of Barnabas and Saul marks the completion of their task and their readiness to continue their ministry. This return signifies a transition in their missionary journey, as they would soon embark on further travels to spread the Gospel. Their return also highlights the importance of accountability and reporting back to the sending church, a practice that is still valued in missionary work today.<p><b>bringing with them John, also called Mark</b><br>John Mark, often referred to simply as Mark, was a relative of Barnabas (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>) and is traditionally believed to be the author of the Gospel of Mark. His inclusion in their return journey indicates his growing involvement in the ministry. Mark's dual name reflects the common practice of Jews in the Roman Empire having both a Hebrew and a Roman name. This practice facilitated their interaction within the diverse cultural settings of the time. Mark's later departure from Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journey (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>) and subsequent reconciliation with Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>) illustrate themes of conflict and forgiveness within the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of new believers.

The fact here stated of their taking John Mark with them, is very interesting in connection with ver. 12. Whether or no Saul and Barnabas were in the house of Mary at the time of Peter's deliverance from prison, they evidently went there shortly before or shortly after. As regards the sequence of events related in this chapter, it is by no means necessary to suppose that Barnabas and Saul did not leave Jerusalem till after the death of Agrippa. Luke, connecting the death of Agrippa with his murder of James and his intended murder of Peter, as Eusebius and Chrysostom and others rightly say, would naturally follow up the narrative of the persecution by the narrative of the persecutor's awful death; and then go on to relate the return of the two apostles to Antioch in continuation of <a href="/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. We have no means of deciding whether, in point of fact, they returned before or after Agrippa's death. It seems most probable that they returned before, as, under the circumstances, they would not tarry at Jerusalem longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of their ministration. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Barnabas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#914;&#945;&#961;&#957;&#940;&#946;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Barnabas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_921.htm">Strong's 921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Chaldee origin; son of Nabas; Barnabas, an Israelite.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Saulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4569.htm">Strong's 4569: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul, the apostle.
