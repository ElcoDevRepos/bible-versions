The province of Asia, a Roman administrative region in what is now western Turkey, included cities like Ephesus and Smyrna. The Spirit's prevention here indicates a strategic divine plan, as Paul would later return to Asia (<a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>) and establish a strong church in Ephesus. This moment highlights the importance of divine timing and obedience to God's leading, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the Israelites' journey in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/9-18.htm">Numbers 9:18-23</a>).<p><b>they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia</b><br>Phrygia and Galatia were regions in Asia Minor, with Galatia being a Roman province inhabited by Celtic tribes. This journey reflects the missionary strategy of reaching key urban centers and then spreading the Gospel outward. Paul's travels through these regions are significant as they later became the recipients of the Epistle to the Galatians, addressing issues of faith, law, and Christian freedom.

The former name was used with an ethnological rather than a political significance, and did not, at this period, designate a Roman province. It does not possess any special points of interest in connection with St. Paul's work, except as including the churches of the valley of the Lycus, Colossae, Laodicea, and Thyatira, but the latter was the scene of some of his most important labours. The province, named after the Galatae, or Gauls, who had poured over Greece and Asia Minor in the third century B. 100, as they had done over Italy in the fourth, and to whom it had been assigned by Attalus I., King of Pergamus, had been conquered by the Romans under Manlius (the name appearing a second time in connection with a victory over the Gallic races) in B.C. 189; and under Augustus it had been constituted as a Roman province. The inhabitants spoke a Keltic dialect, like that which the people of the same race spoke in the fourth century after Christ, on the banks of the Moselle, and retained all the distinctive quickness of emotion and liability to sudden change which characterised the Keltic temperament. They had adopted the religion of the Phrygians, who had previously inhabited the region, and that religion consisted mainly in a wild orgiastic worship of the great Earth-goddess Cybele, in whose temples were found the Eunuch-priests, who thus consecrated themselves to her service. (See Note on <a href="/galatians/5-12.htm" title="I would they were even cut off which trouble you.">Galatians 5:12</a>.) The chief seat of this worship was at Pessinus. The incidental reference to this journey in <a href="/context/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13-15</a>, enables us to fill up St. Luke's outline. St. Paul seems to have been detained in Galatia by severe illness, probably by one of the attacks of acute pain in the nerves of the eye in which many writers have seen an explanation of the mysterious "thorn in the flesh" of <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>, which led to his giving a longer time to his missionary work there than he had at first intended. In this illness the Galatians had shown themselves singularly devoted to him. They had received him "as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus." They had not shrunk from what would seem to have been repulsive in the malady from which he suffered; they would have "plucked out their own eyes," had it been possible, and given them to replace those which were to him the cause of so much suffering. Then they thought it their highest "blessedness" to have had such a one among them. If the memory of that reception made his sorrow all the more bitter when, in after years, they fell away from their first love, it must at the time have been among the most cheering seasons of the Apostle's life.<p><span class= "bld">Were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.</span>--It is obviously implied in this that their own plans would have led them to turn their steps to the region from which they were thus turned. The pro-consular province of Asia, with its teeming cities, like Ephesus, Smyrna, and Sardis, its large Jewish population, its great centres of idolatrous worship, was naturally attractive to one who was seeking with all his energy a rapid expansion of the kingdom of his Lord. But in ways which we are not told, by inner promptings, or by visions of the night, or by the inspired utterances of those among their converts who had received the gift of prophecy, as afterwards in <a href="/acts/21-4.htm" title="And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:4</a>, they were led on, step by step, towards the north-western coast, not seeing their way clearly as yet to the next stage of their labours. Their route through the "Galatian region" (the phrase, perhaps, indicates a wider range of country than the Roman province of that name) must have taken them through Pessinus, the great centre of the worship of Cybele, and Ancyra, famous for its goat's-hair manufactures, and for the great historical marble tablets which Augustus had erected there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- And they went</span> for <span class="accented">now when they had gone</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">through the region of Phrygia and Galatia</span> for <span class="accented">throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">having been</span> for <span class="accented">and were</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">speak</span> for <span class="accented">preach</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The region of Phrygia and Galatia</span>.

Even if the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> is properly omitted, as in the R.T., before <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, the passage must equally be construed as in the A.V. The Galatians were Celts, the descendants of those Gauls who invaded Asia in the <span class="date">third century B.C.</span> This passage seems to show conclusively that Derbe and Lystra and Iconium were not comprehended by St. Paul under Galatia, and were not the Churches to whom the Epistle to the Galatians was addressed; and forcibly suggest that the Galatian Churches were founded by St. Paul in the course of the visit here so briefly mentioned by St. Luke. Asia is here used in its restricted sense of that district on the western coast of Asia Minor, of which Ephesus was the capital. It is in this sense that it is used also in <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>; <a href="/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>; <a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>, etc.; <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. St. Paul apparently wished to go to Ephesus. But the time was not yet come. It was the purpose of the Holy Ghost that the Galatian Churches should be founded first, and then the Churches of Macedonia and Achaia. The apostles were <span class="accented">sent</span>, did not go anywhere of their own accord (comp. <a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5, 6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/16-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{After] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
