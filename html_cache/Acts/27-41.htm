The ship, caught in a violent storm, hits a sandbar, a submerged ridge of sand or sediment. This geographical feature is common in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly near the island of Malta, where this event is believed to have occurred. The ship's grounding fulfills the prophecy given by Paul earlier in <a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-26</a>, where he assured the crew that they would run aground on some island but all lives would be spared. This incident highlights the sovereignty of God in guiding the events according to His divine plan, despite human efforts and natural obstacles.<p><b>The bow stuck fast and would not move,</b><br>The bow, or the front part of the ship, becomes immovable, symbolizing the futility of human efforts against the forces of nature. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual truths, where human strength and wisdom are insufficient without divine intervention. The immobility of the bow also emphasizes the accuracy of Paul's earlier prophecy, reinforcing the reliability of God's word. This situation mirrors other biblical instances where God demonstrates His power over nature, such as Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.<p><b>and the stern was being broken up by the pounding of the waves.</b><br>The stern, or the rear part of the ship, is destroyed by the relentless force of the waves. This destruction signifies the severity of the storm and the peril faced by those aboard. Historically, shipwrecks were common in ancient maritime travel, and this account provides a vivid depiction of such an event. The breaking of the ship can be seen as a type of judgment, where the old is destroyed to bring about a new beginning, much like the flood in Genesis or the refining fire in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>.

At the west end of St. Paul's Bay lies the island of Salmonetta. From their place of anchorage the crew could not have seen that it was an island, and in trying to run the ship on the beach they grounded on a mud-bank between the small island and the coast. The waves swept round the island and met on the bank, and the position of the ship was accordingly one of extreme danger, the prow imbedded in the mud, the stern exposed to the billows.<p><span class= "bld">The hinder part was broken.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was</span> <span class= "ital">being broken up, </span>the tense expressing continuous action.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="accented">But lighting upon</span> for <span class="accented">and falling taro</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">vessel</span> for <span class="accented">ship</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fore-ship for forepart</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">struck</span> for <span class="accented">stuck fast</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">stern</span> for <span class="accented">hinder part</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">began to break up</span> for <span class="accented">was broken with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Where two seas met</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, only here, and in Dion Chrysostomus. The explanation of this "place where two seas met" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (<span class="accented">Ras el-Kaura</span>) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, <span class="cmt_word">they ran the vessel aground</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> has exactly the same meaning. The simple verbs <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> are also both in use for running a ship to land. <span class="cmt_word">The foreship struck</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, here only in the Bible, but very common in classical Greek. Its meaning here is not very different from its frequent medical meaning of a disease "fixing <span class="accented">itself"</span> and "settling" in some particular part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Remained unmovable</span>. "A ship impelled by the force of a gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in Admiral Smyth's chart of St. Paul's Bay, would strike a bottom of mud graduating into tenacious clay, into which the forepart would fix itself and be held fast, whilst the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" (Smith, p. 144).
