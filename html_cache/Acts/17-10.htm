Paul and Silas were in Thessalonica, where their preaching had caused an uproar. The cover of night suggests a need for protection from potential harm, reflecting the early church's challenges and the opposition faced by the apostles. This urgency is reminiscent of other biblical instances where night travel was used for safety, such as the Israelites' departure from Egypt.<p><b>the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea</b><br>The "brothers" refers to fellow believers, highlighting the early Christian community's solidarity and support. Berea was about 50 miles southwest of Thessalonica, a journey that would have taken considerable time and effort. This move demonstrates strategic thinking in spreading the Gospel, as Berea was a less hostile environment. The act of sending them away also reflects the protective measures taken by the early church to ensure the safety and continued ministry of its leaders.<p><b>On arriving there</b><br>This phrase marks the transition from Thessalonica to Berea, indicating the apostles' commitment to their mission despite adversity. It underscores the itinerant nature of Paul's ministry, as he traveled extensively to spread the Gospel. The journey itself would have been arduous, reflecting the dedication and perseverance required in apostolic ministry.<p><b>they went into the Jewish synagogue</b><br>Paul's custom was to begin his ministry in a new city by preaching in the synagogue, as seen throughout Acts. This approach was strategic, as synagogues were centers of learning and discussion, and Paul could engage with Jews and God-fearing Gentiles familiar with the Scriptures. This method also fulfilled the principle of "to the Jew first," as seen in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>. The synagogue setting provided a platform for Paul to connect the Old Testament prophecies with the life and work of Jesus Christ, presenting Him as the fulfillment of Messianic expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.
