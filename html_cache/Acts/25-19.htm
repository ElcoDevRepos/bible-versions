The Jewish leaders were primarily concerned with religious disputes rather than civil or criminal charges. This reflects the broader context of Acts, where Paul often faced opposition from Jewish authorities who saw his teachings as a threat to their traditions. The term "contentions" suggests ongoing disputes, indicating that these were not new issues but part of a larger pattern of conflict between early Christians and Jewish leaders. This mirrors earlier conflicts in Acts, such as those in <a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12-17</a>, where Paul faced similar accusations.<p><b>and a certain Jesus who had died</b><br>The mention of Jesus as "a certain Jesus who had died" underscores the centrality of Jesus' death in the Christian message. This reflects the historical reality of Jesus' crucifixion, a well-documented event in the Gospels and corroborated by external sources like Tacitus and Josephus. The phrasing indicates that Jesus was a known figure, yet the Jewish leaders did not accept His resurrection, which was a cornerstone of Paul's preaching. This contention over Jesus' death and resurrection is a recurring theme in Acts, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23-24</a> and <a href="/acts/13-28.htm">Acts 13:28-30</a>.<p><b>but whom Paul affirmed to be alive</b><br>Paul's affirmation of Jesus being alive is a declaration of the resurrection, a foundational doctrine of Christianity. This belief set early Christians apart from other Jewish sects and was a primary reason for the persecution they faced. The resurrection is not only a historical claim but also a theological one, signifying Jesus' victory over death and His divine nature. Paul's insistence on the resurrection is consistent with his writings in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-8</a>, where he outlines the evidence and significance of the resurrection. This claim also fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which Peter cites in <a href="/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a> to argue for the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on trial, accused by Jewish leaders of crimes against their law and the temple.

Festus was speaking to a Jewish king, and would not knowingly have used an offensive term. He falls back, accordingly, upon one which an outsider might use of any local religion which he did not himself accept. What follows shows that he looked on St. Paul as not merely affirming, with other Pharisees, the general doctrine of a resurrection, but as connecting it with the specific witness that Jesus had risen from the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- Religion</span> for <span class="accented">superstition</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">who</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain questions</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); <a href="/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>; <a href="/acts/18-15.htm">Acts 18:15</a>; <a href="/acts/23-29.htm">Acts 23:29</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Religion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); see <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, where there is the same doubt as here whether to take it in a good sense or a bad one.
