The mocking attitude reflects a common human response to the unfamiliar or supernatural, often seen throughout Scripture when God's power is displayed (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-24</a>, where Elisha is mocked). This reaction contrasts with those who were amazed and perplexed, showing the division in response to the Holy Spirit's work. The mockers represent a hardened heart, unwilling to accept the divine explanation for the apostles' behavior.<p><b>and said, &#8220;They are drunk</b><br>The accusation of drunkenness was a dismissive explanation for the apostles' speaking in tongues. In the cultural context of the time, public drunkenness was not uncommon, and attributing unusual behavior to intoxication was a way to undermine the legitimacy of the apostles' message. This reflects a misunderstanding of the spiritual event taking place, as the apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit, not wine. This misunderstanding is addressed by Peter in <a href="/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>, where he clarifies that it is only the third hour of the day, a time when people would not typically be drunk.<p><b>on new wine!&#8221;</b><br>New wine refers to freshly fermented wine, which could be more intoxicating due to its freshness. The mention of new wine is significant because it underscores the mockers' attempt to rationalize the supernatural with a natural explanation. This phrase also serves as a contrast to the "new wine" of the Holy Spirit, which brings about a new covenant and transformation in believers (<a href="/luke/5-37.htm">Luke 5:37-39</a>). The irony is that while the mockers attribute the apostles' behavior to physical intoxication, they are actually witnessing the spiritual "intoxication" of the Holy Spirit's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary group involved in this event, filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking in various tongues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, during the Jewish festival of Pentecost.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mockers.htm">The Mockers</a></b><br>A group of onlookers who dismiss the miraculous event by attributing it to drunkenness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pentecost.htm">Pentecost</a></b><br>A Jewish feast occurring fifty days after Passover, significant for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, whose arrival empowers the apostles to speak in different languages.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>The mockers' reaction shows a lack of spiritual discernment.

The Greek word was sometimes used, like the Latin <span class= "ital">mustum, </span>for the unfermented grape-juice. Here, however, the context shows that wine, in the strict sense of the word, was intended, and the use of the same word in the LXX. of <a href="/job/32-19.htm" title="Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.">Job 32:19</a> confirms this meaning. The word for "new wine" in <a href="/matthew/9-17.htm" title="Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.">Matthew 9:17</a>, <a href="/mark/2-22.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.">Mark 2:22</a>, is different, but there also (see Notes) fermentation is implied. The words, as has been said above (Note on <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>), point to a certain appearance of excitement in tone, manner, and words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - But <span class="accented">others</span> for <span class="accented">others</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">they are filled with</span> for <span class="accented">these men are full of</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>New wine</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">sweet wine.</span> These mockers, men incapable of serious and devout appreciation of the work of the Holy Spirit, attributed the tension of feeling which they saw, and the unintelligible words which they heard, to the effect of wine.
