Jerusalem was the religious and cultural center for Jews, especially during significant feasts like Pentecost. The city was bustling with activity, as Jews from various regions would travel to fulfill religious obligations. This setting is crucial for understanding the events of Pentecost, as it provided a diverse audience for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>God-fearing Jews</b><br>These were devout Jews who adhered to the Law of Moses and participated in Jewish religious practices. The term "God-fearing" often refers to those who were particularly pious and reverent, possibly including proselytes or Gentile converts to Judaism. Their presence in Jerusalem during Pentecost highlights their commitment to their faith and the significance of the festival.<p><b>from every nation under heaven</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the widespread dispersion of Jews across the known world at the time. It reflects the historical context of the Jewish Diaspora, where Jews lived in various regions due to exile and trade. This diversity set the stage for the miraculous event of speaking in tongues, as it allowed the message of the Gospel to be understood by people of different languages and cultures. This moment also fulfills the prophecy of the Gospel reaching all nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a> and foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.

Their residency&#8212;whether permanent or temporary for the feast&#8212;fulfills God&#8217;s design that a ready audience be on hand when the gospel is first preached (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>; <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Three annual feasts required Jewish males to appear in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>), so the city swelled with worshipers who were primed for spiritual truth. Solomon had prayed that foreigners coming to this house would know the Lord&#8217;s great name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-32.htm">2 Chronicles 6:32-33</a>); Pentecost becomes the answer to that centuries-old prayer.<p>&#8226; By pinpointing the location, the text underlines that the promised outpouring (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a>, echoed in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-21</a>) happens in the very city where Jesus was crucified and raised&#8212;highlighting continuity between promise, atonement, and empowerment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God-fearing Jews</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;God-fearing Jews&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>)<p>&#8226; These men revere the Lord; their hearts are already oriented toward obedience (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The Spirit often moves first among those who earnestly seek Him (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their devotion is seen in making the pilgrimage (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>, with the Ethiopian eunuch called &#8220;a God-fearing man&#8221;). Such fear of God sets the stage for repentance when Peter preaches (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Cornelius later receives the gospel as another &#8220;God-fearing&#8221; individual (<a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>), showing that reverence prepares soil for the seed.<p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s choice of words also reassures Jewish readers that Pentecost is not a break with their faith but its fulfillment (<a href="/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From every nation under heaven</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;from every nation under heaven.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>)<p>&#8226; The phrase captures the worldwide dispersion of Jewish people since the exile, now gathered into one place (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). That diversity explains why the crowd later marvels at hearing the mighty works of God &#8220;in our own tongues&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant promise was always global: through Abraham &#8220;all the families of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Pentecost is the hinge where that blessing begins moving outward.<p>&#8226; Jesus had said that &#8220;repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>). Here, the nations come to Jerusalem first, then the church will go out to them (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene prefigures the ultimate gathering John sees&#8212;people &#8220;from every nation, tribe, people, and tongue&#8221; worshiping the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). Pentecost is the first ripple of that eventual tide.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a> shows God&#8217;s perfect timing and placement. Devout Jewish worshipers from across the known world are already in Jerusalem when the Spirit descends. Their reverence makes them receptive; their diverse origins ensure the gospel&#8217;s immediate spread beyond the city. In one verse Luke ties together location, readiness of heart, and worldwide mission&#8212;demonstrating that Pentecost is both the fulfillment of Old Testament promise and the launch pad for Christ&#8217;s global church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">There were dwelling at Jerusalem.</span>--The phrase is one of frequent occurrence in St. Luke's writings (<a href="/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4</a>; <a href="/acts/1-19.htm" title="And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.">Acts 1:19</a>; <a href="/acts/4-16.htm" title="Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.">Acts 4:16</a>).
