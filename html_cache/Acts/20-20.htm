This phrase indicates his courage in the face of opposition, a theme consistent throughout his ministry (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29, 13</a>:46). The Greek word used here implies not hesitating or avoiding due to fear, suggesting Paul's steadfastness in fulfilling his mission despite potential dangers or rejection.<p><b>from declaring anything that was helpful to you</b><br>Paul emphasizes his dedication to teaching what was beneficial for spiritual growth and understanding. This aligns with his pastoral heart, as seen in his letters where he often focuses on edification and encouragement (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). The term "helpful" underscores the practical and transformative nature of his teachings, aiming to equip believers for a life of faith.<p><b>as I taught you publicly</b><br>Paul's public teaching took place in synagogues, marketplaces, and lecture halls (<a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>). This method of teaching was common in the Greco-Roman world, where philosophers and teachers would engage with the public. His public ministry allowed for the dissemination of the Gospel to a broad audience, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and from house to house</b><br>This phrase highlights the early church's practice of meeting in homes, a necessity due to the lack of formal church buildings and the need for intimate fellowship (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>).

In each case he considered what was required by the capacity of his disciples. That of Ephesus was wider than that of Corinth, and there, accordingly, he was able to set forth "the whole counsel of God" (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Publicly, and from house to house.</span>--The first word points probably to the teaching in the synagogue and the lecture-room of Tyrannus (<a href="/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>), the second to the meetings of disciples which were held in private houses, such as that of Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.
