The term "brothers" indicates that Paul is addressing fellow Jews and God-fearing Gentiles in the synagogue of Pisidian Antioch. This setting is significant as it reflects the early Christian mission strategy of reaching out to Jewish communities first. The use of "brothers" also underscores the familial bond and shared heritage between Paul and his audience, which is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant.<p><b>that through Jesus</b><br>This phrase highlights the centrality of Jesus Christ in the message of salvation. Jesus is presented as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. The phrase "through Jesus" indicates that He is the mediator of the new covenant, a role foreshadowed by figures like Moses and David. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are the means by which God's promises are realized, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>the forgiveness of sins</b><br>Forgiveness of sins is a core tenet of the Christian faith, signifying the removal of the barrier between humanity and God. In the Jewish context, forgiveness was traditionally sought through the sacrificial system outlined in the Law of Moses. However, through Jesus, forgiveness is offered once and for all, as He is the ultimate sacrifice. This concept is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>, which speaks of Jesus' sacrifice as sufficient for all time. The forgiveness offered through Jesus is comprehensive, addressing both individual and communal sin.<p><b>is proclaimed to you</b><br>The act of proclamation is central to the apostolic mission. The use of "proclaimed" indicates the authoritative announcement of the gospel message. This proclamation is not just informative but transformative, calling for a response from the hearers. The message of forgiveness through Jesus is not limited to the immediate audience but is intended for all people, fulfilling the Great Commission found in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. The proclamation is an invitation to enter into a new relationship with God, characterized by grace and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is delivering the message in <a href="/bsb/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.
