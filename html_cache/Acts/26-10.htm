Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life, was where Paul, then known as Saul, actively persecuted Christians. His actions were in line with his zealous adherence to Jewish law and tradition, as Jerusalem was the location of the Temple and the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council.<p><b>With authority from the chief priests</b><br>The chief priests were the leading religious authorities in Judaism, responsible for temple rituals and maintaining religious order. Paul's authority from them indicates his high standing and trust within the Jewish religious hierarchy. This authority allowed him to act against Christians, whom the Jewish leaders saw as a threat to their religious traditions and power.<p><b>I put many of the saints in prison</b><br>The term "saints" refers to early Christians, highlighting their set-apart status for God. Paul's imprisonment of them shows the severe persecution the early church faced. This persecution was a fulfillment of Jesus' warnings to His followers about the trials they would endure (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>and when they were condemned to death</b><br>This indicates the severity of the persecution, as some Christians faced capital punishment. The condemnation to death reflects the intense opposition from Jewish authorities who viewed the Christian movement as heretical and dangerous.<p><b>I cast my vote against them</b><br>Paul's vote suggests he was a member of the Sanhedrin or had significant influence in its decisions. His active participation in the condemnation of Christians underscores his former zeal in opposing the early church. This also highlights the radical transformation in Paul's life after his encounter with Christ, as he later became a leading apostle advocating for the faith he once tried to destroy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The apostle recounting his past actions against Christians before his conversion.
