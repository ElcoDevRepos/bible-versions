This moment occurs after Peter's miraculous release from prison, highlighting the divine intervention that often accompanies the early church's mission. The act of following the angel signifies Peter's willingness to be led by God's messenger, reminiscent of the Israelites following the pillar of cloud and fire in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. It also parallels Jesus' call to His disciples to follow Him, as seen in <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>.<p><b>but he was unaware that what the angel was doing was real</b><br>Peter's initial lack of awareness underscores the supernatural nature of the event. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's actions are beyond human comprehension, such as when the disciples did not recognize the resurrected Jesus on the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>). The phrase highlights the theme of divine mystery and the often unseen hand of God at work in believers' lives. It also reflects the human tendency to doubt or misunderstand God's miraculous interventions.<p><b>He thought he was only seeing a vision</b><br>Peter's assumption that he was experiencing a vision rather than reality indicates the common occurrence of visions in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Peter's vision of the clean and unclean animals. Visions were a means through which God communicated His will, as with the prophets in the Old Testament, such as Daniel and Ezekiel. This moment emphasizes the blurred line between spiritual experiences and physical reality in the biblical narrative, reminding believers of the spiritual realm's influence on earthly events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early Christian church.
