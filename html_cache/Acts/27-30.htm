The sailors' attempt to escape reflects their desperation and fear, highlighting the severity of the storm. This act of self-preservation contrasts with Paul's faith and leadership during the crisis. Historically, sailors were often superstitious and might have believed abandoning the ship was their only hope. This moment underscores the tension between human fear and divine providence, as Paul had already assured them of God's promise of safety (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>).<p><b>Pretending to lower anchors from the bow,</b><br>The sailors' pretense indicates deceit, as they were not genuinely trying to stabilize the ship but rather planning their escape. This action can be seen as a lack of trust in God's promise delivered through Paul. The bow, or front of the ship, was a strategic place to lower anchors to steady the vessel, making their actions appear legitimate. This deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals acted out of fear rather than faith, such as Jonah fleeing from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>).<p><b>they let the lifeboat down into the sea.</b><br>The lifeboat, a smaller vessel used for emergencies, symbolizes a false sense of security. By lowering it, the sailors hoped to save themselves, ignoring the collective safety of all aboard. This act can be compared to the futility of relying on human efforts rather than divine intervention, as seen in other biblical narratives like the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The lifeboat's presence also highlights the practical aspects of ancient seafaring, where such boats were essential for survival but not always reliable in severe storms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

Their choice echoes the self-preserving flight of Jonah when he boarded a ship to Tarshish (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>) and contrasts sharply with Paul&#8217;s earlier assurance, &#8220;Not one of you will perish&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; We see the human impulse to abandon responsibility, yet the sovereignty of God remains intact; His promise through Paul will not be thwarted (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pretending to lower anchors from the bow</b><p>&#8226;

Paul had urged everyone to &#8220;keep up your courage&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-25.htm">Acts 27:25</a>), but courage cannot coexist with deceit (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows their pretense to surface so His deliverance will be unmistakably His, not theirs (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They let the lifeboat down into the sea</b><p>&#8226; In a last effort to secure safety on their own terms, the sailors lower the very boat that could have helped all if properly used&#8212;yet selfishness blinds them to communal need (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul immediately acts: &#8220;Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-31.htm">Acts 27:31</a>).

It was easy for the sailors to urge that the ship needed anchors fore as well as aft, and, while pretending to be occupied about this, to lower the boat which they had before hoisted on deck (<a href="/acts/27-16.htm" title="And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:">Acts 27:16</a>), and so effect their escape. The boat, it might appear, was necessary to their alleged purpose, as their ostensible aim was not merely to cast anchors from the bow, but to carry them out (as the word which St. Luke uses implies) to the full tether of the cable's length.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Sailors</span> for <span class="accented">shipmen</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seeking</span> for <span class="accented">about</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and had lowered</span> for <span class="accented">when they had let down</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">lay out</span> for <span class="accented">have east</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had lowered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, see ver. 17, note). The sailors thought the only chance of safety was to get into the boat and run ashore on the beach. They pretended, therefore, that they wished to let down more anchors from the bow; and let down the boat, as if with that intention, being prepared to jump in and make for the shore, leaving the ship to be wrecked, with all on board her. What a contrast to the conduct of our English crews, who are always the last to quit a sinking vessel! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
