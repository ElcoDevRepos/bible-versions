Paul has just delivered a sermon to the Athenians, addressing their altar to an "unknown god" and proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus. The phrase "at that" suggests a conclusion to his discourse, highlighting the immediate reaction of the audience. This moment is significant as it marks the end of Paul's engagement with the intellectual elite of Athens, a city known for its philosophical heritage.<p><b>Paul</b><br>Paul, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, is a central figure in the New Testament. A Pharisee by training, he became a fervent apostle of Christ after his conversion experience on the road to Damascus. His missionary journeys, as recorded in Acts, were instrumental in spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. In this context, Paul is in Athens, a city renowned for its philosophical schools, engaging with both Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>left</b><br>The act of leaving signifies the end of Paul's formal engagement with the Athenians at the Areopagus. This departure can be seen as a strategic move, as Paul often left places where his message was met with resistance or ridicule. It also reflects the itinerant nature of his ministry, as he traveled extensively to preach the Gospel.<p><b>the Areopagus</b><br>The Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill, was a prominent rock outcropping in Athens. It served as the meeting place for the council of elders, which was responsible for overseeing matters of religion and morality. This location is significant because it was a center of philosophical debate and legal proceedings. Paul's presence here underscores the importance of his message, as he was addressing an audience well-versed in Greek philosophy and religion.
