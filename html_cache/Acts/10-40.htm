The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith, affirming Jesus as the Son of God and validating His teachings and sacrifice. The "third day" is significant, fulfilling Jesus' own predictions (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>) and aligning with Jewish understanding of time, where part of a day is considered a whole day. This timing also connects to the prophecy of Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>), which Jesus referenced as a sign of His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).<p><b>and caused Him to be seen&#8212;</b><br>The visibility of the resurrected Christ is crucial for the establishment of the early church's witness. Jesus appeared to many, including the apostles and over 500 others (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>), providing undeniable evidence of His resurrection. This visibility counters any claims that the resurrection was a spiritual or metaphorical event, affirming it as a historical and physical reality. The appearances also fulfilled Jesus' promise to His disciples that they would see Him again (<a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a>), strengthening their faith and empowering them to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who raised Jesus from the dead, demonstrating His power over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage, sharing the gospel with Cornelius and his household.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion who is devout and God-fearing, representing the Gentile inclusion in the early Church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>A significant time marker in Christian theology, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy about His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Centrality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of Christian faith.
