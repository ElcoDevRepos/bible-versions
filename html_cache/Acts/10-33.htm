Cornelius, a Roman centurion, was a God-fearing man who respected Jewish customs and sought to honor God. His immediate action demonstrates his faith and readiness to follow God's guidance. This urgency is reminiscent of other biblical figures who responded promptly to God's call, such as Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>.<p><b>and you were kind enough to come</b><br>Peter's willingness to visit Cornelius, a Gentile, signifies a pivotal moment in the early church. Jewish customs typically prohibited Jews from associating with Gentiles, but Peter's acceptance of the invitation shows the breaking down of these barriers. This act of kindness and obedience to God's vision (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>) highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel message, aligning with Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>Now then, we are all here in the presence of God</b><br>Cornelius acknowledges the gathering as a sacred assembly, recognizing God's presence among them. This reflects the biblical understanding that God is present wherever His people gather in His name (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). The phrase underscores the reverence and expectation of divine revelation, similar to the Israelites' assembly at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>).<p><b>to listen to everything the Lord has instructed you to tell us</b><br>Cornelius and his household are prepared to receive God's message through Peter. This openness to divine instruction is crucial for spiritual growth and transformation. The phrase echoes the prophetic tradition where God's messengers deliver His word to the people (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the covenant community, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, described as a devout and God-fearing man.

His prompt obedience mirrors:<p>&#8226; Abraham heading for Moriah &#8220;early the next morning&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The shepherds hurrying to Bethlehem after the angelic announcement (<a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15-16</a>).<p>Immediate obedience declares trust that God&#8217;s directives are always right and urgent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you were kind enough to come</b><p>Cornelius recognizes Peter&#8217;s willingness to cross cultural lines and physical distance.
