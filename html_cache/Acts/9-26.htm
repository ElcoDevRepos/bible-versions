Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and the early Christian church, is where Saul had previously received authority to persecute Christians (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>). His return to this city as a believer highlights the radical change in his life. This journey also fulfills Jesus' prophecy that Saul would suffer for His name (<a href="/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>).<p><b>he tried to join the disciples</b><br>Saul's attempt to join the disciples indicates his desire to be part of the Christian community and to be accepted as a fellow believer. The term "disciples" refers to the followers of Jesus who were spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. Saul's efforts to join them demonstrate his commitment to his new faith and his recognition of the importance of fellowship among believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p><b>but they were all afraid of him</b><br>The disciples' fear of Saul is understandable given his past as a fierce persecutor of Christians. Saul had been present at the stoning of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>) and had actively sought to imprison believers (<a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>). Their fear reflects the human tendency to be cautious and skeptical, especially when faced with someone who has caused great harm.<p><b>not believing that he was a disciple</b><br>The disciples' disbelief in Saul's conversion underscores the dramatic nature of his transformation. It also highlights the challenge of accepting that someone with a notorious past can genuinely change. This skepticism is a common human reaction, yet it contrasts with the Christian call to forgiveness and acceptance of repentant sinners (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). Saul's eventual acceptance by the disciples, facilitated by Barnabas (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>), serves as a powerful example of the transformative power of God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

The verb for "join" is that which is always used of close and intimate fellowship, such as that of husband and wife, of brothers, and of friends. (Comp. <a href="/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm" title="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?">Matthew 19:5</a>; <a href="/luke/15-15.htm" title="And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.">Luke 15:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.">1Corinthians 6:16</a>.) He was seeking, in the language of a later time, full communion with the disciples. It was not strange that his motives should be at first suspected. Might he not be coming to "spy out" their weak places, and in time appear again as a persecutor? The difficulty which at first presents itself in understanding how the Church at Jerusalem could have remained ignorant of what Saul had done at Damascus as a preacher of the faith, is adequately explained by the political incidents to which attention has been already drawn. The occupation of the city by Aretas, and his enmity against the Herodian house, may well have stopped the usual intercourse between it and Jerusalem, then under the rule of Agrippa, and so the reports that reached the Apostles would come in uncertain and fluctuating forms, which were not sufficient to lead the disciples to trust in the conversion of the persecutor. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- He</span> for <span class="accented">Saul</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and they were</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, etc., A.V.; <span class="accented">not believing</span> for <span class="accented">and believed not</span>, A.V. The narrative thus far exactly agrees with <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17, 18</a>, which, however, supplies the motive of the journey to Jerusalem, which is not here mentioned, viz. to see Peter. It seems strange to some commentators that the news of Saul having become a zealous Christian should not have reached Jerusalem after an interval of three years. But first, we do not know. how much of those three years was spent in Arabia, nor how much the unsettled state of Damascus may have interrupted the usual communication between Jerusalem and Damascus, nor how suspicious of evil the poor persecuted disciples at Jerusalem may have been. They knew of the fierceness of Saul's zeal as a persecutor by their own experience; they knew of him as a disciple only by report.
