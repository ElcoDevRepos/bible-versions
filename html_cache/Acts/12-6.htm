The timing is significant, as it was the night before Peter's trial, indicating the urgency and gravity of the situation. Herod's intent to bring Peter to trial reflects the political and religious tensions of the time, as Herod sought to appease Jewish leaders by persecuting Christians. This echoes the trials of Jesus and other apostles, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the early church and Jewish authorities.<p><b>Peter was sleeping between two soldiers</b><br>Peter's ability to sleep in such dire circumstances demonstrates his faith and trust in God. The presence of two soldiers indicates the high level of security, as Peter was considered a significant threat due to his leadership role in the church. This situation parallels the peace Jesus exhibited during the storm (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), showing a deep trust in God's sovereignty.<p><b>bound with two chains</b><br>The use of two chains emphasizes the extreme measures taken to ensure Peter's captivity, reflecting the seriousness with which Herod viewed the threat of the Christian movement. Chains in the Bible often symbolize bondage and oppression, yet they also set the stage for divine intervention, as seen in other instances where God delivers His people from seemingly impossible situations (e.g., Paul and Silas in <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>).<p><b>with sentries standing guard at the entrance to the prison</b><br>The presence of sentries highlights the Roman practice of ensuring maximum security for prisoners, especially those considered high-risk. This detail underscores the human efforts to control and suppress the spread of the Gospel, which are ultimately futile against God's plans. The guards' role also sets the stage for the miraculous nature of Peter's impending escape, demonstrating God's power over human authority and obstacles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early Christian church.
