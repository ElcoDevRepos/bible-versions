Cornelius, though a Gentile, had adopted Israel&#8217;s rhythm of devotion.<p>&#8226; Prayer positions the believer to receive divine guidance; both Cornelius and Peter experience visions in prayer (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; God answers in His timing; Cornelius&#8217; faithful habit of prayer becomes the doorway through which the gospel will enter the Gentile world (cf. <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Suddenly a man in radiant clothing stood before me</b><p>&#8220;Suddenly a man in radiant clothing stood before me.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-30.htm">Acts 10:30</a>)<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;suddenly&#8221; signals supernatural intervention; angels often appear abruptly (cf. <a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>; <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Radiant clothing&#8221; identifies the visitor as an angelic messenger, consistent with earlier descriptions (cf. <a href="/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>; <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God employs angels to direct His servants when pivotal shifts in redemptive history occur&#8212;here, the inclusion of Gentiles (cf. <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s presence authenticates God&#8217;s approval of Cornelius&#8217; prayers and alms (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>), showing that sincere seekers outside Israel&#8217;s covenant are known to the Lord (cf. <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>; <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-30.htm">Acts 10:30</a> reveals Cornelius as a devout Gentile, faithfully praying at a set hour, when God intervenes through an angelic messenger.

Cornelius&#8217; consistent devotion becomes the catalyst for the gospel&#8217;s expansion, demonstrating that God hears and responds to every heart that seeks Him in truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">I was fasting</span> <span class= "bld">until this hour.</span>--The hour is not stated, but the facts of the case imply that it could not have been much before noon, and may have been later. Assuming that Cornelius in his fasts observed the usage of devout Jews, we may think of his vision as having been on the second day of the week, and Peter's on the fifth. It is probable, accordingly, that the meeting in the house of Cornelius took place on the Sabbath. Allowing some hours for the conference, of which we have probably but a condensed report, the outpouring of the Spirit, the subsequent baptism, and the meal which must have followed on it, may have coincided with the beginning of the first day of the week.<p><span class= "bld">In bright clothing.</span>--The phrase is the same as that used by St. James (<a href="/context/acts/2-2.htm" title="And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.">Acts 2:2-3</a>).
