Angels are often messengers of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham and in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> with Mary. The departure of the angel signifies the end of the divine message and the beginning of human action in response to God's directive. This moment marks a transition from divine revelation to human obedience, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>Cornelius called two of his servants</b><br>Cornelius, a centurion, demonstrates leadership and decisiveness by immediately acting on the angel's instructions. His choice to involve his servants reflects the trust and authority he holds within his household. In Roman culture, a centurion was a respected officer, and his actions would have been seen as authoritative. The use of servants also highlights the social structure of the time, where households often included extended family and servants who were integral to daily operations.<p><b>and a devout soldier from among his attendants</b><br>The inclusion of a devout soldier underscores Cornelius's influence and the respect he commanded. This soldier's devoutness suggests that Cornelius's faith impacted those around him, indicating a household that valued piety and reverence for God. The term "devout" connects to <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>, where Cornelius is described as a God-fearing man, showing that his faith was not isolated but shared among his close associates. This mirrors the broader theme of Acts, where the Gospel spreads through personal relationships and networks.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, stationed in Caesarea.

Luke notes the angel&#8217;s departure to spotlight Cornelius&#8217;s swift, practical response to God&#8217;s clear directive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cornelius called two of his servants</b><p>Cornelius involves his own household, echoing the pattern of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a> and Joshua&#8217;s resolve in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>. <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> has already told us his household feared God with him, so these servants were prepared hearts, not mere employees.

It is natural to infer the same of the two slaves to whom their master imparted the vision, which to those who were living as heathens would have seemed strange and unintelligible. It is obvious that all such facts are interesting as throwing light on the character of Cornelius, and showing that, to the extent of his power, he sought to lead those over whom he had any influence to the Truth which he had found precious as leading him to a higher life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- That</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">him</span> for <span class="accented">Cornelius</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Two of his household servants</span> (see <a href="/acts/9-38.htm">Acts 9:38</a>, note).
