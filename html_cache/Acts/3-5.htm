In the context of first-century Jerusalem, beggars often sat at the temple gates, relying on alms from worshippers. The man's attention indicates a moment of hope and anticipation. Biblically, giving attention is often a precursor to receiving divine revelation or blessing, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>, where believers are urged to pay attention to wisdom. This moment foreshadows the miraculous healing that is about to occur, emphasizing the importance of being attentive to God's messengers.<p><b>expecting to receive something from them</b><br>The beggar's expectation was likely for money, as almsgiving was a common practice in Jewish culture, rooted in the Torah's teachings on charity (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). However, this expectation sets the stage for a deeper spiritual lesson. The man anticipates a material gift, but instead, he receives a miraculous healing, illustrating the theme that God's provision often exceeds human expectations. This reflects <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, where God is described as able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine. The beggar's expectation also serves as a metaphor for the broader human condition, where people often seek temporary solutions, but God offers eternal transformation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his boldness and leadership in the early church.

His entire life experience had trained him to look to human charity, not divine intervention.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s work begins with real people in real need; Scripture never treats suffering as abstract (cf. <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>, where another man born blind becomes the stage for God&#8217;s glory).<p>&#8226; By identifying him simply as &#8220;the man,&#8221; the text invites any reader who has an ingrained weakness&#8212;physical, emotional, or spiritual&#8212;to see himself in the narrative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gave them his attention</b><p>&#8226; Attention is the first step of faith. Just as <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> urges us to be &#8220;fixing our eyes on Jesus,&#8221; this man fixes his eyes on Peter and John, the appointed witnesses of Christ.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49-50</a> the blind beggar Bartimaeus springs up when Jesus calls; the same attentive posture precedes his healing.<p>&#8226; Giving attention also signals willingness to receive instruction. <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a> says, &#8220;My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings&#8221;.

God denies lesser gifts to supply the greater&#8212;healing and salvation.<p>&#8226; The contrast between temporal alms and eternal blessing echoes <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1-3</a>, where the Lord invites the thirsty to receive what money cannot buy.<p>&#8226; Expectation itself is commended; <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-7</a> warns that doubters &#8220;should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.&#8221; Faith-filled expectancy opens the door for God&#8217;s power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/3-5.htm">Acts 3:5</a> spotlights the readiness of a needy man, the focus of faith, and the hopeful expectancy that precedes God&#8217;s intervention.
