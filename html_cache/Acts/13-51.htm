When Jews returned to Israel from Gentile lands, they would shake the dust from their feet to avoid bringing pagan influences into their homeland. In this context, Paul and Barnabas use the gesture to signify a break from those who rejected their message, treating them as outsiders to the covenant community. This act is a form of protest and a declaration of innocence, indicating that they have fulfilled their duty to preach the gospel, and any rejection is on the hearers. This gesture is also mentioned in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>) when Jesus instructs His disciples to do the same if a town does not welcome them, emphasizing the seriousness of rejecting the message of the Kingdom.<p><b>and went to Iconium</b><br>Iconium was a city in the region of Lycaonia, part of the Roman province of Galatia, located in what is now modern-day Turkey. It was a significant city on the Roman road system, making it a strategic location for spreading the gospel. The move to Iconium indicates the apostles' commitment to their mission, undeterred by opposition. Historically, Iconium was a diverse city with a mix of Greek, Roman, and native Phrygian influences, which would have presented both challenges and opportunities for the spread of Christianity. The apostles' journey to Iconium is part of their first missionary journey, as recorded in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13 and 14</a>, highlighting the expansion of the early church beyond Jewish communities to Gentile regions. This movement also fulfills the mandate given by Jesus in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses "to the ends of the earth."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Early Christian missionaries and apostles who were spreading the Gospel message.

Even fresh opposition there (<a href="/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>) could not thwart God&#8217;s purpose; later Paul would remind Timothy of &#8220;the persecutions I endured at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra&#8212;and the Lord rescued me from all of them&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a> captures a decisive moment of obedient faith. Paul and Barnabas, facing rejection, performed the very act Jesus prescribed&#8212;shaking the dust from their feet&#8212;to declare freedom from culpability and to warn their hearers. Then, refusing to be stalled by hostility, they pressed on to Iconium, proving that the gospel&#8217;s advance never rests on human approval but on divine calling and perseverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">They shook off the dust of their feet against them.</span>--The act was one of literal obedience to our Lord's commands (see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-14.htm" title="And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.">Matthew 10:14</a>), and may fairly be regarded as evidence that that command had come to the knowledge of Paul and Barnabas as well as of the Twelve. It was in itself, however, the language of a natural symbolism which every Jew would understand, a declaration that not the heathen, but the unbelieving and malignant Jews, were those who made the very dust on which they trod common and unclean.<p><span class= "bld">And came unto Iconium.</span>--The journey to Iconium is passed over rapidly, and we may infer that it presented no opportunities for mission work. That city lay on the road between Antioch and Derbe at a distance of ninety miles south-east from the former city, and forty north-west from the latter. When the travellers arrived there they found what they probably had not met with on their route--a synagogue, which indicated the presence of a Jewish population, on whom they could begin to work. The city, which from its size and stateliness has been called the Damascus of Lycaonia, was famous in the early Apocryphal Christian writings as the scene of the intercourse between St. Paul and his convert Thekla. In the middle ages it rose to importance as the capital of the Seljukian sultans, and, under the slightly altered name of <span class= "ital">Konieh, </span>is still a flourishing city. By some ancient writers it was assigned to Phrygia, by others to Lycaonia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shook off the dust</span>, etc.; according to the Lord's injunction (<a href="/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>; comp. <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And came into Iconium</span>; a distance of about sixty miles south-east, a five days' journey (Renan). Iconium lay on the high road from Antioch in Syria to Ephesus. It is now called <span class="accented">Cogni</span>, and has a population of nearly thirty thousand souls. Iconium is assigned by Xenophon to Phrygia; by others to Pisidia; and again by others (Cicero, Strabo, etc.) to Lyeaonia. At this time it was the capital of a separate tetrarchy (Lewin, 'Saint Paul'), but Renan calls it" the capital of Lycaonia" ('Saint Paul,' p. 41). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they shook</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ektinaxamenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1621.htm">Strong's 1621: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shake off; mid: I shake off from myself.
