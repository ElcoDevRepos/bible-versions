It reflects the accusation made by a fellow Hebrew when Moses intervened in a dispute. The question highlights the tension and mistrust among the Israelites during their time in Egypt. It also foreshadows the rejection of Moses as a leader, paralleling the rejection of Jesus by the Jewish leaders. This rejection theme is a recurring motif in the Bible, seen in the lives of Joseph, David, and ultimately Jesus Christ.<p><b>as you killed the Egyptian</b><br>This refers to the incident where Moses killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave. This act of violence was Moses' first recorded attempt to deliver his people, though it was done in his own strength and timing. It underscores Moses' initial misunderstanding of his role as a deliverer, which would later be fulfilled according to God's plan. The act also sets the stage for Moses' flight to Midian, where he would spend 40 years in preparation for his divine mission. This mirrors the concept of divine timing and preparation seen throughout Scripture, such as in the life of Jesus, who waited until the appointed time to begin His ministry.<p><b>yesterday?</b><br>The mention of "yesterday" emphasizes the immediacy and recentness of Moses' action, indicating that the news of the killing spread quickly among the Hebrews. It also suggests the rapidity with which Moses' attempt to help was misunderstood and rejected. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human impatience and misunderstanding of God's timing and methods. The quick spread of information among the Israelites in Egypt can be compared to the rapid dissemination of news in the early church, as seen in Acts, where the message of the Gospel spread quickly despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, known for his wisdom and filled with the Holy Spirit.
