The position of the Apostles, though in some degree analogous in their relation to the elders to the later office of bishops, was yet in many ways unique. They had no local diocese, but remained at Jerusalem, guiding the progress of the Church at large, as a kind of central council, calling in the "elders," or "presbyters," to consult with them, and submitting the result of their deliberations to the Church at large.
