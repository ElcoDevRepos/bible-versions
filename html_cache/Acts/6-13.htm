The act of presenting false witnesses echoes the trial of Jesus, where false testimony was also used (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>). This reflects a pattern of opposition faced by early Christians, as false witnesses were often used to discredit and accuse them unjustly. The commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>) highlights the gravity of this sin, showing the moral corruption of those opposing Stephen.<p><b>who said, &#8220;This man never stops speaking</b><br>Stephen was known for his bold proclamation of the Gospel. His continuous speaking indicates his dedication and the persistent nature of his ministry. This phrase suggests that Stephen's message was consistent and unwavering, much like the apostles who were commanded to preach without ceasing (<a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>). It also reflects the early church's commitment to spreading the message of Jesus Christ despite opposition.<p><b>against this holy place</b><br>The "holy place" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central symbol of Jewish worship and identity. Accusations against the temple were serious, as it was considered the dwelling place of God among His people. Stephen's teachings likely included the idea that Jesus had fulfilled the temple's purpose, a theme echoed in Jesus' own words about the destruction and rebuilding of the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). This accusation reflects the tension between the old covenant centered on the temple and the new covenant established through Christ.<p><b>and against the law.</b><br>The law, or Torah, was foundational to Jewish life and religion. Accusations of speaking against the law were tantamount to blasphemy. Stephen, like Jesus, was accused of undermining the law, though he was actually pointing to its fulfillment in Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). This reflects the early church's struggle to articulate the relationship between the law and the Gospel, a theme Paul addresses extensively in his letters (<a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a>). The accusation underscores the radical nature of the Gospel message and its challenge to traditional Jewish beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, chosen as one of the seven deacons to serve the early church.

Like the council that sought false testimony against Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-60</a>), these men valued their institution over truth. <a href="/proverbs/19-5.htm">Proverbs 19:5</a> warns, &#8220;A false witness will not go unpunished,&#8221; yet they preferred lying lips to honest examination of Stephen&#8217;s message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Who said"</b><p>The phrase highlights that the accusers had to manufacture words. Rather than addressing what Stephen actually taught (<a href="/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a>, <a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>), they engineered a narrative. <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a> captures this moment well: &#8220;For false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.&#8221; The Sanhedrin heard not the voice of a faithful preacher but the scripted lines of deceptive spokesmen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"This man never stops speaking"</b><p>The complaint assumes persistence&#8212;as though Stephen&#8217;s continual testimony were criminal. Yet Acts repeatedly celebrates Spirit-empowered boldness (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>; 5:42). Faithfulness to Christ is not an occasional hobby; it is a lifelong calling (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>). Far from being a fault, Stephen&#8217;s &#8220;never-ending&#8221; witness fulfilled the Great Commission&#8217;s command to make disciples &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Against this holy place"</b><p>Calling the temple &#8220;this holy place&#8221; reveals the heart of the charge: Stephen supposedly demeaned the very center of Israel&#8217;s worship. But Scripture shows that God&#8217;s presence is not confined to stone walls (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>). Stephen will soon remind them that God met Abraham in Mesopotamia and Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2, 30</a>-33). Jesus had already predicted the temple&#8217;s destruction (<a href="/mark/13-1.htm">Mark 13:1-2</a>), so Stephen&#8217;s view aligns with prophetic truth, not blasphemy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"And against the law"</b><p>They accuse Stephen of despising Moses, yet he loves the law enough to proclaim its fulfillment in Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). Paul later clarifies, &#8220;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>). By rejecting that fulfillment, the council, not Stephen, stands &#8220;against the law&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13</a> exposes a courtroom turned upside down: liars pose as truth-tellers, while the genuine servant of God is branded a rebel. False witnesses allege Stephen&#8217;s persistent preaching maligns the temple and Moses, yet his message actually honors both by pointing to their ultimate purpose in Christ. The verse reminds us that faithfulness to Jesus may invite slander, but God&#8217;s truth endures beyond every fabricated charge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Against this holy place.</span>--The new feature of Stephen's preaching comes into greater prominence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Words</span> for <span class="accented">blasphemous words</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Set up false witnesses</span>.
