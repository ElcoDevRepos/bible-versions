The 450 years likely includes the time of Israel's sojourn in Egypt, the wilderness wanderings, and the conquest of the Promised Land. This timeline aligns with the broader narrative of Israel's history as recounted in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Genesis through Joshua. The number 450 is significant as it underscores God's long-term faithfulness and patience with His people, despite their repeated disobedience. This period is marked by God's covenantal promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and His deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt, which is a type of Christ's deliverance of believers from sin.<p><b>After this, God gave them judges</b><br>The era of the judges was a time when Israel was ruled by leaders raised up by God to deliver them from oppression and lead them back to faithfulness. This period is detailed in the Book of Judges, which describes a cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The judges were not kings but were charismatic leaders who acted as military deliverers and spiritual leaders. This time highlights the need for righteous leadership and foreshadows the coming of a perfect judge and king in Jesus Christ. The judges served as types of Christ, each delivering Israel in a manner that pointed to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus.<p><b>until the time of Samuel the prophet.</b><br>Samuel marks the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. He was the last judge and the first prophet in a new era, anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. Samuel's role as a prophet was crucial in guiding Israel through this transition, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God over the desire for a human king. His life and ministry are recorded in the books of 1 and 2 Samuel. Samuel's prophetic ministry points to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King. Samuel's anointing of David also foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, who would be a descendant of David and fulfill God's promises to establish an everlasting kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and to govern them.

The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s promises are sure, His timing perfect, and His leadership trustworthy from generation to generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">After that he gave unto them judges . . .</span>--The statement in the text, assigning 450 years to the period of the judges, and apparently reckoning that period from the distribution of the conquered territory, is at variance with that in <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1Kings 6:1</a>, which gives 480 years as the period intervening between the Exodus and the building of the temple. The better MSS., however, give a different reading--"He gave their land to them as an inheritance, about 450 years, and after these things he gave unto them judges," the 450 years in this case being referred to the interval between the choice of "our fathers," which may be reckoned from the birth of Isaac (B.C. 1897 according to the received chronology) to the distribution of the conquered country in B.C. 1444. So far as any great discrepancy is concerned, this is a sufficient explanation, but what has been said before as to the general tendency in a discourse of this kind to rest in round numbers, has also to be remembered. (See Note on <a href="/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>.) Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> viii. 3, ? 1) gives 592 years from the Exodus to the building of Solomon's Temple. Of this period sixty-five years were occupied by the wanderings in the wilderness and the conquest under Joshua, eighty-four by the reigns of Saul and David and the first four years of Solomon, leaving 443 years for the period of the Judges. This agrees, it will be seen, sufficiently with the Received text in this passage, but leaves the discrepancy with <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1Kings 6:1</a> unexplained. There would of course, be nothing strange in St. Paul's following the same traditional chronology as Josephus, even where it differed from that of the present Hebrew text of the Old Testament.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[All this took about]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">450 {}</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tetrakosiois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5071.htm">Strong's 5071: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four hundred.
