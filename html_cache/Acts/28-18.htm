In the Roman judicial system, examination was a formal process where the accused was questioned to determine the validity of the charges. Paul, a Roman citizen, was entitled to a fair trial. This examination likely involved Roman officials who were assessing the accusations brought by the Jewish leaders. The process reflects the Roman commitment to legal order, as seen in <a href="/acts/25-16.htm">Acts 25:16</a>, where it is stated that it was not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he faced his accusers.<p><b>and wanted to release me</b><br>The desire to release Paul indicates that the Roman authorities found no substantial evidence against him. This aligns with previous accounts in Acts where Roman officials, such as Gallio in <a href="/acts/18-14.htm">Acts 18:14-16</a> and Festus in <a href="/acts/25-25.htm">Acts 25:25</a>, found no fault in Paul. The Roman legal system was often more just than the local religious courts, which were biased against Paul due to his preaching of the Gospel.<p><b>because there was no basis for a death sentence against me</b><br>This phrase underscores the lack of legal grounds for the death penalty, which the Jewish leaders sought. Under Roman law, capital punishment required clear evidence of a crime deserving such a sentence. Paul's situation echoes that of Jesus Christ, who was also found innocent by Roman authorities (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4, 14</a>-15) yet was crucified due to pressure from Jewish leaders. This highlights the theme of unjust persecution faced by early Christians and the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face trials for His name's sake (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this verse.
