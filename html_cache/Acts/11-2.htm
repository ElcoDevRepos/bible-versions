Jerusalem was the heart of Jewish religious life and the location of the early church's leadership, including the apostles. This journey follows Peter's significant experience with Cornelius, a Gentile, in Caesarea, where he witnessed the Holy Spirit being given to non-Jews. The phrase "went up" is geographically accurate, as Jerusalem is situated on a hill, and travelers would ascend to reach it. This journey also reflects the importance of Jerusalem as a place of accountability and decision-making for the early church.<p><b>the circumcised believers took issue with him</b><br>The "circumcised believers" refers to Jewish Christians who adhered to the traditional Jewish law, including circumcision. Their taking issue with Peter highlights the tension within the early church regarding the inclusion of Gentiles. This group was concerned with maintaining Jewish customs and saw Peter's actions as a potential threat to their identity and religious practices. This moment is pivotal in the early church's struggle to understand the scope of the Gospel and the role of the Law of Moses. It foreshadows the later Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the church would formally address the issue of Gentile conversion and the requirements of the Law. This tension also reflects the broader cultural and religious challenges faced by the early church as it expanded beyond its Jewish roots.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' original twelve apostles, Peter is a central figure in the early church.

From this time forth they are a distinct section, often a distinct party, in the Church, and here we have the first symptom of the line which they were about to take. They contended with Peter (the tense implies continuous or repeated discussion) because he had eaten with those who were uncircumcised, and therefore, from the Jewish point of view, unclean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that were of the circumcision.</span> At first sight this phrase, which was natural enough in <a href="/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>, seems an unnatural one in the then condition of the Church, when all the members of it were "of the circumcision," and there were no Gentile converts at all. But the explanation of it is to be found in the circumstance of St. Luke himself being a Gentile; perhaps also, as Alford suggests, in his use of language suited to the time when he wrote. It is an indication, too, of the purpose of St. Luke in writing his history, viz. to chronicle the progress of Gentile Christianity. Peter, having completed his rounds (<a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a>), returned to Jerusalem, which was still the abode of the apostles. He was, no doubt, anxious to commune with his brother apostles upon the momentous matter of the Gentile converts; but he was at once attacked by the bigotry of the zealous Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
