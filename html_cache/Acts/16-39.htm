The act of coming to appease them indicates a change in attitude, likely due to the realization that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, which made their previous actions illegal. Roman law protected citizens from public beatings and imprisonment without a trial, and violating these rights could have serious repercussions for the magistrates. This reflects the broader theme of justice and the rule of law in the Roman Empire, highlighting the privileges of Roman citizenship. The magistrates' actions can be seen as an attempt to avoid further trouble or punishment from higher authorities.<p><b>and led them out</b><br>The magistrates personally escorting Paul and Silas out of prison signifies a public acknowledgment of their wrongful treatment. This act of leading them out serves as a form of restitution and public vindication. In the cultural context of the time, honor and shame were significant social values, and this gesture was likely intended to restore some honor to Paul and Silas after their public humiliation. This also parallels other biblical instances where God delivers His people from unjust situations, reinforcing the theme of divine justice and protection.<p><b>requesting that they leave the city</b><br>The request for Paul and Silas to leave Philippi reflects the magistrates' desire to maintain peace and order in the city. Their presence had already caused a public uproar, and the magistrates likely wanted to prevent further disturbances. This request can be seen as a pragmatic decision to avoid additional conflict or scrutiny. It also echoes other instances in the New Testament where apostles are asked to leave a city after preaching the gospel, such as in <a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>. This pattern highlights the tension between the spread of Christianity and the existing social and political structures. Despite the request, Paul and Silas's mission in Philippi had already borne fruit, as evidenced by the conversion of Lydia and the Philippian jailer, demonstrating the unstoppable nature of the gospel's advance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Two key figures in the early Christian church, missionaries spreading the Gospel.

Instead of hiding behind their officers, these civic leaders personally showed up at the jail. That step signals how seriously they now took Paul&#8217;s Roman citizenship (compare <a href="/acts/22-29.htm">Acts 22:29</a>).<p>- Their presence fulfills the apostle&#8217;s insistence: &#8220;Let them come themselves and escort us out&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). God turned the tables&#8212;those who had humiliated His servants now stand face-to-face with them.<p>- Throughout Acts, when authorities finally grasp the hand of God on His people, they come in person (<a href="/acts/5-26.htm">Acts 5:26</a>; <a href="/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23</a>). The scene underscores <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>: &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies live at peace with him&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to appease them</b><p>- &#8220;Appease&#8221; shows the rulers&#8217; sudden change from bold accusers to anxious pleaders. They recognize they violated Roman law by flogging citizens without trial (<a href="/acts/16-38.htm">Acts 16:38</a>).<p>- The apology protects them from imperial discipline, but it also vindicates the gospel. Paul and Silas are publicly declared innocent, much like Peter and John earlier (<a href="/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>).<p>- God often uses unjust treatment to open doors for witness and then brings justice in His timing (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/acts/18-14.htm">Acts 18:14&#8211;16</a>). <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> reminds believers to leave room for God&#8217;s wrath; here the Lord moves swiftly, and the city officials hurry to make peace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and led them out</b><p>- The same men who ordered the beating now provide an escort out of the prison. This public act restores Paul and Silas&#8217; reputation before the town.<p>- Similar divine reversals appear when the angel led Peter out of prison (<a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7&#8211;11</a>) and when Joseph was raised from a dungeon to Pharaoh&#8217;s palace (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>).<p>- The escort also comforts the newborn church; the believers see that following Christ is not shameful but honored by God (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>requesting that they leave the city</b><p>- The officials &#8220;requested,&#8221; not commanded. Having lost moral authority, they can only plead.<p>- Their motive is civic peace: they fear more disturbances if Paul stays. Yet this request also protects the church; hostility will now focus on absent missionaries, not on local converts.<p>- Paul and Silas do not leave in haste. They first visit Lydia&#8217;s house to encourage the believers (<a href="/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a>), modeling <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>&#8212;move on when necessary, but strengthen the flock before you go.<p>- The missionaries&#8217; departure does not weaken the work; a thriving church remains (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>). God often spreads the gospel by scattering His servants (<a href="/acts/17-10.htm">Acts 17:10</a>; 8:4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-39.htm">Acts 16:39</a> shows the Lord turning oppression into opportunity. The magistrates come, apologize, escort, and politely ask Paul and Silas to depart. Each phrase reveals God&#8217;s faithfulness: personal vindication for His servants, public credibility for the gospel, and strategic relocation for future ministry. The passage encourages believers to trust God&#8217;s justice, accept His vindication in His timing, and stay ready to move wherever He opens the next door.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- When they had brought them out they asked</span> for <span class="accented">brought them out and desired</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to go away from</span> for <span class="accented">to depart out of</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/16-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(elthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to appease</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(parekalesan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3870.htm">Strong's 3870: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and kaleo; to call near, i.e. Invite, invoke.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
