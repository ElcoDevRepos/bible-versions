Berea was located in Macedonia, and its inhabitants were commended for examining the Scriptures daily. Sopater's presence indicates the spread of the Gospel in Macedonia and the strong ties Paul had with the believers there. His name, meaning "savior of his father," may symbolize the spiritual salvation brought to his family through the Gospel.<p><b>Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica</b><br>Aristarchus is a familiar companion of Paul, mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> and later in <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> as a fellow prisoner and co-worker. Thessalonica was a significant city in Macedonia, and the church there faced persecution, as noted in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>. Secundus, whose name means "second," may imply a position of humility or service. Their inclusion highlights the diverse backgrounds of Paul's companions and the unity of the early church across different regions.<p><b>Gaius from Derbe</b><br>Gaius, from Derbe, a city in the region of Galatia, is possibly the same Gaius mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a>. Derbe was one of the cities Paul visited during his missionary journeys, as recorded in <a href="/acts/14-20.htm">Acts 14:20-21</a>. Gaius's presence underscores the fruit of Paul's earlier missionary efforts and the establishment of a strong Christian community in Galatia.<p><b>Timothy</b><br>Timothy, a well-known associate of Paul, is frequently mentioned throughout the New Testament. He was from Lystra, another city in Galatia, and was the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father (<a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1</a>). Timothy's mixed heritage made him an ideal bridge between Jewish and Gentile believers. Paul considered him a spiritual son, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>, and entrusted him with significant responsibilities in the early church.<p><b>Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia</b><br>Tychicus and Trophimus were both from the Roman province of Asia, which included cities like Ephesus. Tychicus is later mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a> and <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> as a beloved brother and faithful minister. Trophimus is noted in <a href="/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>, where his presence in Jerusalem caused a stir among the Jews.

As they were to go with him to Jerusalem, it was indeed natural they should have gone to the city from which he intended to embark. It is not difficult to discover the reason of their accompanying him. He was carrying up a large sum in trust for the churches of Judaea, and he sought to avoid even the suspicion of the malversations which the tongue of slanderers was so ready to impute to him (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20-21</a>). Representatives were accordingly chosen from the leading churches, who acting, as it were, as auditors of his accounts, would be witnesses that all was right. As regards the individual names, we note as follows: (1) The name of Sopater, or Sosipater, occurs in the inscription on the arch named in the Note on <a href="/acts/17-8.htm" title="And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.">Acts 17:8</a> as belonging to one of the <span class= "ital">politarchs</span> of Thessalonica. (2) Aristarchus had been a fellow-worker with St. Paul at Ephesus, and had been a sufferer in the tumult raised by Demetrius (<a href="/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>). (3) Of Secundus nothing is known, but the name may be compared with Tertius in <a href="/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>, and Quartus in <a href="/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>, as suggesting the probability that all three were sons of a disciple who had adopted this plan of naming his children. The corresponding name of Primus occurs in an inscription from the Catacombs now in the Lateran Museum, as belonging to an exorcist, and might seem, at first, to supply the missing link; but the inscription is probably of later date. In any case, it is a probable inference that the three belonged to the freed-man or slave class, who had no family names; and the Latin form of their names suggests that they had been originally Roman Jews, an inference confirmed by the fact that both Tertius and Quartus send salutations to their brethren in the imperial city (<a href="/context/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22-23</a>). The names Primitivus and Primitiva, which occur both in Christian and Jewish inscriptions in the same Museum, are more or less analogous. (4) Gains of Derbe. The Greek sentence admits of the description being attached to the name of Timotheus which follows; and the fact that a Caius has already appeared in close connection with Aristarchus makes this construction preferable. On this assumption he, too, came from Thessalonica. (See Note on <a href="/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>.) (5) Timotheus. (See Note on <a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>.) (6) Tychicus. The name, which means "fortunate," the Greek equivalent for Felix, was very common among slaves and freed-men. It is found in an inscription in the Lateran Museum from the Cemetery of Priscilla; and in a non-Christian inscription, giving the names of the household of the Emperor Claudius, in the Vatican Museum, as belonging to an architect. The Tychicus of the Acts would seem to have been a disciple from Ephesus, where men of that calling would naturally find an opening. Such vocations tended naturally, as has been said in the Note on <a href="/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>, to become hereditary. (7) Trophimus (= "nursling," or "foster-child" was, again, a name of the same class, almost as common as Onesimus ( = "profitable"). In a very cursory survey of inscriptions from the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> and Catacombs of Rome, I have noted the recurrence of the former four, and of the latter five times Trophimus appears again in <a href="/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>, and is described more definitely as an Ephesian. We find him again in contact with St. Paul towards the close of the Apostle's life, in <a href="/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2Timothy 4:20</a>. That they were seven in number suggests the idea of a reproduction either of the idea of the Seven, who are commonly called Deacons in Acts 6, or of the Roman institution upon which that was probably based. It may be noted here, in addition to what has there been said on the subject, that the well-known pyramidal monument of Caius Cestius, of the time of Augustus, near the Porta Latina at Rome, records that he was one of the <span class= "ital">Septemviri Epulonum</span> there referred to. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">As far as</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Beraea</span> for <span class="accented">Berea</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the son of Pyrrhus is</span> added in the R.T. and R.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Accompanied</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, peculiar to Luke in the New Testament, but common in medical writers. <span class="cmt_word">As far as Asia</span>. If it were merely said, "there accompanied him," it might have been thought, with regard to the Macedonians Sopater, Aristarchus, and Secundus, that they had merely gone as far as their respective cities, Beraea and Thessalonica; it is therefore added (in most manuscripts, though not in B or the Codex Sinaiticus), "as far as Asia."
