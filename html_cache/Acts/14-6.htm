In the context of <a href="/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>, they were in Iconium, where both Jews and Gentiles were divided over their message. The Holy Spirit often provided guidance and protection to the apostles, as seen in other instances in Acts (e.g., <a href="/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24-25</a>). This awareness can be seen as divine intervention, ensuring the continuation of their mission.<p><b>and fled to the Lycaonian cities</b><br>The act of fleeing does not imply cowardice but rather strategic withdrawal to preserve their lives and continue their mission. Jesus instructed His disciples to flee persecution in <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>, emphasizing the importance of spreading the Gospel over martyrdom in certain situations.

In Lystra, Paul would later heal a man lame from birth, leading to both acceptance and misunderstanding of their message (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8-18</a>). Derbe was a city where Paul and Barnabas would find success in preaching the Gospel (<a href="/acts/14-20.htm">Acts 14:20-21</a>). These cities were part of the missionary strategy to reach both Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>and to the surrounding region</b><br>This indicates that Paul and Barnabas did not limit their ministry to major cities but also reached out to the rural areas. The spread of the Gospel to surrounding regions fulfills the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and reflects the inclusive nature of the Christian message.

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm" title="But when they persecute you in this city, flee you into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.">Matthew 10:23</a>.) The direction of the Apostles journey now took them into a wilder and less civilised region. The range of the Taurus cut it off from the more cultivated country of Cilicia and Pisidia. It is described as a dreary plain, bare of trees, destitute of fresh water, and with several salt lakes. So Ovid (<span class= "ital">Metaph.</span> 8:621) speaks of it, as the result of personal observation:<p>"Where men once dwelt a marshy lake is seen,<p>And coots and bitterns haunt the waters green."<p>The very name Lycaonia, interpreted traditionally as <span class= "ital">Wolf-land</span> (the local legend derived it from Lycaon, who had been transformed into a wolf), represented but too faithfully the character of the inhabitants. The travellers were also losing the protection which a Roman citizen might claim in a Roman province, Lycaonia, which had been annexed in A.D. 17 to the Roman province of Galatia, having been assigned by Caligula to Antiochus, King of Commagene. So wild a country was hardly likely to attract Jewish settlers; and there is no trace in St. Luke's narrative of the existence of a synagogue in either of the two cities. For the first time, so far as we know, St. Paul had to begin his work by preaching to the heathen. Even the child of a devout Jewish mother had grown up to manhood uncircumcised (see Note on <a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). Of the two towns named, Lystra was about forty miles to the south-east of Iconium, Derbe about twenty miles further to the east. The former, which lies to the north of a lofty conical mountain, the <span class= "ital">Kara-dagh</span> (=Black Mountain) is now known as <span class= "ital">Bin-bir-Kilisseh, i.e., "</span>the thousand and one churches," from the ruins that abound there. The addition of "the region that lieth round about" suggests the thought that the cities were not large enough to supply a sufficient field of action. The work in the country villages must obviously--even more than in the cities--have been entirely among the Gentiles. Among the converts of this region, and probably of this time, we may note the names of Timotheus of Lystra (see Note on <a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>), and Gaius, or Caius, of Derbe (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> <span class="accented">Became aware</span> for <span class="accented">were ware</span>, A.V.

Lystra and Derbe were cities of southern Lycaonia, obscure and remote from civilization, situated north of Mount Taurus, in a cold arid country somewhere between <span class="accented">Ak Ghieul</span> on the north, and the volcanic region of <span class="accented">Karadagh</span> on the south. They seem to have been included at this time in the dominions of Antiochus, king of Commagene (Lewin). Lystra is thought to be now represented by <span class="accented">Bin-bir Kilissete</span> (the thousand and one churches) (Lewin and Renan), though this is doubtful; and Derbe distant about twenty miles from Lystra, and the capital of that part of Lycaonia called Isaurica, is thought to be the modern <span class="accented">Dioli</span> (Hamilton, Renan, etc.); others, however, place it nearer the White Lake, <span class="accented">Ak Ghieul</span>, where the ruins of an ancient town are found. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">they found out about it</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(synidontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4894.htm">Strong's 4894: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, consider, be privy to. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fled</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katephygon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2703.htm">Strong's 2703: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and pheugo; to flee down.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
