It was the port from which Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). In <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>, the miracle of raising Tabitha (Dorcas) from the dead by Peter became widely known in this city. The spread of this news highlights the early church's reliance on signs and wonders to authenticate the message of the Gospel. The miracle served as a testament to the power of God working through the apostles, reinforcing the truth of the resurrection and the authority of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and many people believed in the Lord</b><br>The phrase indicates a significant turning point for the inhabitants of Joppa. The miracle led to a spiritual awakening, as many turned to faith in Jesus Christ. This reflects the pattern seen throughout Acts, where signs and wonders often lead to conversions (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>, <a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>). The belief in the Lord here is not just intellectual assent but a transformative faith that acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah and Savior. This event also underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that His followers would do greater works (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>), as the apostles continued His ministry on earth. The growth of the early church in Joppa is a testament to the power of the Gospel to transcend cultural and religious barriers, drawing people from diverse backgrounds into the faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joppa.htm">Joppa</a></b><br>An ancient port city on the Mediterranean Sea, known today as Jaffa, part of modern-day Tel Aviv.
