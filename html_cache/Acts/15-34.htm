In the context of <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, the Jerusalem Council had just concluded, and a letter was sent to the Gentile believers in Antioch with instructions. The use of "notwithstanding" suggests a deviation from the expected course of action, highlighting Silas's decision to remain in Antioch despite the general movement of others.<p><b>it pleased Silas</b><br>Silas, also known as Silvanus, was a prominent leader in the early church, recognized for his prophetic gifts (<a href="/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>). His decision to stay in Antioch was not out of obligation but personal conviction and satisfaction. This reflects the early church's reliance on the guidance of the Holy Spirit, as leaders like Silas were often led by divine prompting rather than human plans. Silas's role in the church is further emphasized in his later missionary journeys with Paul (<a href="/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>).<p><b>to abide there still</b><br>Antioch was a significant center for early Christianity, known for its diverse congregation of Jews and Gentiles. By choosing to remain, Silas contributed to the strengthening and encouragement of the church there. This decision also set the stage for his future partnership with Paul, as Antioch served as a launching point for missionary activities.

Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, &#8220;leading men among the brothers&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>), carried the council&#8217;s letter back to Antioch. After reading the encouraging letter, the Antioch church &#8220;rejoiced&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-31.htm">Acts 15:31</a>). This is the backdrop for verse 34.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reading <a href="/acts/15-34.htm">Acts 15:34</a></b><p>&#8220;But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why Silas stayed</b><p>Silas chose to remain in Antioch rather than return to Jerusalem with Judas. Several truths shine through:<p>&#8226; Ministry opportunity &#8212; Antioch was a multiethnic, mission-sending hub (<a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>). Staying allowed Silas, a prophet (<a href="/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>), to keep &#8220;encouraging and strengthening the brothers with many words.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Unity and discipleship &#8212; His presence helped cement the council&#8217;s decision, showing continued support from Jerusalem leaders (compare <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal calling &#8212; Like the Spirit who earlier said, &#8220;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>), the Lord now directed Silas to a new season of service in Antioch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prepared for future mission</b><p>Silas&#8217;s decision positioned him for God&#8217;s next assignment:<p>&#8226; When Paul and Barnabas parted ways, &#8220;Paul chose Silas and departed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Silas later endured imprisonment with Paul in Philippi, singing hymns at midnight (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>).<p>&#8226; He co-authored letters such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a> and aided Peter (<a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>).<p>Because Silas remained available, God wove him into wide-reaching gospel work, illustrating <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Encouragement for believers today</b><p>Silas teaches that staying put can be as Spirit-led as going:<p>&#8226; Be attentive to God&#8217;s nudge whether He says &#8220;Go&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>) or &#8220;Remain&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-20.htm">1 Corinthians 7:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in ordinary settings often opens extraordinary doors (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Your choice to serve where you are may ripple across continents and generations, just as Silas&#8217;s did through Europe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reliability of the verse</b><p>Some modern versions place <a href="/acts/15-34.htm">Acts 15:34</a> in a footnote, yet the verse fits seamlessly with Luke&#8217;s Spirit-inspired narrative. The harmony between v. 33 (&#8220;Judas was sent off&#8221;) and v. 40 (&#8220;Paul chose Silas&#8221;) testifies to its authenticity. Just as &#8220;the word of the Lord stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>), so verse 34 securely stands within God&#8217;s preserved Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-34.htm">Acts 15:34</a> tells us that Silas deliberately remained in Antioch after delivering the Jerusalem Council&#8217;s letter. His stay fortified the young church, confirmed the council&#8217;s decision, and readied him for the next missionary thrust alongside Paul. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration, the value of abiding where He places us, and the reliability of every line of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - This verse is omitted in the R.T. and by the best manuscripts and commentators.
