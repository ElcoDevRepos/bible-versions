In the context of ancient maritime practices, securing the lifeboat was crucial during a storm to prevent it from being smashed against the ship or lost at sea. This action demonstrates the crew's preparation and urgency in response to the impending danger.<p><b>the crew used ropes to undergird the ship</b><br>Undergirding, also known as frapping, involved passing ropes or cables under the hull of the ship to hold it together during a storm. This practice was common in ancient seafaring to prevent the ship from breaking apart in rough seas. The use of ropes highlights the severity of the storm and the crew's desperation to maintain the ship's integrity. This action reflects the human effort to preserve life amidst natural chaos, a theme often seen in Scripture where human action and divine providence intersect.<p><b>And fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis</b><br>The Syrtis refers to the dangerous sandbanks off the coast of North Africa, known as the Greater and Lesser Syrtis. These were notorious among ancient sailors for causing shipwrecks. The fear of running aground here indicates the crew's awareness of their geographical location and the perilous nature of these waters. This fear underscores the vulnerability of human endeavors against the forces of nature, a recurring biblical theme that points to the need for divine intervention and guidance.<p><b>they lowered the sea anchor</b><br>Lowering the sea anchor, or "letting down the gear," was a technique used to slow the ship's drift and stabilize it in a storm. This action reflects the crew's attempt to control the ship's movement and avoid being driven into the dangerous sandbars. The sea anchor served as a temporary measure to maintain some level of control, symbolizing human attempts to manage crises with available resources.<p><b>and were driven along</b><br>Despite their efforts, the ship was ultimately at the mercy of the storm, being driven along by the wind and waves. This phrase captures the helplessness of the situation, where human control is limited, and the ship's fate seems uncertain. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for life's trials, where faith and reliance on God become essential as human efforts reach their limits. The narrative of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, including this phrase, illustrates the tension between human agency and divine sovereignty, a central theme in the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported as a prisoner to Rome.

Pulling the dinghy out of the crashing waves took every hand on deck, showing both the fierceness of the storm and the crew&#8217;s resolve to preserve every resource. God had already promised Paul safety (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>), yet His people still act responsibly&#8212;just as Nehemiah prayed and posted guards (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>) and Jesus&#8217; disciples secured their own small boat while following Him (<a href="/mark/4-36.htm">Mark 4:36</a>). The Lord&#8217;s sovereignty never excuses passivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the crew used ropes to undergird the ship</b><p>With the hull creaking, the sailors passed heavy cables under the vessel and cinched them tight. This ancient practice, called &#8220;frapping,&#8221; kept planks from splitting apart. Paul later wrote of being &#8220;shipwrecked three times&#8221; and spending &#8220;a night and a day in the open sea&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>); such measures were common in the brutal Mediterranean. <a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25-27</a> pictures sailors reeling from towering waves, yet learning to &#8220;cry out to the LORD in their trouble.&#8221; Even skilled seamen need divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis</b><p>The Syrtis Banks off North Africa were infamous graveyards for ships, where quicksand-like shoals sucked vessels under. That threat loomed so large that seasoned mariners panicked. Scripture repeatedly shows fear arising when circumstances dwarf human strength&#8212;think of Israel before the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10-12</a>) or the disciples in another storm (<a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a>). Yet each story also reveals God&#8217;s power to deliver, reminding us that fear should drive us toward faith, not despair.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they lowered the sea anchor</b><p>To slow their headlong drift, the crew dropped a &#8220;sea anchor&#8221; (or drift anchor), a weighted drag that kept the bow facing the waves and reduced the risk of broadsiding. <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a> says, &#8220;We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.&#8221; Just as the sailors trusted a physical anchor to steady the ship, believers trust the Lord&#8217;s promises to hold us fast when life&#8217;s gales howl. Jonah&#8217;s crew tried every maritime trick before finally calling on the Maker of the sea (<a href="/jonah/1-13.htm">Jonah 1:13-16</a>); God invites us to cast our anchors in Him first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were driven along</b><p>Despite every precaution, the storm still carried them. <a href="/acts/27-15.htm">Acts 27:15</a> already noted, &#8220;we were driven along,&#8221; and verse 27 will echo the same reality. Sometimes the Lord allows us to be swept where we would never choose, yet always for purposes that ultimately bless (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). Paul&#8217;s forced voyage positioned him to testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>; 28:14-16).

Each step highlights human responsibility set against God&#8217;s overarching control. The sailors did everything possible, yet their fate&#8212;and Paul&#8217;s destiny&#8212;rested in the Lord&#8217;s hands. The verse invites us to labor wisely, trust fully, and remember that even when we feel driven along, our Captain never loses the helm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They used helps, undergirding the ship.</span>--The word "helps" answers to what we should call "precautions," or "remedial measures." The process described, technically known as "frapping," consisted in carrying a strong cable several times round the ship from stem to stern, so as to keep the planks from starting, and guard against the consequent leakage. The practice has always been a common one. Thucydides (i. 29) mentions the Corcyreans as having recourse to it. The Russian ships taken in the Tagus in 1808 were kept together in this manner in consequence of their age and unsound condition (Arnold, on <span class= "ital">Thuc.</span> i. 29). We have probably an allusion to it in the lines of Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 14).<p>"Ac sine funibus,<p>Vix durare carinae,<p>Possint imperiosius<p>quor."<p>["And scarcely can our keels keep sound,<p>E'en with the ropes that gird them round,<p>Against the imperious wave."]<p><span class= "bld">Fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Syrtis.</span> There were two quicksands of this name, the Greater and the Lesser, on the north coast of Africa. The former lay just to the west of Cyrene, the latter further west, and nearer Carthage. St. Luke probably speaks of the Greater. These quicksands were the terror of all Mediterranean sailors (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 16, ? 4). A fine description of them is given by the Evangelist's namesake, Lucan, in his <span class= "ital">Pharsalia</span> (ix. 303-310):<p>"When Nature gave the world its primal form,<p>She left the Syrtes neither sea nor land.<p>There neither sinks the shore and welcomes in . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- And when they had hoisted it up</span> for <span class="accented">which when they had taken up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be cast upon the Syrtis</span> for <span class="accented">fall into the quick-sands</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they lowered the gear</span> for <span class="accented">strake sail</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Helps</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in the New Testament only here and <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; but frequent in medical language, for "bandages, "ligaments," "muscles," and all kinds of supports both artificial and natural, and generally to medical aid. <span class="cmt_word">Undergirding the ship</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the Bible; but found, as well as its derivative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, in classical Greek, in the same sense as it has here.

As regards the nautical sense in which St. Luke here uses the word, Dean Howson, in his excellent chapter (23.) on the 'Navigation and Ships of the Ancients,' writes as follows: - "In consequence of the extreme danger to which the ships of the ancients were exposed from leaking, it was customary to take to sea, as part of their ordinary gear, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, undergirders, which were simply ropes for passing round the hull of the ship, and thus preventing the planks from starting;" and he adds in a note that "within the last twenty years (in 1837) marble tables had been dug up in the Piraeus, containing a list of Athenian ships and an inventory of their tackle, and that they all carried, as part of their "hanging gear," <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Another great ship described by Athenaeus carried twelve such. The operation of undergirding is still occasionally performed, and is called by seamen "frap- ping." The German word is <span class="accented">umgurten</span> (Howson). Among ether recent examples (Howson, p. 33) the <span class="accented">Albion</span> was frapped with iron chains after the battle of Navarino. <span class="cmt_word">Cast upon the Syrtis</span>. The wind was driving them straight toward the Syrtis Major, "the Goodwin Sands of the Mediterranean" (Farrar), and another twenty-four hours of such a gale might bring them there. The Syrtis Major was a wide gulf off the northern coast of Africa, now the Gulf of Sidra, lying between Tunis and Tripoli, considered very dangerous from its rocks and shoals. <span class="accented">Be east upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the classical word (Homer, Herodotus, Euripides) for being driven or thrown ashore, and is used in this sense in vers. 26, 29 of this chapter, and in a slightly different sense in ver. 32. <span class="cmt_word">They lowered the gear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a very common word, variously rendered "goods," "stuff," "vessel," according to the <span class="accented">material</span> to which it is applied (<a href="/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, etc.). In the LXX. it is used of agricultural implements (<a href="/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20, 21</a>), of weapons of hunting (<a href="/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>), of household furniture (<a href="/genesis/31-37.htm">Genesis 31:37</a>), weapons of war (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>), instruments of music (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This is the only passage in the Bible where it is used in its technical sense as a nautical term. In classical Greek, when applied generally to ships, it means the whole tackling, sails, ropes, yards, stores, engines, etc. The meaning, of course, is narrowed when applied to some particular part of the ship. Here, on the whole, it seems to mean the "great yard," or, if that had been already lowered, the heavy "head-gear," ropes, pulleys, and the like, which, under the circumstances, would contribute to make the ship roll and be unsteady. The word rendered "lowered" is <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It is rendered "let down" in <a href="/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>; and ver. 30 of this chapter (A.V.). In the R.V. it is sometimes rendered "let down" and sometimes "lowered." In the LXX. it is used in the sense of "spreading" a sail (<a href="/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>), which would be equivalent to "let down," if the sails were reefed at the top of the mast; and of "letting down" (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The R.V., therefore, is correct. The object of what they did was to enable the ship to go as near the wind as possible, and with as little straining and rolling as possible. The operation is called by sailors "lying to." <span class="cmt_word">Were driven</span> (see ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After hoisting it up,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(arantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_142.htm">Strong's 142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise, lift up, take away, remove. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the crew] used</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#967;&#961;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(echr&#333;nto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5530.htm">Strong's 5530: </a> </span><span class="str2">To use, make use of, deal with, take advantage of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">ropes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#959;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(bo&#275;theiais)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_996.htm">Strong's 996: </a> </span><span class="str2">From boethos; aid; specially, a rope or chain for frapping a vessel.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to undergird</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#950;&#969;&#957;&#957;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hypoz&#333;nnyntes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5269.htm">Strong's 5269: </a> </span><span class="str2">To under-gird, as to strengthen a ship against the waves.
