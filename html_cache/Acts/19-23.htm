It follows Paul's extensive ministry in Ephesus, a major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This timing is crucial as it marks a period of significant growth and influence of the early Christian church, which was beginning to challenge established religious and economic structures.<p><b>there arose a great disturbance</b><br>The "great disturbance" refers to a significant social upheaval. Ephesus was a center of pagan worship and commerce, and the spread of Christianity threatened the local economy, particularly the trade of silver shrines of Artemis. This disturbance highlights the tension between the burgeoning Christian movement and traditional pagan practices. It also underscores the transformative impact of the Gospel, which often led to societal and cultural conflicts.<p><b>about the Way.</b><br>"The Way" is an early term used to describe the Christian faith, emphasizing the path of following Jesus Christ, who declared Himself "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This term reflects the distinct lifestyle and beliefs of early Christians, which set them apart from both Jewish and pagan communities. The use of "the Way" indicates a movement that was not just a set of beliefs but a comprehensive way of life, challenging existing religious and social norms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to the goddess Artemis.

Miraculous healings and the public burning of occult scrolls (<a href="/acts/19-11.htm">Acts 19:11-19</a>) marked a season of remarkable triumph. Just when everything seemed to be advancing smoothly&#8212;echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> that God ordains specific times&#8212;this verse signals a sudden shift.

Paul would later write about wrestling &#8220;against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus had forewarned His followers that the world would hate them just as it hated Him (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>), and Peter wrote that fiery trials should not surprise us (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The economic motives of Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24-27</a>) remind us that &#8220;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>The disturbance therefore exposes both human greed and unseen spiritual opposition, yet God remains sovereign, using even turmoil to advance His plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About the Way</b><p>&#8220;The Way&#8221; is Luke&#8217;s favorite early designation for Christians (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; 19:9; 24:14).<p>&#8226; It underscores a distinctive lifestyle, not merely a set of beliefs&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; own claim, &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling believers &#8220;the Way&#8221; highlights the exclusive path to salvation, provoking those whose livelihoods or idolatry were threatened (<a href="/acts/19-26.htm">Acts 19:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also fulfills Isaiah&#8217;s picture of &#8220;a highway of holiness&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>), now realized in Christ&#8217;s followers walking in His steps (<a href="/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>).<p>Hence the uproar was no random civic spat; it was specifically &#8220;about the Way,&#8221; a clash between the newly revealed kingdom of God and entrenched pagan systems.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a> marks the pivotal moment when a thriving gospel movement in Ephesus met organized, spiritually charged resistance.
