In the early church, disciples faced persecution and needed spiritual resilience. The term "strengthening" implies a process of building up and fortifying faith, akin to Paul's exhortation in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a> to "be strong in the Lord." The focus on the "souls" suggests a deep, internal work, aligning with the biblical emphasis on the heart and spirit as the center of one's relationship with God (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><b>and encouraging them to continue in the faith</b><br>Encouragement was vital for the early Christians who faced external pressures and internal doubts. The apostles' role was to exhort believers to remain steadfast, echoing the call in <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a> to "hold unswervingly to the hope we profess." This encouragement was not merely emotional support but a call to perseverance, reflecting Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a> that "the one who stands firm to the end will be saved."<p><b>&#8220;We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,&#8221; they said.</b><br>This statement acknowledges the reality of suffering in the Christian journey. The phrase "many hardships" encompasses the trials faced by early Christians, including persecution, social ostracism, and spiritual warfare. The necessity of enduring these hardships is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, which speaks of trials producing perseverance. The "kingdom of God" refers to both the present reign of God in believers' lives and the future consummation of His kingdom. This dual aspect of the kingdom is central to Jesus' teaching, as seen in <a href="/luke/17-21.htm">Luke 17:21</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. The apostles' message aligns with the prophetic tradition that suffering precedes glory, a pattern exemplified in the life of Christ (Isaiah 53, <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, known for their missionary journeys and efforts to spread the Gospel.

Paul and Barnabas urged them not just to start well but to finish well (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical ways they would have encouraged:<p>&#8211; Reminding them daily of God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p>&#8211; Highlighting examples of perseverance&#8212;&#8220;I have kept the faith&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Celebrating every evidence of grace so that hope stayed fresh (<a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The faith is a settled body of truth, but it is also a living trust relationship. Encouragement keeps both dimensions vibrant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,&#8221; they said</b><p>&#8226; Suffering is not a detour; it is the normal road for followers of the crucified and risen Lord (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Must&#8221; points to divine necessity, not mere probability. The kingdom is entered through faith alone, yet the path is marked by pressure that refines that faith (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Hardships authenticate the message&#8212;those who preach a cost-free gospel preach another gospel.<p>&#8226; Kingdom entrance here looks ahead to final, consummated glory.

Healthy discipleship still follows this pattern&#8212;building strong hearts in Scripture, cheering one another toward lifelong faithfulness, and facing inevitable trials with the confidence that all who share Christ&#8217;s sufferings will share His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Confirming the souls of the disciples.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">strengthening, </span>so as to avoid the more definite associations connected with the other term. In <a href="/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>, the word is so rendered. It is not the same as that used by later writers for the ecclesiastical rite of Confirmation.<p><span class= "bld">Exhorting them to continue in the faith.</span>--The question meets us whether "faith" is used in its subjective sense, the "feeling of trust," or objectively, as including the main substance of what was believed and taught--"a belief or creed." That the latter meaning had become established a few years after St. Luke wrote, we see in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1Timothy 5:8</a>; Jude <a href="/acts/14-3.htm" title="Long time therefore stayed they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.">Acts 14:3</a>; <a href="/acts/14-20.htm" title="However,, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.">Acts 14:20</a>; and on the whole it seems probable that it is so used here.<p><span class= "bld">And that we must through much tribulation.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">through many tribulations.</span> The use of the first personal pronoun is suggestive. Is St. Luke generalising what he heard from those who had listened to St. Paul, and giving it in their very words? Was he himself one of those listeners? The two had clearly met before we find them both at Troas; and on the supposition suggested in the last question, the apparently casual use of the pronoun would be analogous to what we find afterwards. (See Note on <a href="/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>.) In St. Paul's latest Epistle to the chosen disciple of Lystra we have a touching reproduction of this teaching. He speaks of the afflictions which came on him at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, and adds the general truth that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions" (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhorting</span> for <span class="accented">and exhorting</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through many tribulations we must</span> for <span class="accented">we must through much tribulation</span>, A.V.
