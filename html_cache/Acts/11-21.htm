In biblical context, "the hand of the Lord" often represents God's power and presence actively working in the lives of His people (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Here, it indicates that the success of the early Christians in spreading the Gospel was not due to human effort alone but was a result of God's intervention. This aligns with the broader narrative of Acts, where the Holy Spirit guides and empowers the apostles (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The phrase also echoes Old Testament instances where God's hand led Israel to victory and deliverance, suggesting continuity in God's redemptive work through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and a great number of people believed</b><br>The phrase highlights the effectiveness of the Gospel message when accompanied by divine power. The term "believed" implies more than intellectual assent; it denotes a deep, personal trust in Jesus Christ as Savior. This belief is transformative, leading to a new identity in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The "great number" suggests a significant movement, indicating that the Gospel was breaking cultural and religious barriers, fulfilling Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). This growth is a testament to the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting hearts and drawing people to faith.<p><b>and turned to the Lord</b><br>This phrase emphasizes repentance and conversion, a turning away from sin and a turning towards God. In the cultural context of the early church, this often meant leaving behind pagan practices and idolatry, as well as a reorientation of life priorities. Turning to the Lord involves a commitment to follow Jesus and live according to His teachings (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>). This transformation is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the nations coming to know the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>). It also reflects the early church's mission to spread the Gospel beyond Jewish communities, as seen in the conversion of Gentiles in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10 and 11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_believers.htm">The Early Believers</a></b><br>These were the followers of Jesus who were scattered due to persecution.

It was here that the term "Christian" was first used to describe the followers of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_the_lord.htm">The Hand of the Lord</a></b><br>This phrase signifies God's power and favor.

Whenever Scripture speaks of the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;hand,&#8221; it highlights His power in action&#8212;guiding, protecting, and accomplishing His purposes (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-15.htm">Psalm 118:15-16</a>; <a href="/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>). Here, the same divine strength that split the Red Sea and raised Jesus from the dead is now directing these unnamed believers in Antioch. Their courage, clarity, and fruitfulness flow from God Himself, reminding us that lasting kingdom work is never merely human effort (<a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And a great number of people believed</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand produces measurable results.
