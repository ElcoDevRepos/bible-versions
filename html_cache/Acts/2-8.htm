The crowd consisted of Jews from various regions, each with their own dialects and languages. The question highlights the miraculous nature of the event, as it was unexpected for such a diverse group to understand the apostles without a common language. This moment fulfills Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that the disciples would receive power from the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth.<p><b>hears them</b><br>The ability to hear and understand the apostles speaking in different languages was a supernatural event enabled by the Holy Spirit. This hearing was not just auditory but also comprehensible, indicating a divine intervention that allowed the message of the Gospel to transcend linguistic barriers. This event signifies the reversal of the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where God scattered people by giving them different languages. Here, God unites people through the understanding of the Gospel.<p><b>in his own native language?</b><br>The term "native language" refers to the specific dialect or language spoken by individuals from different regions. This detail emphasizes the personal nature of the miracle, as each person heard the message in the language most familiar to them. This inclusivity underscores the universal scope of the Gospel, intended for all nations and peoples. It also prefigures the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, highlighting the global mission of the

springs from genuine astonishment, just like Nicodemus&#8217; &#8220;How can this be?&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-9.htm">John 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores that the event is supernatural&#8213;no human scheme could produce simultaneous, flawless translations.<p>&#8226; Such divine surprises echo moments when God&#8217;s power leaves observers speechless (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>;
