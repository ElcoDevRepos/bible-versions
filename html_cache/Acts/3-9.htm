His ability to walk was a visible, undeniable miracle. Walking symbolizes restoration and new life, often associated with spiritual renewal in biblical texts. This act fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the lame are said to "leap like a deer," pointing to the messianic age.<p><b>and praising God,</b><br>The healed man's response was to praise God, highlighting the proper reaction to divine intervention. This act of worship underscores the recognition of God's power and mercy. It also serves as a testimony to the people, directing their attention to God as the source of the miracle.

It happened right then in the temple courts, confirming the promise of <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6&#8211;7</a>. Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s works as unfolding before observers in real time&#8212;&#8203;think of <a href="/luke/8-47.htm">Luke 8:47</a>, where the woman with the issue of blood &#8220;declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched Him.&#8221; The timing stresses that God&#8217;s power is immediate and observable, not theoretical.<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s instant awareness parallels <a href="/mark/2-12.htm">Mark 2:12</a>: &#8220;Immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out... and they were all astounded.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;When&#8221; signals fulfillment of prophecy in the present, echoing <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares events &#8220;from the beginning,&#8221; then brings them to pass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the people</b><p>Luke notes that &#8220;all the people&#8221; in the temple saw the miracle, underscoring two truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s works invite public witness (<a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a>; <a href="/acts/4-16.htm">Acts 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; No one could deny the event; even opponents were forced to acknowledge it (<a href="/acts/4-14.htm">Acts 4:14</a>).<p>This phrase reminds us of <a href="/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>: &#8220;Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.&#8221; God moves openly so hearts can respond in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saw him</b><p>Sight turns rumor into reality. The crowd didn&#8217;t just hear about a healing; they observed a formerly lame man now whole. <a href="/john/9-8.htm">John 9:8-9</a> gives a similar scene as neighbors &#8220;saw him &#8212; the one who had been blind.&#8221; Seeing validates testimony and fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>&#8217;s principle of confirmed evidence.<p>Bullet points of impact:<p>&#8226; Visual proof silenced skepticism (<a href="/acts/4-16.htm">Acts 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The healed man became a living illustration of the gospel Peter would soon preach (<a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle authenticated the apostles&#8217; message, just as <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a> says God confirmed it &#8220;by signs and wonders.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Walking</b><p>&#8220;Walking&#8221; shows total restoration, not partial improvement. Centuries earlier <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a> promised, &#8220;Then the lame will leap like a deer.&#8221; Now that prophecy materializes. The verb also signals new freedom&#8212;&#8203;the man can finally enter every part of the temple complex on his own.<p>Consider these walk-related moments:<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8-9</a> &#8212; Jesus told a paralytic, &#8220;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a> &#8212; The risen Christ &#8220;walked along with&#8221; the disciples to Emmaus. Walking often pictures fellowship; here it begins the man&#8217;s fresh journey with God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And praising God</b><p>The healed man&#8217;s first instinct is worship. Physical restoration sparks spiritual celebration, matching <a href="/luke/17-15.htm">Luke 17:15</a> where the cleansed leper &#8220;returned, glorifying God in a loud voice.&#8221; Praise redirects attention from the apostles to the Lord (<a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>). It also fulfills <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>&#8217;s call to &#8220;enter His gates with thanksgiving.&#8221;<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Genuine miracles produce genuine worship, not celebrity culture (<a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11-15</a> contrasts false praise).<p>&#8226; Public praise turns a personal blessing into communal encouragement, leading others to glorify God (<a href="/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/3-9.htm">Acts 3:9</a> shows an immediate, public, undeniable miracle that moved a whole crowd toward awe and opened a door for gospel proclamation. The healed man&#8217;s walking and praising modeled the right response to God&#8217;s power, while the witnesses received living proof that Jesus, though crucified, is alive and still saving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
