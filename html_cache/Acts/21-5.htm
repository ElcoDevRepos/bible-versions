The time spent there was significant for fellowship and spiritual encouragement. The phrase reflects the itinerant nature of Paul's missionary journeys, emphasizing the temporary nature of his visits and the urgency of his mission. This aligns with the broader narrative of Acts, where the spread of the Gospel often required moving from place to place.<p><b>we set out on our journey</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the continuation of Paul's missionary journey. The phrase underscores the commitment to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), as Paul and his companions were dedicated to spreading the Gospel despite the challenges they faced. The journey motif is prevalent in Acts, symbolizing the spread of Christianity from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>All the disciples, with their wives and children</b><br>The inclusion of entire families in this farewell scene illustrates the communal nature of early Christian life. It reflects the strong bonds formed within the Christian community, transcending individual relationships to include entire households. This communal aspect is seen throughout Acts, where believers often gathered in homes (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>) and shared their lives together.<p><b>accompanied us out of the city</b><br>This phrase shows the deep affection and solidarity between Paul and the believers in Tyre. The act of accompanying someone out of the city was a sign of respect and honor in ancient cultures. It also indicates the strong emotional ties and the support network that existed among early Christians, who often faced persecution and hardship.<p><b>and knelt down on the beach to pray with us</b><br>Kneeling is a posture of humility and reverence in prayer, reflecting the seriousness and sincerity of the moment. Praying on the beach signifies the openness and public nature of their faith, unashamed to express their devotion to God. This act of communal prayer is a recurring theme in Acts, where prayer is central to the life and mission of the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). The beach setting also evokes imagery of Jesus' ministry by the Sea of Galilee, drawing a parallel between His work and the ongoing mission of His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_his_companions.htm">Paul and His Companions</a></b><br>Paul, the apostle, is traveling with his companions, continuing his missionary journey.

There is no other example of this use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which always means "to fit out, to equip thoroughly," as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 3. 2:2, where he speaks of soldiers <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> well equipped in all respects; and in the only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs, <a href="/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>, where it is rendered "thoroughly furnished," or "furnished completely." R.V. Hence some would render the passage here "when we had refitted (the ship) during these days." But this is a very harsh construction, and it is better, with the glossaries, lexicons, the Vulgate, and most commentators, to take the word here in the unusual sense of "to complete," applied to time. <span class="accented">The days</span> are the seven days mentioned in ver. 4, which were probably determined by the time it took to unlade the ship and get the new cargo on board. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
