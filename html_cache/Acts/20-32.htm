Paul is addressing the Ephesian elders, entrusting them to God's care as he prepares to leave them. This act of committal is a common biblical theme, seen in Jesus' own words on the cross (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). It emphasizes the belief that God is the ultimate protector and guide for His people.<p><b>and to the word of His grace</b><br>The "word of His grace" refers to the gospel message, which is central to Christian faith. This phrase highlights the transformative power of God's grace, which is not earned but given freely. The concept of grace is foundational in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God. The "word" signifies the message and teachings of Christ, which are the means by which believers grow in faith.<p><b>which can build you up</b><br>This phrase underscores the edifying nature of God's word. The idea of being "built up" is akin to spiritual growth and maturity, a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-13</a>). The metaphor of construction suggests a process of strengthening and establishing believers in their faith, akin to building a strong foundation (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>and give you an inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is rich in biblical tradition, often associated with the promises made to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). In the New Testament, this inheritance is spiritual, referring to eternal life and the kingdom of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). It signifies the believer's future hope and the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<p><b>among all who are sanctified</b><br>Sanctification is the process of being made holy, set apart for God's purposes. This phrase indicates that the inheritance is shared among all believers who are being sanctified. It reflects the communal aspect of the Christian faith, where believers are united in their pursuit of holiness (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The sanctified are those who have been justified by faith and are being transformed into the likeness of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking to the elders of the church in Ephesus.

There is, however, a quasi-personal character ascribed to it, "able to . . . give an inheritance," which suggests the thought of something more than the written or spoken word. The true explanation is probably to be found in the thought of the "engrafted (or better, <span class= "ital">the implanted</span>) word" of <a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">James 1:21</a>, the "word of God, quick and powerful" of <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>; and in so far as this is identical with the "Light that lighteth every man" of <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>, we may find in these passages a preparation for the more fully developed teaching of St. John as to the <span class= "ital">Logos.</span> We cannot pass over the word "build" without noting the recurrence of the same thought and word in <a href="/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20-21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm" title=" Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.">Colossians 2:7</a>.

But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10</a>), but it would gain additional vividness from the stately architecture of Ephesus, perhaps also from the presence of one among St. Paul's companions who may have been himself an architect. (See Note on <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- Now</span> for <span class="accented">now brethren</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the inheritance</span> for <span class="accented">an inheritance</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I commend you to God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). A most beautiful and significant phrase! The apostle is leaving for ever the flock which he had fed with such devoted care and loved with such a fervent love. He was leaving them with a strong impression of the dangers to which they would be exposed. To whom could he entrust them? to what loving hands could he consign them? He gives them to God, to take watchful custody of them. He brings them to him in the prayer of faith. He commits to him the precious deposit (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>), to be preserved safe unto the day of Christ. So the Savior of the world, when dying on the cross, said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit "(<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), and then trustingly gave up the ghost (see too <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). No less beautiful are the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And to the word of his grace</span>. He was thinking of the grievous wolves, and of their pernicious doctrine; of the deceivers that should arise, and their soul-destroying heresies; and so he turns to the one source of safety "the Word of God's grace in Jesus Christ." If they are kept in that Word of truth, if they nourish their souls with that sincere milk, they will be safe. The gospel which he had preached would be their safety unto the end. It would build them up on the one Foundation which never can be moved; it would preserve them holy to take possession of the inheritance of the saints in light. <span class="cmt_word">The inheritance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; and Ephesians 1:11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>.
