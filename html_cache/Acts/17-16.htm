He is waiting for Silas and Timothy, who remained in Berea. Athens, a prominent city in ancient Greece, was known for its rich history in philosophy, art, and politics. It was a center of learning and culture, home to famous philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The city was also a hub for various religious practices and beliefs, which sets the stage for Paul's observations and subsequent actions.<p><b>he was deeply disturbed in his spirit</b><br>Paul's reaction is one of profound spiritual concern. This disturbance reflects his zeal for the glory of God and his distress over the idolatry that pervades the city. His response is reminiscent of the righteous indignation seen in the prophets of the Old Testament, who were often grieved by the idolatry of Israel (e.g., Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>). This phrase indicates an emotional and spiritual response, highlighting Paul's deep commitment to the truth of the Gospel and his desire for people to turn from false gods to the living God.<p><b>to see that the city was full of idols</b><br>Athens was renowned for its numerous temples, altars, and statues dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The city's idolatry was not only a religious practice but also intertwined with its cultural and social identity. The presence of so many idols underscores the spiritual blindness and lostness of the Athenians. This situation echoes the warnings against idolatry found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the futility of idol worship is exposed. Paul's observation sets the stage for his later discourse at the Areopagus, where he addresses the Athenians' religious practices and introduces them to the "unknown God" they ignorantly worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and missionary who is waiting in Athens for his companions, Silas and Timothy.

Seasons of waiting can become windows of ministry when we stay attentive to what the Lord places before us.<p>Helpful takeaways:<p>&#8226; Waiting is not wasted when our hearts stay alert to God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Paul trusted the Lord with the timing of his co-workers&#8217; return (<a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>) while pressing on with the work at hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Athens</b><p>Athens was the cultural hub of the ancient world&#8212;steeped in philosophy, art, and debate. &#8220;All the Athenians and foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing more than hearing and discussing the latest ideas&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-21.htm">Acts 17:21</a>). Yet intellectual brilliance did not translate into spiritual light. Paul&#8217;s presence in this influential city shows how the gospel goes to the centers of thought as well as to small villages (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-24</a>).<p>What we notice:<p>&#8226; A city proud of its wisdom still needed the true wisdom of God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Strategic locations matter; God positions His servants where culture is shaped.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was deeply disturbed in his spirit</b><p>The scene did not merely disappoint Paul; it shook him.

This was the same righteous zeal seen in Jesus: &#8220;Zeal for Your house will consume Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>). His reaction blended holy jealousy for God&#8217;s glory with heartfelt compassion for people trapped in deception (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p>How this looks in us:<p>&#8226; Grief over sin grows out of love for God and love for neighbor.<p>&#8226; A stirred spirit should prompt prayerful, gospel-centered action rather than harsh condemnation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see that the city was full of idols</b><p>Athens was &#8220;full of idols&#8221;&#8212;literally a forest of statues. Paul&#8217;s biblical worldview identified idolatry as spiritual robbery; only the living God deserves worship (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The prophets mocked lifeless images (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>), and Paul echoed that perspective: &#8220;Turn from these worthless things to the living God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>). Later he urged believers, &#8220;Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>). The Thessalonians&#8217; testimony showed the gospel&#8217;s power: they &#8220;turned to God from idols&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>).<p>What Paul saw&#8212;and what we still see today:<p>&#8226; Idolatry is not limited to carved stone; anything capturing the heart above God is an idol (<a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Confronting idolatry begins with proclaiming the sufficiency and supremacy of Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16</a> paints a vivid picture of a servant of God who refuses to be passive. While waiting, Paul surveyed his surroundings, felt a piercing grief over the idolatry he witnessed, and let that holy disturbance propel him into gospel engagement. The verse reminds us that moments of pause are opportunities, that spiritual eyes should read the culture around us, and that love for God and people drives us to confront idols with the good news of the living Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">His spirit was stirred</span> <span class= "bld">in him.</span>--The verb is the root of the noun from which we get our "paroxysm," and which is translated by "sharp contention" in <a href="/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>. Athens, glorying now, as it had done in the days of Sophocles (<span class= "ital">?dip.

The city was "full of idols;" Hermes-busts at every corner, statues and altars in the <span class= "ital">atrium</span> or court-yard of every house, temples and porticos and colonnades, all presenting what was to him the same repulsive spectacle. He looked on the Theseus and the Ilissus, and the friezes of the Centaurs and Lapithae on the Parthenon, as we look on them in our museums, but any sense of art-beauty which he may have had (and it was probably, in any case, but weak) was over-powered by his horror that men should bow down and worship what their own hands had made. The beauty of form which we admire in the Apollo or the Aphrodite, the Mercury or the Faun, would be to him, in its unveiled nakedness, a thing to shudder at. He knew too well to what that love of sensuous beauty had led in Greek and Roman life (<a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24-27</a>), when it had thrown aside what, to a Jew, were not only the natural instincts of purity, but the sanctions of a divine command (<a href="/genesis/9-22.htm" title="And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers without.">Genesis 9:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Provoked within</span> for <span class="accented">stirred in</span>, A.V.
