His ability to engage in public debate reflects the Greco-Roman culture of rhetoric and public discourse. The term "powerfully" suggests that Apollos was not only knowledgeable but also persuasive and effective in his arguments. This public setting indicates that these debates were likely held in synagogues or other communal spaces where Jews gathered, emphasizing the importance of open dialogue in the early church. The act of refuting suggests a strong opposition to the message of Jesus as the Messiah, which was a common challenge faced by early Christians.<p><b>proving from the Scriptures</b><br>Apollos used the Hebrew Scriptures, what Christians refer to as the Old Testament, to demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. This method of proving was crucial because it connected the new Christian faith with the ancient Jewish tradition, showing continuity and fulfillment. Key prophecies likely referenced include <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant, and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the crucifixion in detail. This approach was essential for convincing Jewish audiences who held the Scriptures in high regard.<p><b>that Jesus is the Christ</b><br>The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." By proving that Jesus is the Christ, Apollos was asserting that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah prophesied in the Jewish Scriptures. This claim was central to the Christian faith and was a point of contention with Jewish leaders who did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. The declaration that Jesus is the Christ is foundational to Christian doctrine, affirming His role as the Savior and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. This assertion also ties into the broader narrative of the New Testament, where Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are seen as the culmination of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apollos.htm">Apollos</a></b><br>A learned Jew from Alexandria, known for his eloquence and knowledge of the Scriptures.

The process was, perhaps, somewhat different, as the line of argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews differs from that in the Epistle to the Galatians. To lead men on, after the manner of Philo, into the deeper meanings that lay beneath the letter of Scripture, to deal with them as those who were pressing forwards to the perfection of maturity in spiritual growth (<a href="/context/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11-14</a>), instead of treating them as children who must be fed with milk and not with "strong meat" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>solid food), as St. Paul had done (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>)--it was natural that this should attract followers to the new preacher, and give him a larger measure of real or apparent success in dealing with the Jews than had attended the labours of St. Paul. As Apollos does not appear again in the Acts, it may be well to bring together what is known as to his after-history. At Corinth, as has been said, his name was used as the watchword of a party, probably that of the philosophising Jews and proselytes, as distinguished from the narrower party of the circumcision that rallied round the name of Cephas (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>). Not a word escapes from St. Paul that indicates any doctrinal difference between himself and Apollos, and as the latter had been instructed by St. Paul's friends, Aquila and Priscilla, this was, indeed, hardly probable. It would appear from <a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>, that he returned to Ephesus, probably with letters of commendation from the Church of Corinth (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>). St. Paul's confidence in him is shown by his desire that he should return once more to Corinth with Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. His own reluctance to be the occasion even of the semblance of schism explains his unwillingness to go (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>). After this we lose sight of him for some years. These, we may well believe, were well filled up by evangelising labours after the pattern of those which we have seen at Ephesus and Corinth. Towards the close of St. Paul's ministry (A. D. 65) we get our last glimpse of him, in <a href="/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>. He is in company with Zenas, the lawyer (see Note on <a href="/matthew/22-35.htm" title="Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,">Matthew 22:35</a>), one, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, who, like himself, had a special reputation for the profounder knowledge of the Law of Moses. St. Paul's feeling towards him is still, as of old, one of affectionate interest, and he desires that Titus will help him in all things. He has been labouring at Crete, and there also has gathered round him a distinct company of disciples, whom St. Paul distinguishes from his own; "Let <span class= "ital">our's</span> also learn to maintain good works" (<a href="/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>). After this, probably after St. Paul's death, he wrote--if we accept Luther's conjecture--the Epistle to the Hebrews, addressed, as some have thought, to the Jewish Christians of Palestine, and specially of Caesarea, but, more probably, as I have been led to believe, to the Christian ascetics, known as Therapeutae, trained, like himself, in the school of Philo, with whom he had formerly been associated at Alexandria. The mention of disciples of, or from, Italy in <a href="/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.">Hebrews 13:24</a> suggests a connection with some other Italian Christians than those of Rome, probably with those of Puteoli.

It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). St. Luke, too, Paul's friend and biographer, here speaks of the powers and work of Apollos with no stinted measure of praise. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
