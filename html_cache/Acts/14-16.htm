It highlights the period when God allowed humanity to live without the direct revelation of His will as given through the Law to Israel. This era is often associated with the Gentile nations who did not have the same covenant relationship with God as Israel did. The phrase suggests a time of divine patience and forbearance, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, where Paul speaks of God overlooking the times of ignorance.<p><b>He let all nations</b><br>This indicates God's sovereign decision to permit the Gentile nations to follow their own paths. It reflects the biblical theme of God's allowance for human free will and the consequences of turning away from Him. This is consistent with the Old Testament narrative, where Israel is chosen as God's people, while other nations are not given the same direct guidance. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-32</a> elaborates on how God gave people over to their sinful desires as a result of their rejection of Him.<p><b>go their own way</b><br>This phrase underscores the autonomy that God allowed the nations, which often led to idolatry and moral decay. It reflects the biblical understanding of human rebellion and the tendency to stray from God's commandments. The phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of humanity's fall and the need for redemption through Christ. It also points to the fulfillment of prophecy, as the coming of Christ and the spread of the Gospel would eventually bring light to the Gentiles, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>The apostles who were on their first missionary journey, spreading the Gospel and establishing churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lystra.htm">Lystra</a></b><br>A city in the region of Lycaonia where Paul and Barnabas preached and performed miracles, including healing a man who was lame from birth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_nations.htm">Gentile Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the non-Jewish peoples who, in past generations, were allowed by God to follow their own paths without the direct revelation of the Law or the prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The overarching theme of God's control and allowance of human free will throughout history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_and_paganism.htm">Idolatry and Paganism</a></b><br>The prevalent religious practices among the Gentile nations during the time before the Gospel was spread to them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Patience and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God, in His sovereignty, allowed nations to follow their own paths, demonstrating His patience and long-suffering nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universal_need_for_the_gospel.htm">The Universal Need for the Gospel</a></b><br>Despite God's allowance of different paths, the Gospel is now the universal call to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ for all nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_responsibility_and_divine_allowance.htm">Human Responsibility and Divine Allowance</a></b><br>While God allows free will, humans are responsible for their choices and the consequences that follow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_general_revelation.htm">The Role of General Revelation</a></b><br>Even without the Law, God's attributes were evident in creation, leaving humanity without excuse for idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_evangelism.htm">The Urgency of Evangelism</a></b><br>Understanding that God once allowed ignorance but now calls for repentance, Christians are urged to share the Gospel with urgency.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_14_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 14:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_14_16_God_s_patience_in_past_ignorance.htm">How does Acts 14:16 illustrate God's patience with humanity's past ignorance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Acts_14_16_on_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">What does Acts 14:16 reveal about God's sovereignty over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_14_16_Guide_for_Gospel_outreach.htm">How can Acts 14:16 guide our response to those unaware of the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_14_16_Rom_1_20_on_creation.htm">Connect Acts 14:16 with Romans 1:20 on God's revelation through creation.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Acts_14_16_s_impact_on_evangelism.htm">How should Acts 14:16 influence our evangelism approach to unreached people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_14_16_and_Christian_free_will.htm">How does Acts 14:16 align with the concept of free will in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_let_nations_go_their_own_way.htm">Why did God allow nations to walk in their own ways according to Acts 14:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Acts_14_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Acts 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_all_nations_see_god's_salvation.htm">Psalm 98:2 asserts God&#8217;s salvation is seen by all nations.

God remained in control while permitting the Gentile world to experience life without Israel&#8217;s unique covenant light (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; This permissive governance displayed both patience and justice. When nations suppressed basic revelation in creation and conscience, God &#8220;gave them up&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-26</a>), allowing consequences to unfold.<p>&#8226; Even as He &#8220;let&#8221; them, He still showered common grace: &#8220;Yet He has not left Himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go their own way</b><p>&#8226; Humanity&#8217;s &#8220;own way&#8221; is the path of self-rule that departs from the Creator&#8217;s design (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeated biblical snapshots illustrate this pattern:<p>&#8211; In Noah&#8217;s day, &#8220;every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was altogether evil&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>).<p>&#8211; At Babel, they pursued fame apart from God (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4-9</a>).<p>&#8211; In the era of the Judges, &#8220;Everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Allowing people to follow that trajectory exposes sin&#8217;s emptiness and highlights their need for rescue. The stage is thus set for the gospel invitation that follows immediately in <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a> and climaxes in the call to repentance (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a> teaches that, before the full light of Christ&#8217;s gospel, God exercised patient sovereignty by permitting the Gentile nations to pursue their chosen paths. This permissive season was never abandonment; He continued to govern history, provide common grace, and preserve a witness to His goodness. By allowing human autonomy to reveal its own futility, God prepared hearts for the saving message now proclaimed to all peoples in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Who in times past suffered all nations.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">all the heathen;</span> the term used being that which is always employed of the nations outside the covenant of Israel. We have here the first germ of what may be fairly described as St. Paul's philosophy of history. The times of ignorance had been permitted by God, and those who had lived in them would be equitably dealt with, and judged according to their knowledge. The same thought meets us again in the speech at Athens (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>). In Romans 1, 2, 11, we meet with it, in an expanded form, as a more complete vindication of the righteousness of God. The ignorance and the sins of the Gentile world had been allowed to run their course, as the Law had been allowed to do its partial and imperfect work among the Jews, as parts, if one may so speak, of a great divine drama, leading both to feel the need of redemption, and preparing both for its reception. All were included in unbelief that God might have mercy upon all (<a href="/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">generations gone by</span> for <span class="accented">times</span> past, A.V.; <span class="accented">the nations</span> for <span class="accented">nations</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
