His exaltation assures believers that our redemption is complete and our King is sovereign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit</b><p>&#8226; The Father had long pledged to send the Spirit (<a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). Jesus reminded the disciples, &#8220;And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>).<p>&#8226; Having finished His saving work, the exalted Christ receives the Spirit in a new covenant capacity and becomes the One who dispenses Him.

Peter declares, &#8220;This is what was spoken by the prophet Joel&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16</a>), citing <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>: &#8220;I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The outpouring signals the arrival of the last days and the launching of the Church&#8217;s worldwide mission (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Later events echo the same pattern, whether in Samaria (<a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>), Caesarea (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-45</a>), or Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul affirms the ongoing richness of this gift: the Spirit &#8220;whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>).

His exaltation guarantees His authority; His reception of the Spirit secures the new covenant; His outpouring empowers the Church.
