In the context of <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, this day was likely chosen to maximize Herod's influence and display of power. The term "appointed" suggests a premeditated plan, possibly aligning with Roman or local customs, which often included games, feasts, or public addresses.<p><b>Herod donned his royal robes</b><br>Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod the Great, was known for his political acumen and desire to maintain favor with both the Roman authorities and the Jewish populace. His royal robes symbolize authority and splendor, reflecting his status and the importance of the occasion. Historically, such garments were made of luxurious materials, possibly even silver-threaded, as some accounts suggest, to reflect light and enhance his majestic appearance.<p><b>sat on his throne</b><br>The throne is a symbol of power and judgment. Herod's act of sitting on the throne signifies his role as a ruler and judge over the people. In the ancient Near East, thrones were often elevated, signifying the ruler's elevated status above the people. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of kingship and authority, contrasting with the humble throne of Christ, who reigns with justice and righteousness.<p><b>and addressed the people</b><br>Herod's address to the people was likely a speech designed to win favor and assert his authority. Public speaking was a critical skill for rulers in the Roman Empire, used to communicate power, policy, and propaganda. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the subsequent events in the narrative, where Herod's pride and the people's response lead to divine judgment. The act of addressing the people also connects to the biblical theme of leadership and the responsibility of rulers to lead with humility and justice, as seen in the contrast with Christ's teachings on servant leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king of Judea, known for his persecution of the early church.

The passage calls believers to recognize the Lord&#8217;s sovereign timing, reject self-glorification, submit every authority to the King of kings, and reserve all glory for Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And upon a set day . . .</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xix. 8, ? 2) gives an account of the incident that follows substantially agreeing with that here recorded. The scene was the theatre at Caesarea, which had been built by Herod the Great. Agrippa was celebrating games in honour of the Emperor Claudius, who had succeeded Caligula in A.D. 41, possibly in honour of his return from Britain in A.D. 44. He was arrayed in a robe of silver tissue, such as Caligula had been wont to wear at banquets and games in Rome, which glittered with a dazzling brightness under the rays of the morning sun. His courtiers, taking up the Roman fashion of showing honour to kings and emperors, hailed him as a god, and prayed him, as such, to be propitious to them. The king did not repress the flattery, which fell on the ears of all Jewish by-standers as a fearful blasphemy. He accepted for himself the divine honours which he had dissuaded Caligula from claiming. He looked up, and saw an owl perched on a rope behind him, and recognised in it an omen of evil, fulfilling a prediction which had been made to him by a fellow-prisoner during his confinement at Rome (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 8). Sharp pain fell on him, and in five days he died.<p>Comparing St. Luke's narrative with this, it seems probable that the delegates from Tyre and Sidon were among those who raised the cry, "Be thou propitious to us," and that their friend Blastus, knowing the weak point in Herod's character, had instructed them that this was the way to obtain his favour. We feel, as we read the narrative, the contrast between St. Peter's refusal even of Cornelius's attitude of homage, and Agrippa's acceptance of the profane apotheosis of the multitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- Arrayed himself</span> for <span class="accented">arrayed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and sat</span> for <span class="accented">sat</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">on the throne</span> for <span class="accented">upon his throne</span>, A.V.
