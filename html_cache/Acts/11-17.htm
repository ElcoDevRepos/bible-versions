The context here is Peter's defense of his actions in sharing the Gospel with the Gentiles, specifically Cornelius and his household. The "same gift" emphasizes the equality of Jews and Gentiles in receiving the Holy Spirit, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a> that God's Spirit would be poured out on all people. This marks a significant shift in the early church's understanding of God's plan for salvation, breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers.<p><b>He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>The phrase underscores the condition of faith in Jesus Christ as the basis for receiving the Holy Spirit. This aligns with the core message of the New Testament that salvation and the accompanying indwelling of the Spirit are available to all who believe in Jesus (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The early church, primarily Jewish, is now witnessing the inclusion of Gentiles, which was a radical development. This reflects the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant that through Abraham's seed, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>who was I to hinder the work of God?</b><br>Peter's rhetorical question highlights his recognition of God's sovereign will and the futility of opposing it. This echoes the theme of divine initiative seen throughout Acts, where God's purposes prevail despite human resistance (<a href="/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>). Peter's humility and submission to God's plan serve as a model for believers, emphasizing that God's work transcends human traditions and prejudices. This moment is pivotal in the early church, as it sets the stage for the Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the inclusion of Gentiles is formally acknowledged and affirmed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his experience with Cornelius and the Gentiles receiving the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion whose household was among the first Gentiles to receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were receiving the message of the Gospel and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The place where Peter is explaining his actions to the Jewish believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The gift from God that was given to both Jewish and Gentile believers, signifying their acceptance by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_salvation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Salvation</a></b><br>God is the ultimate authority in granting salvation and the Holy Spirit, transcending human boundaries and prejudices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The same Holy Spirit is given to all believers, emphasizing the unity and equality of all members of the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_leading.htm">Obedience to God's Leading</a></b><br>Like Peter, we must be willing to follow God's leading, even when it challenges our preconceived notions or traditions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_down_barriers.htm">Breaking Down Barriers</a></b><br>The Gospel calls us to break down barriers of race, culture, and tradition, welcoming all who believe in Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_god's_work.htm">Witnessing God's Work</a></b><br>We should be attentive to how God is working in unexpected ways and be ready to testify to His grace and power.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_11_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 11:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_God_s_impartial_salvation.htm">How does Acts 11:17 emphasize God's impartiality in granting salvation to all?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_Holy_Spirit_s_role_in_salvation.htm">What does Acts 11:17 teach about the Holy Spirit's role in salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_Accept_God_s_gifts_freely.htm">How can Acts 11:17 inspire us to accept God's gifts without hesitation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_11_17_to_Peter_s_Acts_10_vision.htm">How does Acts 11:17 connect with Peter's vision in Acts 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_s_impact_on_evangelism.htm">How should Acts 11:17 influence our approach to evangelism and inclusivity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_Gentile_inclusion_proof.htm">How does Acts 11:17 support the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_God_s_impartial_Spirit_gift.htm">What does Acts 11:17 reveal about God's impartiality in granting the Holy Spirit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_11_17_vs_Jewish_salvation_beliefs.htm">How does Acts 11:17 challenge traditional Jewish beliefs about salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_gift_of_faith.htm">What is the Gift of Faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'out_of_egypt'_mean.htm">What does 'Every good and perfect gift is from above' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_religious_festivals.htm">What does 'rain on the just and unjust' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_no_record_of_peter's_vision_site.htm">Why is there no archaeological or historical record confirming the exact location or the nature of Peter&#8217;s vision (Acts 11)?
