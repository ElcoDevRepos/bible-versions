Judea was the heartland of Jewish culture and religion, and the early church was primarily composed of Jewish converts. The apostles were the original disciples of Jesus, entrusted with spreading His teachings. The "brothers" indicates the broader community of believers, emphasizing the familial bond among Christians. This community was deeply rooted in Jewish traditions, which influenced their initial understanding of the Gospel.<p><b>soon heard</b><br>The rapid dissemination of information highlights the close-knit nature of the early Christian community and the importance of communication in the spread of the Gospel. News traveled quickly despite the lack of modern communication methods, indicating the significance of the event. This also reflects the interconnectedness of the early church, where developments in one area were of interest to believers elsewhere.<p><b>that the Gentiles also had received the word of God</b><br>This marks a pivotal moment in the early church, as the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the Christian faith was a significant shift from Jewish exclusivity. The "word of God" refers to the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. This event fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth. It also aligns with Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." The acceptance of Gentiles was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).
