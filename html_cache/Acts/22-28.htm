During the first century, Roman citizenship was a coveted status that provided numerous legal protections and privileges. It could be acquired by birth, manumission, or purchase. The mention of a "high price" suggests the commander may have bought his citizenship during the reign of Emperor Claudius, when such transactions were common. This reflects the socio-political environment of the Roman Empire, where citizenship was both a symbol of prestige and a practical necessity for certain legal rights. The commander&#8217;s statement highlights the value and exclusivity of Roman citizenship, which was not easily accessible to non-Romans.<p><b>"But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.</b><br>Paul's response indicates that he possessed Roman citizenship by birth, a status that conferred even greater legitimacy and privilege than purchased citizenship. This implies that Paul's family had been granted citizenship, possibly due to services rendered to the Roman state or through other means such as manumission of an ancestor. Being born a citizen provided Paul with certain protections, such as the right to a fair trial and exemption from degrading punishments like scourging. This status plays a crucial role in the narrative of Acts, as it allows Paul to appeal to Caesar and ensures his protection under Roman law. Paul's citizenship is a strategic advantage in his missionary journeys, enabling him to navigate the complexities of Roman legal and social systems. This moment underscores the providence of God in equipping Paul with the necessary tools to fulfill his mission, drawing a parallel to how God prepares and equips believers for their own callings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus.

Probably the translators used the word in the sense in which we still speak of the "freedom "of a city. The chiliarch was himself, apparently, an alien by birth, and, as was customary at the time, had obtained the citizenship by the payment of a large bribe. As the admission of citizens now rested with the Emperor, as holding the office of Censor, the money had probably been paid to Narcissus, or some other of Claudius' favourite freed-men who carried on a traffic of this kind.<p><span class= "bld">I was free born.</span>--The Greek is somewhat more emphatic: <span class= "ital">I am one even from birth.</span> This implies that St. Paul's father or grandfather had received the citizenship; how, we cannot tell.
