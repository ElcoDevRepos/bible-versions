This boldness is a testament to the power of the Holy Spirit, which empowers believers to witness for Christ. It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that His followers would be His witnesses "to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).

The answer is found in the inference that the Levite of Cyprus and the tent-maker had been friends in earlier years. The culture of which Tarsus was the seat, would naturally attract a student from the neighbouring island, and the eagerness of Barnabas to secure Saul's co-operation at a later stage of his work (<a href="/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>) may fairly be looked on as furnishing a confirmation of the view now suggested. He knew enough of his friend to believe every syllable of what he told him as to the incidents of his conversion.<p><span class= "bld">Brought him to the apostles.</span>--In the more definite account in <a href="/context/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18-19</a>, we find that his primary purpose was to exchange thoughts (<span class= "greekheb">?????????</span> <span class= "ital">=</span> to inquire, the word from which we get our "history") with Peter, and that the only other leading teacher that he saw (we need not now inquire whether he speaks of him as an Apostle or not) was "James, the Lord's brother." It may, perhaps, be inferred from this, either (1) that the other Apostles were absent from Jerusalem at the time, or (2) that the new convert did not attend any public meeting of the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- How at Damascus he had preached boldly for how he had preached boldly at Damascus</span>, A.V. <span class="accented">As</span> regards the statement that <span class="cmt_word">Barnabas took him, and brought him</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the apostles</span>, which some have thought inconsistent with <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a> 19, it is obvious to remark that St. Luke's account is fully justified by the fact that St. Paul did, on Barnabas's introduction, make the acquaintance of Peter, and, as it seems, pass fifteen days as his guest (<a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>); and while there, did also see James the Lord's brother. The other apostles were probably absent from Jerusalem during that fortnight; but Barnabas did, it seems, at a Church assembly, in the presence of James and, no doubt, the elders of the Church, give the astonishing narrative of Saul's conversion. This removed their suspicious and their fears, and he was freely, during the rest of his brief stay, admitted as a brother to their assemblies, and took part in preaching the gospel in the synagogues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Barnabas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#914;&#945;&#961;&#957;&#940;&#946;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Barnabas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_921.htm">Strong's 921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Chaldee origin; son of Nabas; Barnabas, an Israelite.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought [him]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;gagen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_71.htm">Strong's 71: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; properly, to lead; by implication, to bring, drive, go, pass, or induce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
