The mention of Paul's sister's son suggests that Paul had family residing in Jerusalem, which was a central hub for Jewish life and early Christianity. The plot refers to the conspiracy by more than forty Jews who vowed not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-13</a>). This reflects the intense opposition Paul faced from Jewish leaders who saw him as a threat to their religious authority and traditions. The nephew's awareness of the plot indicates that he was either in a position to overhear such plans or had connections that informed him, showcasing the providential care of God in protecting Paul.<p><b>he went into the barracks and told Paul</b><br>The barracks refer to the Antonia Fortress, a military installation in Jerusalem where Roman soldiers were stationed. It was located near the Temple Mount, providing a strategic position for maintaining order in the city. Paul's imprisonment here underscores the Roman involvement in Jewish affairs and their role in protecting Paul from the Jewish leaders' plots. The nephew's access to the barracks suggests that he had some level of freedom and courage, as approaching a Roman military installation would not have been without risk. His decision to inform Paul directly demonstrates loyalty and the importance of family ties, as well as the urgency of the situation. This act of intervention is a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it sets in motion the events that lead to Paul's eventual transfer to Caesarea, ensuring his safety and the continuation of his mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus.

Here, the same God engineers an exact moment to protect His servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Paul&#8217;s sister</b><p>&#8226; This brief phrase reminds us that Paul had a family, a fact often overlooked. While Acts rarely mentions them, God uses ordinary relatives to accomplish His purposes.<p>&#8226; Family connections are part of God&#8217;s providence: Timothy&#8217;s faith came &#8220;first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), and Mary&#8217;s relative Elizabeth confirmed Jesus&#8217; mission before His birth (<a href="/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41-45</a>).<p>&#8226; The nephew&#8217;s role underlines that every believer, regardless of age or prominence, can be pivotal in God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard about the plot</b><p>&#8226; The conspiracy was secret, yet the nephew &#8220;heard.&#8221; The Lord exposes darkness (<a href="/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>; <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>) and ensures His purposes stand (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Mordecai discovering a plot against King Ahasuerus (<a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>) and thwarting it, the nephew&#8217;s discovery showcases divine surveillance over human schemes.<p>&#8226; This hearing implies attentiveness and courage&#8212;he was alert to evil and willing to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he went into the barracks</b><p>&#8226; The barracks (<a href="/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34, 23</a>:10) housed Roman soldiers guarding Paul.

Here, words rather than ropes secure his safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/23-16.htm">Acts 23:16</a> showcases God&#8217;s precise oversight: a timely moment, an unheralded family member, a secretly overheard plot, a courageous step into a Roman stronghold, and a truthful report that propels Paul toward his God-ordained destiny. The verse encourages us to stay alert, value every believer&#8217;s role, and act promptly when God places information or opportunity in our path, confident that His sovereign plan cannot be thwarted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Paul's sister's son.</span>--The passage is note worthy as being the only reference to any of St. Paul's relations in the Acts. The fact that St. Paul lodged with Mnason, as far as it goes, suggests the probability that neither the sister nor the nephew resided permanently in Jerusalem. We do not even know whether they were members of the Christian society, though this may, perhaps, be inferred from the eagerness of the son to save his uncle from the danger which he know to be imminent. We find that St. Paul had kinsmen at Rome (<a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="/romans/16-11.htm" title="Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.">Romans 16:11</a>). Was this nephew one of them who had come to Jerusalem to keep the feast, and heard the plot talked of (it is difficult to keep a secret in which forty men are sharers) in the caravanserai where he and other pilgrims lodged? We see, from the fact thus stated, that St. Paul, though in custody, was allowed to hold free communication with his friends. This, perhaps, accounts for the fulness with which the whole history is given. The writer of the Acts had come up with the Apostle, and was not likely to desert his friend if he could possibly gain access to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and when</span>, A.V.<span class="accented">: and he came</span> for <span class="accented">he went</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Lying in wait</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, only here and in <a href="/acts/25-3.htm">Acts 25:3</a> in the New Testament; but common in the Books of Joshua and Judges in the LXX., and also in classical Greek. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But [when]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
