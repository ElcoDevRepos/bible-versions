The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish council and court in Jerusalem, composed of Pharisees and Sadducees. This setting underscores the tension between early Christians and Jewish authorities. Paul's background as a Pharisee and his Roman citizenship gave him a unique position to address this council with authority and familiarity.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Brothers,</b><br>By addressing them as "Brothers," Paul acknowledges his shared heritage and background with the members of the Sanhedrin. This term reflects his respect and his attempt to find common ground, despite the contentious situation. It also highlights the familial bond among Jews, even amidst theological disagreements.<p><b>I have conducted myself before God</b><br>Paul emphasizes his accountability to God, rather than to human authorities. This reflects the biblical principle that one's ultimate duty is to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>, where Paul states that he seeks to please God rather than men. His statement underscores the importance of divine approval over human judgment.<p><b>in all good conscience</b><br>Paul's claim of a clear conscience indicates his sincerity and integrity in his actions and beliefs. The concept of conscience is significant in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>, where a good conscience is linked to faith and righteous living. This assertion challenges the Sanhedrin's accusations and highlights Paul's unwavering commitment to his mission.<p><b>to this day.&#8221;</b><br>By stating "to this day," Paul asserts the consistency of his faith and actions up to the present moment. This phrase underscores the continuity of his life before and after his conversion to Christianity. It also serves as a defense against any claims of hypocrisy or wrongdoing, reinforcing his steadfastness in his faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this verse.

Paul&#8217;s steady gaze fulfills that expectation, echoing the confidence seen in Peter and John before the same body (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment reminds us that &#8220;the righteous are as bold as a lion&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;Brothers,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; By calling them &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; Paul underscores shared heritage as sons of Abraham (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; He sets a conciliatory tone, seeking common ground rather than immediate confrontation, much like Stephen addressed them with the same term before witnessing to Christ (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The word also signals Paul&#8217;s genuine love for his people (<a href="/romans/10-1.htm">Romans 10:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have conducted myself before God</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s life is lived &#8220;coram Deo&#8221;&#8212;in the very presence of God.

Transparency before God naturally produces transparency before men.<p>&#8226; Such God-centered living is the call for all believers: &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in all good conscience</b><p>&#8226; Conscience is the inner witness that affirms or condemns behavior (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>).

He will echo the same claim soon afterward: &#8220;I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; A good conscience empowers bold testimony; when believers harbor unconfessed sin, courage evaporates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to this day.</b><p>&#8226; Paul testifies not only to past moments but to an unbroken pattern up to the very present.

He had not seen it since he had stood there among Stephen's accusers, a quarter of a century ago. Many changes, of course, had come about in that interval, but some of the faces were probably the same; and at all events the general aspect of the G<span class= "ital">azith, </span>or Hall of Meeting, on the south side of the Temple, with its circular benches must have remained the same.<p><span class= "bld">I have lived in all good conscience . . .</span>--The verb for "I have lived" means literally, <span class= "ital">I have used my citizenship.</span> It had ceased, however, to have this sharply defined meaning (see Note on the kindred substantive in <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>), and had come to be used of the whole course of a man's social conduct. Perhaps <span class= "ital">My mode of life has been in all good conscience, </span>would be the nearest English equivalent. The reference to "conscience" may be noted as eminently characteristic of St. Paul. So we find him saying of himself that he had all his life served God with "a pure conscience" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2Timothy 1:3</a>); that a "good conscience" is the end of the commandment (<a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>); or, again, recognising the power of conscience even among the heathen (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>). In the phrase "I know nothing by myself," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"I am conscious of no fault" (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), we have a like reference to its authority. Comp. also <a href="/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-25.htm" title="Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:">1Corinthians 10:25</a>. And in all these passages he assigns to conscience its true functions with an exact precision. It is not an infallible guide and requires illumination, and therefore each man needs to pray for light, but it is never right to act against its dictates, and that which is objectively the better course is subjectively the worse, unless the man in his heart believes it to be the better. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Looking steadfastly on</span> for <span class="accented">earnestly beholding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I have lived before God</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">I have lived</span>, etc., <span class="accented">before God</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Looking steadfastly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4, 12</a>; <a href="/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>; <a href="/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>; <a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>; <a href="/acts/11-6.htm">Acts 11:6</a>; <a href="/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9</a>; <a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>.
