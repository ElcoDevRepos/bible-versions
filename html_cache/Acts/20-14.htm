Assos was an ancient city located in the region of Mysia in modern-day Turkey. It was known for its strategic location and its harbor, which facilitated travel and trade. Paul had chosen to travel on foot from Troas to Assos, a journey of about 20 miles, possibly for personal reflection or to avoid potential threats. This decision highlights Paul's dedication and the physical demands of his missionary journeys. The meeting at Assos underscores the importance of fellowship and unity among early Christians, as seen in other passages like <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>.<p><b>we took him aboard</b><br>This phrase signifies the continuation of Paul's journey by sea. The use of a ship was common for long-distance travel in the ancient Mediterranean world. The act of taking Paul aboard reflects the logistical planning involved in his missionary work and the cooperation among his companions. It also illustrates the reliance on maritime routes for spreading the Gospel, as seen in Paul's other voyages in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>.<p><b>and went on to Mitylene</b><br>Mitylene was the chief city of the island of Lesbos, known for its cultural and economic significance. The journey to Mitylene indicates a strategic route through the Aegean Sea, which was a hub of early Christian activity. This stop is part of Paul's third missionary journey, during which he was strengthening the churches and spreading the Gospel. The mention of Mitylene connects to the broader narrative of Acts, where the spread of Christianity often followed major trade routes and urban centers, as seen in Paul's visits to cities like Ephesus and Corinth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is traveling and spreading the Gospel.
