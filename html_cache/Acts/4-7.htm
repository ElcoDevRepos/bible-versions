The Sanhedrin was composed of chief priests, elders, and scribes, and it held significant religious and political authority in Jerusalem. This setting underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and Jewish religious leaders. The apostles' arrest followed the healing of a lame man at the temple gate, which drew public attention and concern from the authorities.<p><b>and began to question them:</b><br>The questioning by the Sanhedrin reflects the legal and religious scrutiny faced by the apostles. In Jewish tradition, questioning was a method to discern truth and maintain religious order. This interrogation is reminiscent of the trials Jesus faced, highlighting the continuity of opposition to the message of Jesus Christ. The apostles' boldness in the face of such questioning fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would be brought before rulers and councils (<a href="/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17-20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;By what power or what name did you do this?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the Sanhedrin is significant in Jewish culture, where names and authority were deeply intertwined. In biblical times, a name represented a person's character and authority. The leaders were concerned about the source of the apostles' power, as performing miracles or teaching in a name other than God's could be considered blasphemous or heretical. This inquiry echoes the challenge to Jesus' authority during His ministry (<a href="/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23</a>). The apostles' response would affirm the divine authority of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit working through them, fulfilling the promise of empowerment in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Two of Jesus' apostles who were instrumental in the early church.

This fulfills Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;They will lay hands on you and persecute you, delivering you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors on account of My name&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene highlights the clash between earthly authority and the risen Christ&#8217;s authority (compare <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses these forced appearances as platforms for witness, just as He promised (<a href="/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and began to question them:</b><p>&#8226; Interrogation, not conversation; the council intends to intimidate.<p>&#8226; Yet the apostles stand calm, echoing promises like, &#8220;The Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you should say&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-12.htm">Luke 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter, previously fearful (<a href="/luke/22-54.htm">Luke 22:54-62</a>), now boldly faces the same rulers&#8212;evidence of the Spirit&#8217;s power received at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today can draw courage from this moment when we are &#8220;ready to make a defense to everyone who asks&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;By what power or what name did you do this?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jewish leaders link miracle and message, demanding to know the source of authority.

Their question&#8212;&#8220;By what power or what name?&#8221;&#8212;opens the door for the apostles to declare that the risen Jesus is both the source of power and the only name that saves.
