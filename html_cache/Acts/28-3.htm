This reflects the servant leadership modeled by Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The setting is the island of Malta, where Paul and others were shipwrecked. The gathering of sticks indicates the need for warmth and sustenance, highlighting the practical challenges faced by Paul and his companions.<p><b>and as he laid them on the fire</b><br>The fire symbolizes both physical warmth and spiritual purification. In biblical terms, fire often represents God's presence and judgment (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Paul's act of laying sticks on the fire can be seen as contributing to the well-being of the group, emphasizing community and cooperation.<p><b>a viper, driven out by the heat</b><br>The viper represents danger and the presence of evil, reminiscent of the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The heat driving out the viper can symbolize how the light of Christ exposes and expels darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). In the cultural context, vipers were common in the Mediterranean region, and their sudden appearance would have been a cause for alarm.<p><b>fastened itself to his hand</b><br>The viper fastening itself to Paul's hand is significant, as the hand often symbolizes action and power. This incident could be seen as a test of faith, similar to the trials faced by Job. In the broader narrative of Acts, it demonstrates God's protection over Paul, as he suffers no harm (<a href="/acts/28-5.htm">Acts 28:5</a>). This event also serves as a sign to the islanders of Paul's divine mission, echoing Jesus' promise in <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> that believers will handle snakes without harm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this event.

The fact thus mentioned has been dwelt on as militating against the identity of Melita and Malta, no wood being now found in the island except at one spot (<span class= "ital">Bosquetta</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>not near St. Paul's Bay. The Greek word, however, is applied to the dry stalks of herbaceous plants rather than to the branches of trees, and, as such, exactly describes the stout, thorny heather that still grows near the bay. It is clear, however, apart from this, that the people of Malta did not live without fire, and, not having coal, must therefore have had wood of some kind as fuel.<p><span class= "bld">There came</span> <span class= "bld">a viper out of the heat.</span>--There are said to be no venomous serpents now in Malta, and this again has been pressed into the question of the identity of the island. Mr. Lewin, however (<span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>ii. 208), states that he saw a serpent, near St. Paul's Bay, that looked very like a viper; and even if he were mistaken in this, it would be natural enough that venomous snakes should disappear under the influence of culture, as they have done elsewhere, in the course of 1800 years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; a <span class="accented">viper came</span> for <span class="accented">there came a viper</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by reason of</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had gathered</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here and in the LXX. of <a href="/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a> and Judges 12:4, for "to collect," "gather together."

The word only occurs in the New Testament here; it means "dry sticks," "kindlers," any combustible material. In the LXX. it is used as the equi- valent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, straw or stubble (<a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, etc.), and for "nettles" (<a href="/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>). Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - "When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood." This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). <span class="cmt_word">A viper came out</span>. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. <span class="accented">Came out.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., "came out through the sticks."
