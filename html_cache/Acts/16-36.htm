The jailer here is likely the same one who witnessed the miraculous events of the previous night, including the earthquake and the conversion of his household. His role as a messenger indicates a shift in his relationship with Paul, from captor to one who respects and perhaps even admires him. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>, where the jailer and his family come to faith.<p><b>The magistrates have sent orders to release you:</b><br>The magistrates, or "praetors," were the chief officials in a Roman colony like Philippi. Their decision to release Paul and Silas may have been influenced by the realization of their Roman citizenship, which they had violated by beating and imprisoning them without trial (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37-38</a>). This reflects the legal protections afforded to Roman citizens, highlighting the importance of citizenship in the Roman Empire. The magistrates' change of heart could also be seen as a divine intervention, ensuring the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>Now you may go on your way in peace:</b><br>The phrase "in peace" suggests a formal dismissal, allowing Paul and Silas to leave without further harassment. This peace is not just a cessation of conflict but also a deeper spiritual peace that comes from God, as seen in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>. The release signifies a victory for the early church, as the Gospel continues to spread despite opposition. It also prefigures the peace that believers have in Christ, who is the ultimate source of peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).
