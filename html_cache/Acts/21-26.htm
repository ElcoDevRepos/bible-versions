The purification ritual was part of the Nazirite vow, a practice described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>, which involved abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with the dead, and not cutting one's hair. This act of purification was necessary for entering the temple, as it demonstrated ceremonial cleanliness. Paul's participation underscores his respect for the Law and his desire to maintain peace with Jewish believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>, where he becomes "as a Jew" to win the Jews. This also highlights the tension between Jewish traditions and the new covenant in Christ, a recurring theme in Acts.<p><b>Then he entered the temple to give notice of the date when their purification would be complete</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a place where specific rituals and sacrifices were performed. By entering the temple, Paul was adhering to the Jewish law that required public declaration of the completion of a vow. This act of giving notice was a formal procedure, ensuring that the priests were aware of the timeline for the purification process. The temple's significance is rooted in its role as the dwelling place of God's presence, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>. Paul's actions here also reflect the early church's struggle to define the relationship between Jewish customs and Christian faith.<p><b>and the offering would be made for each of them.</b><br>The offering mentioned refers to the sacrifices required at the end of a Nazirite vow, which included a burnt offering, a sin offering, and a peace offering, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/6-13.htm">Numbers 6:13-20</a>. These offerings were a means of expressing devotion and seeking atonement. Paul's willingness to participate in these offerings demonstrates his respect for Jewish law and his effort to bridge the gap between Jewish and Gentile believers. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfilled the law and offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>.

St. Paul, having made himself the representative of the Nazarite company, had to give, in their name, the formal notice to the priests, who were to be ready for the sacrifices when the seven days had expired. Seven days was, it will be noted, the ordinary period for the more solemn purifications (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-6.htm" title="And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.">Leviticus 13:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm" title="This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:14</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- Went</span> for <span class="accented">entered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">declaring the fulfillment</span> for to <span class="accented">signify the accomplishment</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the offering was</span> for <span class="accented">that an offering should be</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Paul took the men</span>.

What was the particular form by which a person who wished to associate himself with others under a Nazaritic vow (note on ver. 24) did so is not known; nor how long before the expiration of the vow such association must be made. But from the mention of "seven days" in ver. 27 (which is the number named in <a href="/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9</a>, in case of an accidental uncleanness), it seems highly probable that "seven days" was the term during which a person must have conformed to the Nazaritic vow to entitle him to "be at charges," as well, perhaps, as the time during which Nazarites, at the end of their vow, had to undergo special purification. <span class="cmt_word">Declaring the fulfillment</span>, etc. The vow of the four men had been for at least thirty days (the minimum period of such vow); but whatever length of time it had been for, such time would have expired by the end of the seven days, and probably long before. We know not how long they might have been waiting for some one to "be at charges" for them, and provide the sacrifices, without which they could not shave their heads and accomplish their vow. But it is obvious that some notice must be given to the priests in the temple of the day when one or more Nazarites would present themselves at "the door of the tabernacle of the congregation," to offer the prescribed offerings. And this accordingly Paul and the four did. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> means "notifying," or "declaring," to the priests (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> [LXX., answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>]; <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>; Joshua 6:9, LXX. [Joshua 6:10, A.V., "bid"]). <span class="cmt_word">Until the offering was offered</span>, etc. This is interpreted in two ways. Meyer makes "until" depend upon "the fulfillment of the days," so as to define that fulfillment as not taking place till the offering was offered. Wieseler makes "until" depend upon "he entered into the temple," with the idea supplied, "and remained there," or "came there daily;" supposing that it was the custom for Nazarites to finish up their time of separation by passing the last seven days, or at least being present daily, in "the court of the women, where was the apartment appropriated to the Nazarites" (Lewin, it. p. 142). If, however, with Howson, Lewin and others, we understand the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in vers. 24 and 20, not generally of taking the Nazarite vow, but of certain special purifications at the close of a Nazaritic vow, which lasted seven days immediately before the offerings were made and the head shaven, then a very easy and natural rendering of the words follows: "Notifying their intention of now completing the seven days of their purification, until the offering for each of them was offered." Alford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., justifies by examples the aorist indicative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, instead of the subjunctive, which is more usual. Lewin thinks that St. Paul had taken a Nazaritic vow after his escape from death at Ephesus, or at Corinth; but there is no evidence of this, and it is hardly consistent with James's advice. Renan thinks it doubtful whether or no Paul took the Nazaritic vow at all, but inclines to this as the best interpretation ('St. Paul,' p. 518, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
