The journey by sea was a common mode of travel in the ancient Mediterranean world, often dictated by prevailing winds and currents. Paul's travels were strategic for spreading the Gospel, as he visited key cities that were centers of trade and culture.<p><b>we arrived the next day opposite Chios</b><br>Chios is an island in the Aegean Sea, known in antiquity for its wine and mastic production. The phrase "opposite Chios" suggests that Paul and his companions sailed along the coast, likely staying close to land for navigation and safety. This reflects the typical maritime routes of the time, which avoided open sea travel when possible.<p><b>The day after that we arrived at Samos</b><br>Samos is another island in the Aegean Sea, famous for its temple of Hera and as the birthplace of the philosopher Pythagoras. The mention of Samos highlights the route taken by Paul, which was a well-traveled path connecting various islands and coastal cities. This journey underscores the interconnectedness of the ancient world and the spread of early Christianity through established trade routes.<p><b>and on the following day we came to Miletus</b><br>Miletus was an important ancient city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It was a major port and a center of commerce and culture. Paul's decision to stop at Miletus, rather than Ephesus, was likely due to time constraints, as he was hurrying to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost. Miletus is significant in the biblical narrative as the place where Paul delivered a farewell address to the Ephesian elders, emphasizing themes of leadership, vigilance, and the Holy Spirit's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his missionary journey, spreading the Gospel and strengthening the early Christian churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chios.htm">Chios</a></b><br>An island in the Aegean Sea, known for its strategic location and historical significance in ancient times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samos.htm">Samos</a></b><br>Another island in the Aegean Sea, famous for its rich history and as the birthplace of the philosopher Pythagoras.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/miletus.htm">Miletus</a></b><br>A city on the western coast of Asia Minor, significant as a center of early Christian activity and where Paul later meets with the Ephesian elders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/missionary_journey.htm">Missionary Journey</a></b><br>This passage is part of Paul's third missionary journey, highlighting his dedication to visiting and encouraging the early Christian communities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_perseverance_in_ministry.htm">The Importance of Perseverance in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul's journey, despite its challenges, underscores the need for perseverance in spreading the Gospel and serving others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning_in_ministry.htm">Strategic Planning in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul's route through Chios, Samos, and Miletus shows the importance of strategic planning and intentionality in ministry efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_fellowship.htm">Community and Fellowship</a></b><br>The journey highlights the significance of visiting and strengthening Christian communities, emphasizing the value of fellowship and mutual encouragement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_the_face_of_uncertainty.htm">Faithfulness in the Face of Uncertainty</a></b><br>Paul's travels remind us to remain faithful and committed to God's calling, even when the path is uncertain or difficult.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faith.htm">Legacy of Faith</a></b><br>Paul's journey and interactions with the early churches encourage us to consider the legacy of faith we are building and leaving for others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_20_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 20:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_20_15_Paul_s_Gospel_dedication.htm">How does Acts 20:15 demonstrate Paul's commitment to spreading the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Paul_s_ministry_journey.htm">What can we learn from Paul's journey about perseverance in ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_20_15_to_Acts_1_8_mission.htm">How does Acts 20:15 connect with Paul's mission in Acts 1:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Paul_s_travel_dedication_spiritually.htm">How can we apply Paul's travel dedication to our own spiritual journeys?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Paul_s_journey_God_s_guidance_in_missions.htm">What does Paul's journey in Acts 20:15 teach about God's guidance in missions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_20_15_s_role_in_Paul_s_missions.htm">What significance does Acts 20:15 hold in understanding Paul's missionary journeys?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_20_15_Paul_s_travel_accuracy.htm">How does Acts 20:15 reflect the historical accuracy of Paul's travels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Insights_from_Paul_s_Acts_20_15_journey.htm">What theological insights can be drawn from Paul's journey in Acts 20:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god's_goodness_prompt_repentance.htm">Did God command killings in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/archeological_proof_for_acts_20_events.htm">Is there any archeological evidence supporting the locations or events described in Acts 20?

Each of the stations named--Lesbos, Chios, Samos--has legendary and historical associations of its own, full of interest for the classical student; but these, we may well believe--the revolt of Mitylene in the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. Book iii.), the brilliant tyranny of Polycrates at Samos (Herod. iii. 39-56), even "the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle"--were nothing to the Apostle and his companions. Trogyllium, the last station named before Miletus, was a promontory on the mainland, forming the extremity of the ridge of Mycale, and separated from Samos by a narrow channel of about a mile in width. Miletus, famous for its dyes and woollen manufactures, memorable in its earlier history for the disastrous issue of its revolt against Persia (Herod. v. 28-36), was practically the port of Ephesus, the harbour of which had been gradually choked by the accumulation of silted-up sand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Sailing from</span> for <span class="accented">we sailed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">we came</span> for <span class="accented">and came</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">following</span> for <span class="accented">next</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">touched</span> for <span class="accented">arrived</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and the day after</span> for <span class="accented">and tarried at Trogyllium</span>; <span class="accented">and the next day</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Over against Chios</span>.

If the clause in the T.R. is genuine, they did not pass the night at Samos, but "made a short run from thence in the evening to Trogyllium (Alford), "the rocky extremity of the ridge of Mycale, on the Ionian coast, between which and the southern extremity of Samos the channel is barely a mile wide" ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">We came to Miletus</span>. Anciently the chief city of Ionia, and a most powerful maritime and commercial place, about twenty-eight miles south of Ephesus; though in the time of Homer it was a Carian city. In St. Paul's time it was situated on the south-west coast of the Latmian gulf, just opposite the mouth of the Meander on the east. But since his time the whole gulf of Latmos has been filled up with soil brought down by the river, so that Miletus is no longer on the seacoast, and the new mouth of the Meander is to the west instead of to the east of Miletus, which lies about eight miles inland (Lewin, vol. it. p. 90; Smith's 'Dict. of Geog.'). Miletus was the scat of a bishopric in after times. As regards this visit to Miletus, some identify it with that mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>. And it is certainly remarkable that so many of the same persons in connection with the same places are mentioned in both passages and in the pastoral Epistles generally. The identical persons are Paul, Timothy, Luke, Trophimus, Tychicus, and Apollos (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4, 5</a>, compared with <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11, 12, 20</a>); and the identical places are Corinth, Thessalonica, Troas, Ephesus, Miletus, and Crete. But the other circumstances do not agree well with the events of this journey, but seem to belong to a later period of St. Paul's life (see below, ver. 25, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Sailing on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apopleusantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_636.htm">Strong's 636: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sail away.
