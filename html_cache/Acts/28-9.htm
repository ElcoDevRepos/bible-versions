This miraculous healing demonstrated the power of God working through Paul, establishing his credibility and opening the door for further ministry. It highlights the continuation of the apostolic signs and wonders that accompanied the early church, as seen throughout the Book of Acts.<p><b>the rest of the sick on the island</b><br>The island of Malta, located in the Mediterranean Sea, was a key location for trade and travel. The mention of "the rest of the sick" suggests that there were many others suffering from various ailments. This reflects the common health challenges of the time, where medical knowledge was limited, and people often relied on traditional remedies or divine intervention for healing.<p><b>came and were cured</b><br>The act of coming to Paul indicates faith or hope in the healing power that had been demonstrated. The word "cured" implies complete healing, showcasing the divine power at work through Paul. This mirrors the healing ministry of Jesus, who healed all who came to Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>.

Luke is recording an actual event, not embellishing.<p>&#8226; God often uses one undeniable work to open doors for wider ministry&#8212;compare Elijah and the widow&#8217;s son in <a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a> or Jesus healing Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law before the crowds came (<a href="/mark/1-30.htm">Mark 1:30-34</a>).<p>&#8226;
