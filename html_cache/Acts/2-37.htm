Peter had just explained the fulfillment of prophecy through Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. The audience, primarily Jewish, would have been familiar with the Old Testament prophecies Peter referenced, such as those from Joel and Psalms. The sermon was delivered in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish religious life, during a major festival, which meant the audience was diverse, including Jews from various regions.<p><b>they were cut to the heart</b><br>This expression indicates a deep conviction and emotional response. The Greek term used here implies a piercing or stabbing sensation, suggesting that the message profoundly affected the listeners. This conviction is a work of the Holy Spirit, who was poured out on the apostles at Pentecost. The concept of being "cut to the heart" aligns with <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, which describes the Word of God as living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.<p><b>and asked Peter and the other apostles</b><br>Peter, as the spokesperson, stands with the other apostles, signifying unity and collective authority. The apostles were eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection, giving them credibility. This moment marks the beginning of the apostolic ministry, where they take on the role of teaching and guiding the early church.<p><b>&#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221;</b><br>The term "brothers" indicates a sense of community and shared heritage among the Jewish people. The question "what shall we do?" reflects a desire for repentance and action in response to the conviction they felt. This mirrors the response in <a href="/luke/3-10.htm">Luke 3:10</a>, where the crowd asks John the Baptist a similar question. The inquiry shows an openness to change and a willingness to follow the apostles' guidance, setting the stage for Peter's call to repentance and baptism in the following verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, Peter is the primary speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, delivering a powerful sermon on the day of Pentecost.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' closest followers who were present with Peter, supporting his message and ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Composed of devout Jews from every nation under heaven, gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events of Pentecost took place, a central location for Jewish worship and pilgrimage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pentecost.htm">Pentecost</a></b><br>A Jewish feast occurring fifty days after Passover, marking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/conviction_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">Conviction of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The phrase "cut to the heart" indicates a deep conviction brought about by the Holy Spirit.

The crowd &#8220;heard this,&#8221; meaning they took in the facts about Christ&#8217;s lordship and their own role in His crucifixion.<p>- Hearing is the first step God uses to awaken faith (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>: &#8220;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221;).<p>- The Spirit partners with the preached word to open ears, exactly as Jesus promised (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>).<p>- The scene mirrors <a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>, where the disciples&#8217; hearts burned while Jesus opened the Scriptures; the same living word now works through Peter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were cut to the heart</b><p>The phrase portrays deep spiritual conviction.

The consistent biblical answer centers on repentance and faith&#8212;Peter will immediately say, &#8220;Repent and be baptized&#8230; for the forgiveness of your sins&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> captures the summary: &#8220;Repent and believe in the gospel.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a> records the power of Spirit-filled preaching. As Peter proclaims Jesus, the listeners hear, feel a heart-piercing conviction, seek guidance from God-appointed leaders, and urgently ask how to respond. The verse teaches that genuine faith begins with hearing the gospel, experiencing Spirit-wrought conviction, submitting to biblical authority, and humbly seeking the obedient response God requires.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">They were pricked in their heart.</span>--The verb occurs here only in the New Testament, and expresses the sharp, painful emotion which is indicated in "compunction," a word of kindred meaning.

It is important to note from the beginning the relative position of Peter and the other apostles; a certain primacy and precedence, both in place and in action, he has undoubtedly. He is always named first, and he acts first, in preaching both to Jews and Gentiles. The keys are in his hands, and the door is first opened as he turns the lock. But it is equally clear that he is but one of the apostles; he is not set over them, but acts with them; he is not their superior, but their fellow; they are not eclipsed by his presence, but only animated by his example; inquirers after salvation do not ask at his mouth only, but of the whole college of the apostles.
