Silas, also known as Silvanus, was a respected leader in the Jerusalem church and a Roman citizen, which would have been advantageous for travel and protection in the Roman Empire. His selection by Paul indicates a strategic decision to have a partner who was both spiritually mature and practically equipped for the missionary journey. This choice follows the disagreement between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark, highlighting the human element in ministry decisions and the sovereignty of God in using different teams for His purposes.<p><b>and left</b><br>The departure of Paul and Silas marks the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey, which would take them through regions such as Syria and Cilicia. This journey was crucial for the spread of the Gospel to the Gentile world and the establishment of churches in key cities. The act of leaving also signifies obedience to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), as they set out to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>commended by the brothers</b><br>The commendation by the brothers in the church indicates a formal sending off, which was a common practice in the early church. This act of commendation reflects the unity and support of the church body, as well as the recognition of the mission's importance. It also underscores the communal aspect of ministry, where the church collectively participates in the mission through prayer, support, and accountability.<p><b>to the grace of the Lord</b><br>Being commended to the grace of the Lord emphasizes reliance on divine favor and guidance. The grace of the Lord is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, highlighting the unmerited favor and empowerment believers receive from God. This phrase also connects to the broader theological context of grace in the New Testament, where it is seen as the foundation for salvation (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) and the sustaining power for ministry (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).

This in itself was a proof of his interest in the mission-work among the Gentiles, and no one, perhaps, could be found so well fitted to fill the place of Barnabas. He too had the gift of prophetic utterance, and, as we have seen (Note on <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), was probably able to speak as one who had followed the Lord Jesus, and could bear witness of the Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">Being recommended by the brethren.</span>--See Note on <a href="/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a>.
