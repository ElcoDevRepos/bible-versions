It reflects the early church's devotion to fellowship and the apostles' teaching (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p><b>and ate</b><br>This simple act of eating underscores the humanity of the early church leaders and their participation in ordinary life.

It reflects the itinerant nature of his ministry, as he traveled extensively to establish and strengthen churches.

The loaf, probably a long roll, was placed before the celebrant, and each piece was broken off as it was given to the communicant. Stress is laid on this practice in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
