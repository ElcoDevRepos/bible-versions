The dismissal indicates the conclusion of the Sabbath service, a time when the Law and the Prophets were read and expounded upon. This setting provided an opportunity for Paul and Barnabas to engage with those who were already familiar with the Scriptures.<p><b>many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism</b><br>This phrase highlights the diverse audience present in the synagogue. "Jews" refers to ethnic Jews, while "devout converts to Judaism" (often called "God-fearers") were Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel and followed certain Jewish practices without fully converting. This group was significant in the early spread of Christianity, as they were already monotheistic and familiar with Jewish teachings.<p><b>followed Paul and Barnabas</b><br>The act of following indicates a desire to learn more and engage further with the teachings of Paul and Barnabas. This reflects the impact of their message and the authority with which they spoke. Paul, formerly a Pharisee, and Barnabas, known for his encouragement, were compelling figures in the early church.<p><b>who spoke to them and urged them</b><br>Paul and Barnabas took the opportunity to provide further teaching and encouragement. This personal interaction was crucial for discipleship and nurturing the faith of new believers. Their approach was pastoral, aiming to strengthen and guide those interested in the message of Jesus.<p><b>to continue in the grace of God</b><br>The concept of "grace" is central to Christian theology, emphasizing God's unmerited favor and the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. Paul and Barnabas encouraged their listeners to remain steadfast in this grace, highlighting the transformative power of the Gospel. This exhortation aligns with Paul's later teachings in his epistles, where he frequently emphasizes living by grace through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A former Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, Paul became a leading apostle to the Gentiles after his conversion on the road to Damascus.
