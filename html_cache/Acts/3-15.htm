The term "Author of life" signifies Jesus as the originator and sustainer of all life, aligning with <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, which states that all things were made through Him. This highlights the irony and gravity of their actions, as they sought to destroy the very source of life. Theologically, it underscores the belief in Jesus' divinity and His role in creation, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being rejected by His own people, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.<p><b>but God raised Him from the dead</b><br>This statement affirms the core Christian belief in the resurrection, which is central to the gospel message. The resurrection is seen as God's vindication of Jesus, proving His divine nature and the truth of His teachings. It fulfills prophecies like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a pivotal event that distinguishes Christianity from other faiths, as it demonstrates victory over sin and death, offering hope of eternal life to believers.<p><b>and we are witnesses of this fact</b><br>The apostles, including Peter who is speaking here, were eyewitnesses to the resurrected Christ, as detailed in <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>. Their testimony is foundational to the early church's proclamation of the gospel. The emphasis on eyewitness accounts serves to authenticate the message and encourage faith in the resurrection. This phrase also connects to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth. The apostles' witness is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that they would receive power to testify about Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who are speaking to the people in Jerusalem after healing a lame man at the temple gate called Beautiful.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_life.htm">The Author of Life</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His divine role in creation and life itself.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Father who raised Jesus from the dead, affirming His power over life and death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event where God raised Jesus from the dead, central to Christian faith and the apostles' testimony.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Peter and John, along with other apostles, who testify to the resurrection of Jesus, having seen Him alive after His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Centrality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian faith.

In <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a> we meet with it in "the <span class= "ital">Captain</span> of their salvation;" in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>, in "the <span class= "ital">Author</span> and Finisher of our faith." Its primary meaning, like that of prince (<span class= "ital">princeps</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is one who takes the lead--who is the originator of that to which the title is attached. The "Prince of life," the "Captain of salvation," is accordingly He who is the source from which life and salvation flow. In the LXX. of the Old Testament it is used for the "chieftains" or "princes" of Moab and the like (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm" title="And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.">Numbers 13:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Whereof we are witnesses.</span>--St. Peter falls back, as in <a href="/acts/2-32.htm" title="This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.">Acts 2:32</a> (where see Note), on this attestation to the one central fact. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Raised</span> for <span class="accented">bath raised</span>, A.V<span class="cmt_word">. The Prince of life</span>; a remarkable title here given to our Lord, to bring out the contrast between him whom they preferred and him whom they rejected. Barabbas was a murderer, one who took away human life for his own base ends; the other was the Prince and Author of life, who was come into the world, not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. This title, taken in connection with the preceding declaration, "God hath glorified his Servant Jesus," seems almost to be a reminiscence of our Savior's prayer," Father,... glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him" (<a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1, 2</a>). Jesus himself in very many places dwells upon his own great prerogative of giving life: "I am come that they might have life, and.., have it more abundantly" (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>); "I am that Bread of life;" "I am the living Bread ... if any man cat of this bread, he shall live for ever;" "I give... my flesh for the life of the world;" "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life;" "They that hear shall live;" "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;" "The Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should... have eternal life;" "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Christ is found also in <a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, and in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, rendered the "<span class="accented">Author</span> or <span class="accented">Captain</span> of their salvation," "of our faith." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof we are witnesses</span> (see <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, note).
