This time allowed for the strengthening of the new believers and the establishment of the church in Joppa. It also reflects the itinerant nature of apostolic ministry, as seen in other parts of Acts where apostles travel to spread the Gospel and support new Christian communities.<p><b>in Joppa</b><br>Joppa, a significant port city on the Mediterranean coast, was historically a gateway for trade and cultural exchange. It is mentioned in the Old Testament as the port from which Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). The city's diverse population would have included Jews and Gentiles, making it a strategic location for the spread of Christianity. Joppa's inclusion in the narrative highlights the early church's expansion beyond Jerusalem and Judea.<p><b>with a tanner</b><br>Tanning was considered an unclean profession by Jewish standards due to the handling of dead animals, which were ritually impure according to Levitical law (Leviticus 11). Peter's willingness to stay with a tanner demonstrates a significant shift in his understanding of purity and the inclusivity of the Gospel. This foreshadows the vision Peter receives in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where God reveals that what He has made clean should not be called impure.<p><b>named Simon</b><br>The name Simon, shared by both Peter and the tanner, is a common Jewish name, linking the two men culturally and religiously. This connection may have facilitated Peter's acceptance of the hospitality offered by Simon the tanner. The shared name also subtly underscores the theme of unity and fellowship within the early church, transcending social and occupational boundaries.<br><br>This passage, though brief, sets the stage for the pivotal events of <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where Peter's vision and encounter with Cornelius lead to the formal inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith.
