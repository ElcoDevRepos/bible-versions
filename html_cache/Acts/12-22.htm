In the context of <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, Herod Agrippa I had just delivered a public address, likely during a festival or public gathering. The crowd's reaction can be seen as a reflection of the political and social dynamics of the time, where rulers often sought to elevate their status through public displays and speeches. The use of "shout" implies a loud and possibly frenzied acclamation, which was common in ancient settings where public oratory was a form of entertainment and political engagement.<p><b>&#8220;This is the voice of a god,</b><br>The declaration that Herod's voice was that of a god reflects the ancient practice of deifying rulers. In the Greco-Roman world, emperors and kings were often ascribed divine status, either during their reign or posthumously. This practice was particularly prevalent in the Roman Empire, where the imperial cult worshipped the emperor as a god. The crowd's proclamation can be seen as an attempt to flatter Herod, possibly to gain favor or out of genuine belief in his semi-divine status. This moment also echoes the temptation of pride and the danger of accepting divine honors, which is a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>not a man!&#8221;</b><br>The contrast between "god" and "man" highlights the blasphemous nature of the crowd's acclamation. Biblically, this statement is significant because it sets the stage for God's judgment on Herod, as described later in the chapter. The distinction between divine and human is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing the uniqueness and holiness of God compared to human frailty. This moment serves as a cautionary tale against idolatry and the elevation of human leaders to divine status, reminding believers of the first commandment and the call to worship God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king of Judea, known for his persecution of the early church.

Their unified cry didn&#8217;t arise from sober reflection but from a surge of emotion and political expediency.<p>&#8226; Crowds are famously fickle: one moment honoring Jesus with palm branches, the next shouting &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>; 19:15).<p>&#8226; Public opinion can be manipulated by fear or favor. The people of Tyre and Sidon depended on Herod for food supplies (<a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>), so praising him served their interests.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns about &#8220;listening to the voice of the people&#8221; instead of the voice of God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>; <a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the voice</b><p>They fixate on Herod&#8217;s eloquence, treating polished speech as proof of divinity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-5.htm">Proverbs 29:5</a> cautions, &#8220;A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet&#8221;.

Their rejection of worship contrasts sharply with Herod&#8217;s silent acceptance.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>, even angelic glory is refused worship: &#8220;Worship God!&#8221;. If an angel rejects worship, how much more should a mortal king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not a man!</b><p>By denying Herod&#8217;s humanity, the crowd elevates him above accountability and paves the way for his downfall.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a> reminds us, &#8220;I will not give My glory to another&#8221;.

Herod repeats that folly and meets a similar judgment in <a href="/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>, where &#8220;an angel of the Lord struck him down&#8230; and he was eaten by worms and died&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> states, &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221;. Herod chose pride; opposition followed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a> records a moment when a dependent, impression-minded crowd hails Herod&#8217;s speech as divine. Their flattery exposes their idolatry, and Herod&#8217;s silent consent exposes his pride. Scripture presents this as a sober warning: glory belongs solely to God, and any human who accepts worship invites His immediate opposition. The very next verse proves the point&#8212;God acts decisively, underscoring the timeless truth that He will not share His glory with another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Shouted</span> for <span class="accented">gave a shout</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the voice</span> for <span class="accented">it is the voice</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/12-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[they]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8134;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#275;mos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1218.htm">Strong's 1218: </a> </span><span class="str2">From deo; the public.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">began to shout,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#966;&#974;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(epeph&#333;nei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2019.htm">Strong's 2019: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call out, shout, clamor at.
