Barnabas, whose name means "son of encouragement," was a Levite from Cyprus and a respected leader in the church at Antioch. Saul, later called Paul, was a former Pharisee and a zealous convert to Christianity. Their partnership highlights the unity and diversity within the early church, as they combined their unique backgrounds and gifts for the mission.<p><b>sent forth by the Holy Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role in guiding and empowering the early church is emphasized here. This divine commissioning underscores the importance of spiritual discernment and obedience to God's leading in ministry. The Holy Spirit's involvement assures that their mission is not of human origin but divinely orchestrated, fulfilling Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that His followers would be His witnesses to the ends of the earth.<p><b>went down to Seleucia</b><br>Seleucia was the port city of Antioch, located about 16 miles away. It served as a major hub for trade and travel in the Roman Empire. The journey from Antioch to Seleucia marks the beginning of their missionary journey, illustrating the strategic use of existing infrastructure for the spread of the Gospel. This movement from a significant urban center to a port city reflects the early church's outward focus and readiness to reach new regions.<p><b>and sailed from there to Cyprus</b><br>Cyprus, an island in the eastern Mediterranean, was Barnabas's homeland, making it a logical first destination for their mission. The island had a significant Jewish population, providing initial contacts for their ministry. Cyprus's location made it a crossroads of cultures and a strategic point for spreading the Gospel further into the Roman world. This journey fulfills the pattern of starting with familiar territories before moving into broader Gentile regions, as seen in Jesus' instructions in <a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of new believers, including Saul (Paul).

It had been built by, and named after, Seleucus Nicator.<p><span class= "bld">Thence they sailed to Cyprus.</span>--The population of the island was largely Greek, and the name of the chief town at the east end recalled the history or the legend of a colony under Teucer, the son of Telamon, from the Salamis of the Saronic gulf. It owned Aphrodite, or Venus, as its tutelary goddess, Paphos being the chief centre of her worship, which there, as elsewhere, was conspicuous for the licentiousness of the harlot-priestesses of her temple. The copper-mines (the metal <span class= "ital">Cuprum</span> took its name from the island), and its nearness to Syria, had probably attracted a considerable Jewish population, among whom the gospel had been preached by the Evangelist? of <a href="/acts/11-19.htm" title="Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.">Acts 11:19</a>. An interesting inscription--the date of which is, however, uncertain, and may be of the second or third century after Christ--given in M. de Cesnola's <span class= "ital">Cyprus</span> (p. 422), as found at Golgoi in that island, shows a yearning after something higher than the polytheism of Greece:--<p>THOU, THE ONE GOD,<p>THE GREATEST, THE MOST GLORIOUS NAME,<p>HELP US ALL, WE BESEECH THEE.<p>At the foot of the inscription there is the name HELIOS, the Sun, and we may probably see in it a trace of that adoption of the worship of Mithras, or the sun, as the visible symbol of Deity, which, first becoming known to the Romans in the time of Pompeius, led to the general reception of the <span class= "ital">Dies Solis</span> (= Sunday) as the first day of the Roman week, and which, even in the case of Constantine, mingled with the earlier stages of his progress towards the faith of Christ. (See Note on <a href="/acts/17-23.htm" title="For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.">Acts 17:23</a>.) The narrative that follows implies that the prudence or discernment which distinguished the proconsul may well have shown itself in such a recognition of the unity of the Godhead; and it is worthy of note that M. de Cesnola (<span class= "ital">Cyprus, </span>p. 425) discovered at Soli, in the same island, another inscription, bearing the name of Paulus the Proconsul, who may, perhaps, be identified with the Sergius Paulus of this narrative. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Went down to</span> for <span class="accented">departed unto</span>, A.V.

Seleucia was the sea-port of Antioch, about sixteen miles from it, and five miles north of the mouth of the Orontes. It was a free city by a grant from Pompey. It is now in ruins, but "the masonry of the once magnificent port of Seleucia is in so good a state that" it might be repaired and cleared out "for about &pound;31,000" (Colonel Chesney, quoted in Lewin, 1. p. 119). They sailed to Cyprus. Barnabas, no doubt, took the lead, and was naturally drawn to his native island of Cyprus - within a hundred miles of Seleucia, and, on a clear day, visible from it. The number of Jews in the island, and the partial evangelization of it which had already taken place (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19, 20</a>), and which promised them assistance and support, no doubt further influenced them. John Mark went with them, as we learn from the fifth and thirteenth verses, and possibly other brethren as deacons and ministers (see next note). They sailed straight to Salamis, "a convenient and capacious <span class="accented">harbor</span>," in the center of the eastern end of the island, and the principal or one of the principal towns. It had a large population of Jews. It was destroyed in the reign of Trajan, in consequence of a terrible insurrection of the Jews, in which they massacred 240,000 of the Gentile population. No Jew was ever after allowed to land in Cyprus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
