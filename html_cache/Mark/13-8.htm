It echoes Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/15-6.htm">2 Chronicles 15:6</a>, where similar language is used to describe divine judgment and upheaval. Historically, this can be seen in the numerous conflicts that have occurred throughout history, including the Roman-Jewish wars around the time of Jesus. Theologically, it underscores the fallen state of humanity and the pervasive nature of sin, leading to strife and division. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the spiritual battles that believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>There will be earthquakes in various places, as well as famines.</b><br>Earthquakes and famines are natural disasters that have been recorded throughout history, often seen as signs of divine displeasure or judgment. In the biblical context, earthquakes are frequently associated with significant divine interventions, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and during the crucifixion of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>). Famines, like the one in the time of Joseph (Genesis 41), are used by God to fulfill His purposes and test His people. These events are not only literal but also symbolic of the spiritual and moral upheaval that characterizes the end times. They serve as a call to repentance and reliance on God's provision and sovereignty.<p><b>These are the beginning of birth pains.</b><br>The metaphor of birth pains suggests a process that leads to a new beginning, much like the labor that precedes the birth of a child. This imagery is used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, to describe the groaning of creation as it awaits redemption. It indicates that the trials and tribulations of the present age are not the end but the precursor to the coming of God's kingdom in its fullness. This phrase reassures believers that despite the present suffering, there is hope for a future where God's promises are fulfilled. It encourages perseverance and faithfulness, as these events are part of God's redemptive plan leading to the ultimate restoration of all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, providing insight into future events to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_kingdoms.htm">Nations and Kingdoms</a></b><br>Representing political entities and powers that will be in conflict.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earthquakes.htm">Earthquakes</a></b><br>Natural disasters that signify turmoil and upheaval in the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/famines.htm">Famines</a></b><br>Periods of severe food shortage, indicating suffering and need.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' prophecy, representing all believers who are to be watchful and prepared.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' words are prophetic, providing insight into the signs of the end times.
