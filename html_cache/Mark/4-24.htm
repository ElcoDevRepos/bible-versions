In the context of <a href="/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>, Jesus is teaching in parables, a method He often used to convey deeper spiritual truths. This setting is likely around the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus frequently taught the crowds.<p><b>Pay attention to what you hear</b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of careful listening and discernment. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, oral teaching was a primary method of communication, and listeners were expected to engage actively with the message. This call to attentiveness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-21</a>, which urges believers to heed wisdom and understanding.<p><b>With the measure you use</b><br>This phrase introduces the principle of reciprocity, a common theme in Jesus' teachings. It reflects the cultural practice of measuring goods in the marketplace, where fairness and integrity were expected. This concept is also found in <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>, where Jesus speaks about judgment and mercy.<p><b>it will be measured to you</b><br>Here, Jesus underscores the idea that one's actions and attitudes will be reciprocated. This principle is consistent with the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. It serves as a reminder of God's justice and the moral order He has established.<p><b>and even more will be added to you</b><br>This promise of abundance highlights God's generosity and the principle of divine multiplication. It suggests that those who are faithful and diligent in their spiritual pursuits will receive blessings beyond their initial efforts. This idea is mirrored in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful servants are rewarded with greater responsibilities and joy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd about the importance of hearing and applying His words.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, they are being instructed on how to live out the principles of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of people who are listening to Jesus' teachings, representing a diverse audience with varying levels of understanding and commitment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening.htm">The Importance of Listening</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need to actively listen to His teachings.

The proverb furnishes a good illustration of what has just been said as to our Lord's method of presenting the same truth under different aspects. In the Sermon on the Mount it appears as the law of retribution, which brings pardon to those who pardon, judgment without mercy to those who show no mercy. Here the law works in another region. With the measure with which we mete our knowledge, God will. in His bounty, bestow more knowledge upon us. The old maxim, <span class= "ital">Docendo disces</span> ("Thou wilt learn by teaching"), becomes here more than the lesson of experience, and is one with the divine law of equity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take heed what ye hear</span>. Attend, that is, to these words which ye hear from me, that ye may understand them, and commit them to memory, and so be able to communicate them effectually to others. Let none of my words escape you. Our Lord bids us to pay the greatest attention to his words, and so to digest them that we may be able to teach them to others. <span class="cmt_word">With what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you: and more shall be given unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you.</span> Our Lord's meaning is clearly this: If you freely and plentifully communicate and preach my doctrine to others, you shall receive a corresponding reward. Nay, you shall have a return in far more abundant measure. For thus the fountains, the more water they pour out below, so much the more do they receive from above. Here, then, is great encouragement to all faithful teachers of the Word, of whatever kind; that by how much they give to others in teaching them, by so much the more shall they receive of wisdom and grace from Christ; according to those words of the apostle, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He went on to say,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
