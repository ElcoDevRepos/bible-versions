In the Gospel of Mark, houses often serve as places of deeper teaching and revelation (e.g., <a href="/mark/7-17.htm">Mark 7:17, 9</a>:28). The setting of a house may symbolize the church or the community of believers where deeper truths are revealed. It also reflects the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry, where He often used homes as places of rest and teaching.<p><b>the disciples asked Jesus</b><br>The disciples frequently sought clarification from Jesus in private, demonstrating their role as learners and followers who desired a deeper understanding of His teachings. This reflects the rabbinic tradition where disciples would ask their teacher questions to gain insight. It also highlights the disciples' ongoing struggle to comprehend the radical nature of Jesus' message, particularly regarding issues like marriage and divorce, which were culturally and religiously significant topics in Jewish society.<p><b>about this matter</b><br>The "matter" refers to Jesus' teaching on marriage and divorce, which He had just addressed publicly (<a href="/mark/10-2.htm">Mark 10:2-9</a>). This was a contentious issue in Jewish law, with different schools of thought, such as those of Hillel and Shammai, offering varying interpretations. Jesus' teaching emphasized the sanctity and permanence of marriage, aligning with the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>.

In Scripture, houses often become quiet classrooms where Jesus explains truths more fully (<a href="/mark/7-17.htm">Mark 7:17</a>; 9:28, 33; <a href="/matthew/13-36.htm">Matthew 13:36</a>).<p>&#8211; Moving indoors highlights intentional discipleship: Jesus does not leave hard sayings floating in the air; He gathers His followers to cement divine truth.<p>&#8211; The setting underscores Christ&#8217;s care. After confronting Pharisaic error on marriage, He shields His disciples from public pressure and confusion, just as <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a> promises that &#8220;The LORD confides in those who fear Him.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: spiritual clarity often comes when we step away from noise and meet with the Lord in a focused place (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the disciples asked Jesus</b><p>&#8211; Their question shows a sincere hunger for truth. Earlier, they had been &#8220;afraid to ask&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a>); now they approach Him freely, reflecting growth in trust.<p>&#8211; Jesus welcomes inquiry. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> reminds that God &#8220;gives generously to all without finding fault.&#8221; Here, the Master invites dialogue, not dismissal.<p>&#8211; This pattern&#8212;question and clarification&#8212;runs through the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/15-15.htm">Matthew 15:15</a>; <a href="/luke/8-9.htm">Luke 8:9</a>). It models healthy discipleship: bring perplexities directly to Christ, the Living Word, instead of shaping doctrine by cultural opinion.<p>&#8211; Bullet points on asking:<p>&#8226; Ask honestly&#8212;He already knows the heart (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Ask humbly&#8212;acknowledging Christ&#8217;s authority (<a href="/matthew/23-10.htm">Matthew 23:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Ask expectantly&#8212;believing His Word is sufficient (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about this matter</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;This matter&#8221; refers to marriage and divorce (<a href="/mark/10-2.htm">Mark 10:2-9</a>). The disciples sense the weight of Jesus&#8217; absolute standard. Their need for clarity proves that His teaching transcends human tradition (cf. <a href="/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10</a>).<p>&#8211; By seeking more detail, they affirm that divine commands are not negotiable; they must be understood and obeyed (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus will reiterate the permanence of marriage (<a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11-12</a>), grounding it in creation order&#8212;not societal trends&#8212;just as <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and <a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a> declare.<p>&#8211; Application: when God&#8217;s Word confronts prevailing norms, the path forward is not compromise but deeper submission. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> urges us to lean not on our own understanding but &#8220;in all your ways acknowledge Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-10.htm">Mark 10:10</a> captures a pivotal moment: once back inside, the disciples openly seek Christ&#8217;s explanation of His marriage teaching. The verse underscores the value of private communion with Jesus, the importance of asking Him direct questions, and the necessity of grasping God&#8217;s unchanging standards. True disciples step away from distraction, bring their concerns to the Lord, and receive clarity that shapes obedient living.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And in the house.</span>--St. Mark's narrative is, on the whole, much shorter than St. Matthew's; but this detail of the question coming from the disciples after they had entered the house is given by him only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The discussion with the Pharisees, related in the previous verses, had taken place in public.
