The term "seizes" indicates a sudden and forceful attack, suggesting the demon's control over the boy's physical body. This reflects the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in the Gospels, where Jesus confronts and overcomes demonic forces. The act of being thrown to the ground signifies the destructive intent of the demon, highlighting the severity of the boy's condition and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid.</b><br>These symptoms are indicative of a severe physical and spiritual affliction. Foaming at the mouth and gnashing of teeth are often associated with epilepsy, but in this context, they are attributed to demonic influence. The rigidity of the boy's body suggests a loss of control, emphasizing the demon's power over him. This description underscores the helplessness of the afflicted and the necessity of Jesus' authority to bring healing and deliverance.<p><b>I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' inability to cast out the demon highlights their lack of faith and understanding at this point in their ministry. This moment serves as a teaching opportunity for Jesus to emphasize the importance of faith and prayer in spiritual warfare. It also foreshadows the greater empowerment the disciples will receive after Jesus' resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. This failure contrasts with Jesus' authority and power, reinforcing His unique role as the Son of God who has dominion over all spiritual forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is approached by a desperate father seeking healing for his son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>- A man who brings his demon-possessed son to Jesus after the disciples fail to heal him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>- A boy suffering from a severe condition caused by an unclean spirit, manifesting in seizures and physical distress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who were unable to cast out the demon from the boy, highlighting their lack of faith or understanding at that moment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- A group of onlookers witnessing the interaction between Jesus, the father, and the disciples, representing the public's interest in Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>This passage underscores the necessity of faith in overcoming spiritual challenges.

The verse sets the stage for Jesus&#8217; decisive deliverance, reminding believers that spiritual battles are real, human strength is limited, and victory belongs to those who rely on the Lord in prayerful faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever it taketh him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">it seizeth hold of him.</span> This is the Greek word from which comes our "catalepsy," the active form of "epilepsy." <span class="cmt_word">It teareth him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). This is doubtless the literal meaning. But there is much evidence to show that it means here "it striketh or throweth him down." This is the reudering of the Peshito Syriac, and of the Vulgate. The same interpretation is also given by Hesychius as one of the meanings of the word. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-39.htm">Luke 9:39</a>) describes the symptoms thus: "A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) that he foameth (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely." This it will be remembered is the record of one who was himself a physician. <span class="cmt_word">He grindeth his teeth, and pineth away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as though the springs of his life were dried up. The father of the boy is here minutely describing the symptoms when the fit was upon him. He seems here to express the stiffness and rigidity of the body in the approaches of the malady. <span class="cmt_word">And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able</span>. They had tried and failed. This failure is attributed by our Lord (see <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>) to their want of faith; or rather to their "little faith (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whenever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#960;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(hopou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3699.htm">Strong's 3699: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where, whither, in what place.
