This interaction is part of a larger dialogue where Jesus often challenges the Pharisees' understanding of the Law. Jesus frequently uses these opportunities to reveal deeper spiritual truths and to correct misunderstandings about God's intentions.<p><b>Moses wrote this commandment for you</b><br>Jesus refers to the Mosaic Law, specifically <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, which allowed for divorce. Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, provided laws that governed the Israelites' civil and religious life. This commandment was a concession to human weakness rather than a reflection of God's ideal for marriage. It highlights the difference between God's perfect will and His permissive will in response to human sinfulness.<p><b>because of your hardness of heart</b><br>The phrase "hardness of heart" indicates a spiritual stubbornness and resistance to God's will. In biblical context, a hardened heart is often associated with sin and rebellion against God, as seen in Pharaoh's resistance in Exodus. Jesus points out that the allowance for divorce was not part of God's original design for marriage but was permitted due to the people's unwillingness to fully embrace God's intentions. This underscores the need for a transformed heart, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, pointing to the necessity of the New Covenant and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees' question about divorce.

Our Lord here answers their question, <span class="cmt_word">For your</span> <span class="cmt_word">hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</span> He permitted (not commanded) them to put away their wives, lest dislike might turn to hatred. From the beginning God joined them in one indissoluble bend; but man's nature having become corrupt through sin, that sin changed and corrupted the institution, and so was the occasion of bills of divorcement, and polygamy. The Law of Moses put some restraint upon the freedom with which men had till then put away their wives; for thenceforth, a divorce could not take place until some legal steps had been taken, and a regular instrument had been drawn up; and this delay might often be the means of preventing a divorce which might otherwise have been effected in a moment of passion. Thus this legislation was adapted to the imperfect moral condition of the people, who were as yet quite unprepared for a higher moral code. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
