In the cultural context of the time, a synagogue leader was a respected figure, yet Jairus humbles himself before Jesus, indicating his belief in Jesus' authority and power. The urgency reflects the dire situation and the deep love a father has for his child. This act of pleading is reminiscent of other biblical figures who approached God with earnest petitions, such as Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10-11</a>.<p><b>&#8220;My little daughter is near death.</b><br>Jairus' reference to his "little daughter" emphasizes the personal and emotional nature of his plea. The term "little" suggests not only her young age but also the tender affection he holds for her. The mention of her being "near death" underscores the critical nature of the situation, creating a sense of urgency and desperation. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where individuals seek Jesus' help in life-threatening situations, such as the centurion's servant in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>.<p><b>Please come and place Your hands on her,</b><br>The request for Jesus to "place Your hands on her" reflects the common belief in the healing power of touch, which was prevalent in Jewish and Greco-Roman cultures. Laying on of hands was a traditional Jewish practice for blessing and healing, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a> and <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18</a>. This act symbolizes the transfer of power and blessing, and Jairus' request indicates his faith in Jesus' ability to heal through physical touch.<p><b>so that she will be healed and live.&#8221;</b><br>Jairus expresses his faith in Jesus' power to heal and restore life, demonstrating a belief in Jesus' divine authority over sickness and death. This expectation of healing and life is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus performs numerous miracles, affirming His role as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the coming of a healer and savior, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>. Jairus' faith is a testament to the belief that Jesus is the source of life, echoing <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a> where Jesus declares Himself the resurrection and the life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus.htm">Jairus</a></b><br>A synagogue leader, a man of significant religious standing in the Jewish community.
