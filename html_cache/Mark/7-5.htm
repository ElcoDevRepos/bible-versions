Their questioning of Jesus reflects their role as guardians of religious tradition and their concern over maintaining ritual purity. This encounter takes place in Galilee, where Jesus often taught, and highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities. The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the oral traditions, which they believed were as binding as the written Law of Moses.<p><b>&#8220;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders?</b><br>The "tradition of the elders" refers to the oral laws and interpretations developed by Jewish leaders over generations. These traditions were meant to safeguard the Law but often became burdensome. The Pharisees viewed these traditions as essential for maintaining holiness and purity. This question reveals their focus on external observance rather than the heart of the Law. The disciples' actions challenged the authority of these traditions, which were not part of the original Mosaic Law.<p><b>Instead, they eat with defiled hands.&#8221;</b><br>Eating with "defiled hands" refers to the ritual washing that was customary before meals, a practice not commanded in the Torah but developed as part of the oral tradition. This washing was symbolic of spiritual cleanliness. The Pharisees considered eating without this ritual as making one ceremonially unclean. Jesus' response to this accusation, found in the following verses, emphasizes the importance of inner purity over external rituals, aligning with Old Testament teachings such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, which criticizes empty worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and oral traditions.

It was probable that the Pharisees would use the stronger word in their question, equally probable that a transcriber might think it better to substitute that which was the more easily understood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The Law of Moses prohibited contact with many things deemed to be unclean; and if any one had touched them he was counted unclean, so that he might not approach the temple until he had cleansed himself by the washing prescribed in the Law; the design being that by means of these ceremonial and bodily washings the Jews might be awakened to the necessity of spiritual cleansing. Hence the Jews, and especially the Pharisees, who wished to be esteemed more righteous than others, placing their whole religion in these external ceremonies, frequently washed themselves before their meals, and even at their meals. At the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee we read that there were placed "six waterpots of stone (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)" for these purifying purposes; so that if any Jew had by accident come into contact with any unclean thing, and so had contracted any ceremonial impurity, he might remove it. This, however, was only a custom, and not a thing of legal obligation until it was exalted into a law by the Pharisees. Now, this punctilious observance of traditions by the Pharisees and other Jews yielded little or no religious profit; for it occupied their time with external purifications, and so drew away their attention from the duty of far greater moment - the cleansing of the soul from sin. They made clean "the outside of the cup and platter," but neglected the inward cleansing of the heart. Therefore our blessed Lord, who came to put an end to the old ceremonial law, and to these vain and frivolous traditions which now overlaid it, and who wished to direct all the care of his disciples to the making of the heart clean, cared not to enforce these external washings upon his disciples, although he did not say this in so many words to the Pharisees, lest he should provoke their envy and their malice. He therefore meets their question in another way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
