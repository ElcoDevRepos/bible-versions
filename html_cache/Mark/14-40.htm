The setting is the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of olive presses, symbolizing the pressing weight of the moment as Jesus faces His impending crucifixion. The disciples' sleep contrasts with Jesus' intense prayer and agony, emphasizing human weakness and the need for divine strength. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction that the disciples would fall away (<a href="/mark/14-27.htm">Mark 14:27</a>). It also reflects the spiritual lethargy that can afflict believers, urging vigilance in prayer (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>for their eyes were heavy</b><br>This phrase indicates physical exhaustion, likely due to the emotional strain of the events leading up to this moment, including the Last Supper and Jesus' predictions of betrayal and denial. The disciples' heaviness of eyes can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual dullness, a theme echoed in other parts of Scripture where spiritual alertness is called for (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>). The heaviness also underscores the humanity of the disciples, who, despite their best intentions, struggle with their limitations.<p><b>And they did not know what to answer Him</b><br>This phrase captures the disciples' confusion and shame. Their inability to respond to Jesus' question reflects their lack of understanding and preparedness for the events unfolding. It echoes earlier moments in the Gospels where the disciples are unable to grasp Jesus' teachings fully (<a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a>). This moment foreshadows Peter's later denial, highlighting the theme of human frailty and the need for redemption. The silence of the disciples can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, where the shepherd is struck, and the sheep scatter (<a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, experiencing deep anguish as He prays before His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically, Peter, James, and John, who were asked by Jesus to keep watch while He prayed.
