This phrase indicates the fulfillment of Jesus' command to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The early church's expansion is documented in the Book of Acts, where the apostles and other believers traveled extensively, sharing the message of Christ. This movement was not limited to Jewish communities but extended to Gentile regions, reflecting the universal scope of the gospel.<p><b>and the Lord worked through them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine partnership in the mission of the apostles. It is a reminder that the success of their ministry was not due to their own abilities but to the power and presence of the risen Christ. Jesus had promised to be with them always (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), and this was manifested through the Holy Spirit, who empowered them for service (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). The Lord's involvement underscores the theological truth that God is actively engaged in the world, working through His people to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>confirming His word by the signs that accompanied it</b><br>Signs and wonders served as divine validation of the apostles' message. In the biblical context, miracles often authenticated the messenger and the message, as seen in the ministries of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus performed miracles to demonstrate His authority and identity (<a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>). Similarly, the apostles' ability to perform signs was a testament to the truth of the gospel and the presence of God's kingdom. These signs included healing the sick, casting out demons, and other miraculous acts, as recorded in Acts. The purpose of these signs was not merely to amaze but to lead people to faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were commissioned to spread the Gospel.
