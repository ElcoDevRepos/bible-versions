In the context of first-century Judea, women often had limited means and opportunities, making her act even more significant. Her action is a demonstration of wholehearted devotion, reminiscent of the widow's offering in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>, where Jesus commends giving out of poverty rather than abundance. This phrase underscores the importance of intention and heart in acts of worship and service.<p><b>to anoint My body</b><br>Anointing was a common practice in ancient Jewish culture, often associated with preparing a body for burial. It was a sign of respect and honor, typically involving fragrant oils or perfumes. This act foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial, serving as a prophetic gesture. The anointing also connects to the Old Testament practice of anointing kings and priests, symbolizing Jesus' roles as the Anointed One, the Messiah (Christ), fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<p><b>in advance of My burial</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' awareness of His approaching death, which He had predicted multiple times (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:33-34). The woman's act is a preparation for His burial, which would occur shortly after His crucifixion. In Jewish tradition, bodies were typically anointed after death, but this preemptive anointing signifies the urgency and inevitability of His sacrifice. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as Jesus willingly embraces His role as the sacrificial Lamb, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being anointed in this passage.

She seized the opportunity, which might not occur again, of doing honor to her Lord by anointing him with her very best. Our Lord might have excused this action, and have praised it as a practical evidence of her gratitude, her humility, and her love for him. But instead of dwelling on these things, he said, <span class="cmt_word">She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying</span>. Our Lord here, of course, alludes to the spices and ointments with which the Jews wrapped up the bodies of their dead before their burial. Not that this was what Mary intended. She could hardly have dreamed of his death and burial so near at hand. But she was moved by the Holy Spirit to do this, at this particular time, as though in anticipation of his death and burial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">She has done</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
