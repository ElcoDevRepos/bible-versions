This setting is symbolic, as it is a place where Jesus often went to pray and teach. The Mount of Olives is also prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> as the location where the Lord will stand in the day of the Lord, indicating its eschatological importance. The temple, visible from this vantage point, represents the center of Jewish worship and religious life, making Jesus' teachings here particularly poignant as He discusses the future destruction of the temple and the end times.<p><b>Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,</b><br>These four disciples are part of Jesus' inner circle, with Peter, James, and John being particularly close to Him, as seen in other significant events like the Transfiguration (<a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>). Andrew, Peter's brother, is also included, highlighting his role among the disciples. The private nature of their inquiry suggests a desire for deeper understanding and insight into Jesus' teachings, reflecting their trust and the special relationship they have with Him. This moment of private questioning is reminiscent of other instances where Jesus provides deeper revelations to His disciples, such as in <a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-11</a>, where He explains the purpose of parables.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples about future events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his leadership among the apostles and his boldness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>Brother of John, one of the first disciples called by Jesus, and part of Jesus' inner circle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>Brother of James, also part of Jesus' inner circle, known for his deep spiritual insights.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/andrew.htm">Andrew</a></b><br>Brother of Peter, one of the first disciples to follow Jesus, known for bringing others to Christ.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A significant location in biblical prophecy and Jesus' ministry, situated east of Jerusalem, offering a view of the temple.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The center of Jewish worship in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_private_inquiry.htm">The Importance of Private Inquiry</a></b><br>The disciples approached Jesus privately, showing the value of seeking personal understanding and clarity in our spiritual walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_inner_circle.htm">The Role of the Inner Circle</a></b><br>Jesus often shared deeper insights with His closest disciples, reminding us of the importance of intimate fellowship and accountability in our faith journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_significance.htm">Prophetic Significance</a></b><br>The setting on the Mount of Olives underscores the prophetic nature of Jesus' teachings, encouraging believers to study and understand biblical prophecy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_for_future_events.htm">Preparedness for Future Events</a></b><br>Jesus' discourse on the end times calls us to be vigilant and spiritually prepared for His return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_place.htm">The Significance of Place</a></b><br>The Mount of Olives serves as a reminder of God's unfolding plan and the fulfillment of prophecy, encouraging us to trust in His sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_13_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 13:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_13_3_s_call_for_spiritual_vigilance.htm">How does Mark 13:3 encourage vigilance in our spiritual lives today?

St. Mark, going more into detail, gives the names of those who thus asked him; namely, Peter and James and John, already distinguished, and Andrew, who enjoyed the distinction of having been the first called. These men appear to have been our Lord's inner council; and they asked him (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) privately, or <span class="accented">separately</span>, not only from the multitude, but from the rest of the disciples. It was a dangerous thing to speak of the destruction of the temple, or even to inquire about such an event, for fear of the scribes and Pharisees. It was this accusation that led to the stoning of Stephen. It is evident from St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>) that the disciples closely associated together the destruction of the temple and his final coming at the end of the world. They knew from our Lord's words that the destruction of Jerusalem was near at hand, and therefore they thought that the destruction of the world itself, and the day of judgment, were also near at hand. Hence their questions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
