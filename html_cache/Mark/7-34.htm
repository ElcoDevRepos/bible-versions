In Jewish tradition, looking up to heaven is a gesture of prayer and seeking divine intervention. It reflects Jesus' reliance on God and His acknowledgment of divine authority. This act is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus prays or seeks guidance from the Father, such as in <a href="/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41-42</a> before raising Lazarus.<p><b>He sighed deeply</b><br>The deep sigh of Jesus can be seen as an expression of compassion and empathy for human suffering. It also reflects His frustration with the effects of sin and the fallen state of the world. This emotional response is similar to other moments in the Gospels where Jesus shows deep emotion, such as weeping at Lazarus' tomb (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>). It underscores His humanity and His deep care for individuals.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Ephphatha!&#8221;</b><br>"Ephphatha" is an Aramaic word, the language commonly spoken by Jesus and His contemporaries. The use of Aramaic here highlights the authenticity and historical context of the event. Jesus' command is direct and authoritative, demonstrating His power over physical ailments. This mirrors other instances where Jesus heals with a word, such as in <a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8-13</a> with the centurion's servant.<p><b>(which means, &#8220;Be opened!&#8221;)</b><br>The translation provided in the text ensures that the audience understands the significance of Jesus' command. The phrase "Be opened!" not only refers to the physical healing of the man's ears and tongue but also symbolizes spiritual openness and receptivity to God's word. This act of opening is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which prophesies the opening of the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf, pointing to the messianic age and the work of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing a miraculous healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deaf_and_mute_man.htm">The Deaf and Mute Man</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' healing, representing those in need of physical and spiritual restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/decapolis.htm">Decapolis</a></b><br>The region where this event took place, a group of ten cities with a significant Gentile population, highlighting Jesus' ministry beyond Jewish boundaries.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present as witnesses to the miracle, learning from Jesus' actions and teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Those who brought the deaf and mute man to Jesus, demonstrating faith and hope in Jesus' healing power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Jesus looking up to heaven signifies His reliance on the Father, reminding us to seek divine guidance in all we do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_suffering.htm">Compassion for the Suffering</a></b><br>Jesus' deep sigh reflects His empathy for human pain, encouraging us to show compassion to those in need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/power_of_the_word.htm">Power of the Word</a></b><br>The command "Ephphatha" demonstrates the authority of Jesus' word, reminding us of the transformative power of Scripture in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The healing in Decapolis shows that Jesus' ministry extends to all people, urging us to share the Gospel beyond our immediate circles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The crowd's initiative to bring the man to Jesus highlights the importance of active faith, motivating us to bring others to Christ for healing and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_7_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 7:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_command_Be_opened_shows_power.htm">How does Jesus' command "Be opened!" demonstrate His divine authority and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Faith_lessons_from_Mark_7_34_healing.htm">What can we learn about faith from the healing in Mark 7:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_34_and_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">How does Mark 7:34 connect to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Mark_7_34_compassion_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' compassion in Mark 7:34 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Jesus_open_our_lives_areas.htm">In what ways can we trust Jesus to "open" areas of our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_and_significance_of_Ephphatha.htm">What does "Ephphatha" mean in Mark 7:34, and why is it significant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_34_Jesus_divine_authority.htm">How does Mark 7:34 demonstrate Jesus' divine authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_actions_in_Mark_7_34_miracle.htm">Why did Jesus use physical actions in Mark 7:34 to perform a miracle?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'ephphatha'_mean.htm">What does "Ephphatha" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/when_will_satan's_defeat_occur.htm">What does 'Ephphatha' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/which_language_did_jesus_speak.htm">Which language did Jesus speak?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'talitha_cumi'_mean.htm">What does "Talitha Cumi" mean in English?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Mark 7:34 Mean</div><b>And looking up to heaven</b><p>&#8226;

We know indeed that he was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;" but now we might almost have expected a momentary smile of loving joy when he was about to give back to this afflicted man the use of these valuable instruments of thought and action. But he sighed even then; for he was touched with the feeling of human infirmity, and no doubt his comprehensive eye would take in the vast amount of misery, both bodily and spiritual, which has come upon the world through sin; and this, too, immediately after having looked up to heaven, and thought of the realm of bliss which for a time he had left "for us men, and for our salvation." <span class="accented">Ephphatha</span>, <span class="accented">that is</span>, <span class="accented">Be opened.</span> This word is, of course, addressed to the man himself; and the evangelist has retained the original Syro-Chaldaic word, as he has retained "Talitha cumi" elsewhere: so that the actual word which passed through the Saviour's lips, and restored speech and hearing to the afflicted, might be handed on, as doubtless it will be, to the end of time.
