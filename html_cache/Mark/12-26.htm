The Sadducees, a Jewish sect, did not believe in the resurrection of the dead, angels, or spirits, focusing only on the Torah. Jesus challenges their understanding by affirming the resurrection, a core belief in Christian doctrine, which is also supported by other scriptures such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>.<p><b>have you not read about the burning bush</b><br>Jesus refers to the account in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, where God speaks to Moses from the burning bush. This event is significant as it marks God's revelation to Moses and the beginning of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. The burning bush symbolizes God's presence and holiness, and Jesus uses this familiar story to make a theological point about life after death.<p><b>in the Book of Moses</b><br>The "Book of Moses" refers to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to Moses. By citing the Pentateuch, Jesus uses the Sadducees' own authoritative texts to argue for the resurrection, demonstrating that their understanding of scripture is incomplete.<p><b>how God told him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the direct communication between God and Moses, highlighting the authority and authenticity of the message. It underscores the personal relationship God has with His people, which transcends death.<p><b>&#8216;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;</b><br>God's declaration to Moses indicates that He is the God of the living, not the dead. By using the present tense "I am," Jesus points out that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive to God, supporting the concept of life after death. This statement connects to the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, which are fulfilled in Christ, who is the resurrection and the life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the New Testament, who is teaching and correcting the Sadducees in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect that denied the resurrection of the dead, which Jesus addresses in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A prophet and leader in Israel's history, through whom God delivered the Israelites from Egypt.

The promise anticipates resurrection bodies, not merely disembodied existence, fulfilling God&#8217;s purposes for His people (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus uses <a href="/bsb/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> to prove resurrection. By highlighting God&#8217;s present-tense covenant with the patriarchs, He demonstrates that those who die in faith remain alive to Him and will rise bodily. Scripture&#8217;s authority, God&#8217;s unchanging character, and the continuity of His promises converge to assure believers that death cannot sever the relationship sealed by the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">How</span> <span class= "bld">in the bush God spake unto him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">at the bush, how God spake to him.</span> The reference to the bush, not given by St. Matthew, is common both to St. Mark and St. Luke, and the order of the words in the Greek of both shows that they point to "the bush," not as the place in which God spoke, but as the title or heading by which the section Exodus 3 was commonly described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - St. Mark is here careful to state that what St. Matthew describes as "the word spoken by God" was to be found <span class="cmt_word">in the book of Moses</span> (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>), in the place concerning <span class="cmt_word">the Bush</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), as it is correctly rendered in the Revised Version. Our Lord might have brought yet clearer proofs out of Job, Daniel, Ezekiel, etc.; but in his wisdom he preferred to allege this out of Moses and the Pentateuch, because, whatever the views of the Sadducees may have been as to other parts of the Old Testament, these books of Moses they readily acknowledged. <span class="cmt_word">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</span>. The force of the argument is this, that "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." Their souls are still alive; and if these patriarchs are still alive, there will be a resurrection. If men are to live for ever, they will, sooner or later, live again in the completeness of their being, namely, of body and soul and spirit. Our Lord would, therefore, say this: "In a few days you will put me to death; but in three days I shall rise again from the dead. And after that, in due time I shall raise them from the dead at the last day, and bring them in triumph with me into heaven." The Sadducees and the Epicureans denied the resurrection, because they denied the immortality of the soul; for these two doctrines hang together. For if the soul is immortal, then, since it naturally depends upon the body, it is necessary that the body should rise. Otherwise the soul would continue to exist in a dislocated state, and would only obtain a divided life and an imperfect existence. Hence our Lord here distinctly proves the resurrection of the body from the immortality of the soul. When he speaks of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he does not speak of their souls only, but of their whole being. Therefore, though they are for a time dead to us, yet they live to God, and sleep, as it were, because ere long God will raise them from death, as from a sleep, to a blessed and endless life. For all, though they have passed out of our sight, still live to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">regarding</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
