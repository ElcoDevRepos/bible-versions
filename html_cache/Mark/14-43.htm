The setting is the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of prayer and reflection, now turned into a scene of betrayal and arrest.<p><b>Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived</b><br>Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' chosen apostles, plays the role of the betrayer. His identity as "one of the Twelve" underscores the gravity of his betrayal, as he was part of Jesus' inner circle. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the Messiah. Judas' actions are a stark reminder of the potential for betrayal even among those closest to us.<p><b>accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and clubs</b><br>The crowd accompanying Judas was likely a mix of Roman soldiers and temple guards, indicating the seriousness with which the authorities viewed Jesus. The mention of "swords and clubs" suggests preparation for resistance, though Jesus had shown no inclination towards violence. This reflects the misunderstanding and fear surrounding Jesus' mission and the threat He posed to the established religious order.<p><b>sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders</b><br>These groups represented the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. Their involvement shows the official nature of the arrest and the religious leaders' determination to eliminate Jesus. The chief priests, scribes, and elders were key figures in maintaining religious law and order, and their opposition to Jesus was rooted in His challenge to their authority and interpretation of the law.

It was so startling a fact that "one of the twelve" should be the betrayer of cur Lord, that this designation of Judas became linked with his name: "Judas, one of the twelve." He comes not only as a thief and a robber, but also as a traitor; the leader of those who were thirsting for Christ's blood. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/22-47.htm">Luke 22:47</a>) says that Judas "went before them," in his eagerness to accomplish his hateful errand. And with him a multitude (not a great multitude; the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> has not sufficient authority). But though not a great multitude, they would be a considerable number. There would be a band of soldiers; and there would be civil officers sent by the Sanhedrim. Thus Gentiles and Jews were united in the daring act of arresting the Son of God.
