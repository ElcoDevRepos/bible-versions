This reply is significant as it highlights Jesus' teaching method, often using questions to provoke thought and deeper understanding. His response is not dismissive but rather an invitation to consider a broader spiritual truth. Jesus frequently used questions to challenge prevailing assumptions and to lead His listeners to a deeper understanding of His mission and the nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;Who are My mother and My brothers?&#8221;</b><br>This question challenges the traditional Jewish understanding of family ties, which were deeply rooted in blood relations and tribal affiliations. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, family was central to one's identity and social structure. By asking this question, Jesus is redefining the concept of family in spiritual terms. He emphasizes that spiritual kinship, based on obedience to God's will, transcends biological relationships. This teaching aligns with other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, where believers are described as children of God, born not of natural descent but of God. Additionally, this redefinition of family foreshadows the formation of the early Christian community, where believers are united as brothers and sisters in Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. Jesus' question also points to His role as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, who would establish a new covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching and responding to those around Him.

His earthly family is standing outside, trying to pull Him away, yet He answers the messenger instead of immediately stepping out. That reply signals something important: whenever Jesus speaks, He reveals the will of the Father (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<p>&#8226; The conjunction &#8220;But&#8221; shows a contrast&#8212;human expectations versus divine priorities (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is not dismissive; He is deliberate. Like at Cana&#8212;&#8220;Woman, why does this concern us?&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>)&#8212;He redirects attention from natural ties to the mission of God.<p>&#8226; He models the call to seek first the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>) even when family pressures mount (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who are My mother</b><p>He begins with the most honored earthly bond. In Israel, honoring mother and father is a core command (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), yet Jesus asks a question that unsettles mere biology.<p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical, inviting listeners to look around and discover a deeper, spiritual motherhood rooted in faith and obedience (<a href="/luke/11-27.htm">Luke 11:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; He does not deny Mary&#8217;s blessed role (<a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>); He magnifies the greater blessing of hearing and doing God&#8217;s word (<a href="/luke/8-21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Even if earthly family fails, God provides a covenant family (<a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and My brothers?</b><p>The sentence widens to include siblings&#8212;representing the broader circle of kinship.

For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-34.htm">Mark 3:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual kinship is defined by obedience, not ancestry (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; This family is expansive: all who trust Christ are called His &#8220;brothers&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>), sharing His inheritance (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Following Jesus may cost natural relationships (<a href="/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29-30</a>), but He supplies a hundredfold in the fellowship of believers (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>By asking, &#8220;Who are My mother and My brothers?&#8221; Jesus elevates spiritual relationship above bloodline. He honors family yet insists that true kinship is forged by doing the Father&#8217;s will.
