The act of bringing the paralytic to Jesus demonstrates faith in His ability to heal, reflecting the belief that Jesus had divine authority. This moment foreshadows the spiritual healing Jesus offers, as physical healing often symbolizes spiritual restoration in the Gospels.<p><b>carried by four men</b><br>The four men represent the community's role in supporting those in need, highlighting the importance of faith in action. Their determination to bring the paralytic to Jesus, despite obstacles, underscores the communal aspect of faith and the belief in Jesus' power to heal. This act of carrying the paralytic can be seen as a type of intercession, where believers bring others to Christ through prayer and support. The number four may symbolize completeness, indicating a full effort to bring the man to Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching with authority.

Here again the minuteness of detail is very observable. It is also interesting to notice how the three writers of the synoptic Gospels supplement and illustrate one another. St. Matthew gives the outline, St. Mark and St. Luke fill up the picture. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/5-18.htm">Luke 5:18</a>) tells us how they sought means to bring the paralytic into Christ's presence. They carried him on his bed up the flight of steps outside the house, and reaching to the roof; and then both St. Mark and St. Luke tell us how, having first removed a portion of the tiling and broken up the roof, they then let him down through the opening thus made into the midst before Jesus. The chamber into which he was thus abruptly lowered was most probably what is elsewhere called the "upper chamber," a large central room, convenient for the purpose of addressing both those who filled it and also the crowd that thronged the outer court below. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a paralytic</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(paralytikon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3885.htm">Strong's 3885: </a> </span><span class="str2">Afflicted with paralysis.
