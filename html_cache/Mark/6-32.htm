The use of a boat suggests the geographical context of the Sea of Galilee, a central location in Jesus' ministry. Boats were common for transportation and fishing, highlighting the disciples' background as fishermen. This withdrawal reflects a pattern in Jesus' ministry of seeking solitude for rest and prayer, as seen in other passages like <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a> and <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>.<p><b>by themselves</b><br>The emphasis on "by themselves" underscores the need for privacy and rest for Jesus and His disciples. This moment of retreat follows a period of intense ministry, including the sending out of the Twelve and the feeding of the five thousand. It highlights the importance of rest and reflection in spiritual life, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a> with the Sabbath rest.<p><b>to a solitary place</b><br>The "solitary place" signifies a location away from the bustling crowds, often associated with wilderness or deserted areas. This setting is significant in biblical narratives, often serving as a place of testing, revelation, or divine encounter, as seen in the experiences of Moses, Elijah, and John the Baptist. It also foreshadows the solitude Jesus would seek in Gethsemane before His crucifixion. The solitary place provides a backdrop for spiritual renewal and preparation for future ministry challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is leading His disciples to a place of rest and solitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who are accompanying Him on this journey to a solitary place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>- The means of transportation used by Jesus and His disciples to reach the solitary place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solitary_place.htm">Solitary Place</a></b><br>- A location away from the crowds, intended for rest and reflection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>- Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the reason for seeking solitude, as they often followed Jesus and His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest_and_solitude.htm">The Importance of Rest and Solitude</a></b><br>Jesus models the need for rest and withdrawal from the busyness of life to recharge spiritually and physically.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intentional_retreat_for_spiritual_renewal.htm">Intentional Retreat for Spiritual Renewal</a></b><br>Solitude is not just about physical rest but also about spiritual renewal and communion with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_ministry_and_personal_time.htm">Balancing Ministry and Personal Time</a></b><br>Even in the midst of active ministry, Jesus prioritized time away from the crowds, teaching us to balance service with personal time with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/following_jesus'_example.htm">Following Jesus' Example</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we should emulate His practice of seeking solitude to strengthen our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_human_limitations.htm">Recognizing Human Limitations</a></b><br>Acknowledging our need for rest and solitude is a recognition of our human limitations and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_6_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 6:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_32_Seek_solitude_for_renewal.htm">How does Mark 6:32 inspire us to seek solitude for spiritual renewal today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_solitary_retreats.htm">What can we learn from Jesus' example of retreating to a "solitary place"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Mark_6_32_Psalm_23_2_on_God_s_rest.htm">How does Mark 6:32 connect with Psalm 23:2 about finding rest in God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_balance_ministry_work_and_rest.htm">Why is it important to balance ministry work with rest, as seen in Mark 6:32?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_solitude_in_busy_lives.htm">How can we implement regular times of solitude in our busy modern lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_seek_solitude_in_Mark_6_32.htm">Why did Jesus choose solitude in Mark 6:32 instead of addressing the crowd immediately?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_32_Jesus_rest_and_self-care.htm">What does Mark 6:32 reveal about Jesus' approach to rest and self-care?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_32_Rethink_leadership_roles.htm">How does Mark 6:32 challenge our understanding of leadership and responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_distinguishes_judaism_from_islam.htm">Is forgiveness withheld if we don't forgive others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/disciples'_reaction_to_jesus_walking_on_water.htm">How did the disciples react when Jesus walked on water?

It seems that there were two places called Bethsaida - one in Galilee proper, and the other to the north-east of the Sea of Galilee. It was to the neighborhood of this latter place that our Lord here directs the boat to take him. The other Bethsaida is mentioned lower down at Ver. 45. The word Bethsaida means the "fish village." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they went away</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
