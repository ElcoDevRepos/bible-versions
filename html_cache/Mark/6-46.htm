Jesus had just performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000, a significant event that demonstrated His compassion and divine provision. The act of bidding farewell shows Jesus' intentionality in His actions, as He often withdrew from the crowds and even His disciples to seek solitude and communion with the Father. This separation underscores the importance of personal time with God, even amidst ministry demands.<p><b>He went up on the mountain</b><br>Mountains in biblical times were often seen as places of revelation and divine encounter. They symbolize a place set apart for meeting with God, as seen in the experiences of Moses on Mount Sinai and Elijah on Mount Carmel. The geographical setting of a mountain also provided a physical separation from the distractions below, allowing for focused prayer and reflection. This act of ascending a mountain can be seen as a type of Jesus' future ascension into heaven, where He continues to intercede for believers.<p><b>to pray</b><br>Prayer was central to Jesus' life and ministry, serving as a model for His followers. This moment of prayer highlights Jesus' dependence on the Father and His commitment to seeking God's will. It reflects the intimate relationship within the Trinity and the necessity of prayer in sustaining spiritual strength and guidance. This act of prayer also connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus prays before significant events, such as choosing the twelve apostles or before His crucifixion, emphasizing the importance of prayer in preparation for pivotal moments in life and ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as taking time away from the crowds and His disciples to engage in prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the ones Jesus bids farewell to before He goes to pray.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>A place of solitude and elevation, often used in Scripture as a setting for significant spiritual encounters and revelations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communication with God, which Jesus prioritizes even amidst His busy ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_solitude_in_prayer.htm">The Importance of Solitude in Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus models the necessity of withdrawing from daily activities to focus on prayer.

Both the evangelists desire to call attention to the fact that, when night came on, the disciples were alone in their boat and Jesus alone on the land. It was nightfall; and St. John informs us that "the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew." Then it was that the Lord left his place of prayer on the mountain, and walked upon the sea, that he might succor his disciples now distressed by the storm. It would appear that our Lord had been obliged to use a little pressure to induce his disciples to leave him: "He constrained them (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And when he had sent them away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) - more literally, had taken leave of them, that is, the multitude - he departed into a mountain (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">literally, into the mountain</span>; that is, the high table-land at the foot of which the multitude had been fed.

Our Lord did this that he might teach us in our prayers to shun the crowd, and to pray in silence and in secret, with collected mind. There is here, too, a special example for the clergy, namely, this: that when they have preached they should go apart and pray that God would make effectual that which they have delivered; that he would himself give the increase where they have planted and watered, and renew their spiritual strength, that they may return again to their labour refreshed by communion with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After bidding them farewell,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apotaxamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_657.htm">Strong's 657: </a> </span><span class="str2">To withdraw from, take leave of, renounce, send away. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">up on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
