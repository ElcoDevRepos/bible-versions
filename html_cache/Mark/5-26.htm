The woman's suffering under their care highlights the limitations of human wisdom and the desperation of her situation. This phrase underscores the physical and emotional toll of her condition, as well as the societal stigma attached to her illness, which would have rendered her ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>). Her experience reflects the broader human condition of suffering and the inadequacy of earthly solutions, setting the stage for the divine intervention of Jesus.<p><b>and had spent all she had,</b><br>The financial ruin of the woman emphasizes the costliness of seeking healing and the futility of her efforts. In the ancient world, medical treatment was often expensive, and her depletion of resources signifies her desperation and the depth of her need. This mirrors the spiritual bankruptcy of humanity without Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>, which invites those who are spiritually impoverished to come to God for true sustenance.<p><b>but to no avail.</b><br>This phrase captures the hopelessness of her situation, as all her efforts and resources have yielded no improvement. It highlights the theme of human helplessness apart from divine intervention, a recurring motif in the Gospels. The futility of her attempts at healing serves as a backdrop for the miraculous power of Jesus, who offers what the world cannot provide.<p><b>Instead, her condition had only grown worse.</b><br>The worsening of her condition despite her efforts underscores the progressive nature of sin and suffering in a fallen world. It also sets the stage for the transformative power of Jesus' healing, which not only addresses physical ailments but also restores individuals to wholeness. This phrase foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who reverses the curse of sin and brings about spiritual and physical restoration, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which prophesies the healing brought by the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with
