It reflects His method of engaging His audience through questions, prompting them to think deeply about spiritual truths. Jesus often used questions to lead His listeners to self-reflection and understanding, a common rabbinic technique of the time.<p><b>&#8220;To what can we compare the kingdom of God?</b><br>The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and reign. This question invites the audience to consider the nature and characteristics of God's kingdom. In the Jewish context, the kingdom was often associated with the hope of a messianic age, a time of peace and divine rule. Jesus' question challenges traditional expectations, encouraging His listeners to see the kingdom in a new light.<p><b>With what parable shall we present it?</b><br>Parables were a common teaching tool in ancient Jewish culture, used to convey complex truths through simple, relatable stories. By choosing to use a parable, Jesus is making the kingdom of God accessible to all, regardless of their level of understanding. This method also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God speaks of people hearing but not understanding, seeing but not perceiving, highlighting the dual purpose of parables to reveal and conceal truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd through parables.

Our Lord thus stimulates the intellect of his hearers, by making them his associates, as it were, in the search for appropriate similitudes (see Dr. Morison, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The kingdom of God, that is, his Church on earth, is <span class="cmt_word">like a grain of mustard seed</span>. By this image our Lord shows the great power, fertility, and extension of the Church; inasmuch as it started from a very small and apparently insignificant beginning, and spread itself over the whole world. It is not literally and absolutely true that the grain of mustard seed is less than all seeds. There are other seeds which are less than it. But the expression may readily be allowed when we compare the smallness of the seed with the greatness of the results produced by it. It is one of the least of all seeds. And so the preaching of the Gospel and the establishment of the Church was one of the smallest of beginnings. Perhaps the well-known pungency of the seed of the mustard plant may suggest the quickening, stimulating power of the Gospel when it takes root in the heart. The mustard plant shoots out large branches, which are used as fuel in some countries, quite large enough for shadow for the birds. A traveler in South America says that it grows to so large a tree upon the slopes of the mountains of Chili that he could ride under its branches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He asked,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
