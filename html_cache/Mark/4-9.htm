The setting is by the Sea of Galilee, where large crowds gathered to hear Him. This introduction underscores the authority of Jesus as a teacher and prophet, echoing the Old Testament prophets who often began their messages with a divine declaration.<p><b>&#8220;He who has ears to hear,</b><br>This phrase is a call to discernment and understanding. In biblical times, hearing was not just a physical act but also a metaphor for spiritual perception and obedience. The phrase suggests that not everyone will understand or accept the message, highlighting the distinction between those open to God's truth and those who are not. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not understand, a theme Jesus often revisits in His teachings.<p><b>let him hear.&#8221;</b><br>This is an invitation to actively listen and respond. It implies that hearing involves more than just auditory reception; it requires a willingness to act on what is heard. In the broader biblical narrative, hearing is linked to faith and obedience, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes by hearing the word of Christ. This call to hear is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, urging His listeners to embrace the kingdom of God with open hearts and minds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowd using parables.

Our Lord uses this expression, "he that hath ears to hear," etc, when the subject-matter is figurative or obscure, as though to rouse the attention of his hearers. He has "ears to hear" who diligently attends to the words of Christ, that he may ponder and obey them. Many heard him out of curiosity, that they might bear something new, or learned, or brilliant; not that they might lay to heart the things which they heard, and endeavor to practice them in their lives. And so it is with those who go to hear sermons on account of the fame of the preacher, and not that they may learn to amend their lives; and thus the words of Jehovah to Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a>) are fulfilled, "And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
