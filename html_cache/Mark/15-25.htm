The precision of this timing underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial systems, pointing to Jesus as the Lamb of God. This hour also marks the beginning of the crucifixion process, setting the stage for the events that would unfold over the next six hours.<p><b>when they crucified Him</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most heinous criminals and was designed to be a public, humiliating, and excruciatingly painful death. The act of crucifying Jesus fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. The crucifixion took place outside the city walls of Jerusalem, likely at a site known as Golgotha, meaning "Place of the Skull." This location was chosen to serve as a deterrent to others, as it was visible to many passersby. The crucifixion of Jesus is central to Christian theology, representing the atonement for humanity's sins and the ultimate act of love and obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the crucifixion, the Son of God, who is being crucified for the sins of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The executors of the crucifixion, responsible for carrying out the sentence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was crucified, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_hour.htm">The Third Hour</a></b><br>Refers to the time of day, approximately 9 a.m., when Jesus was crucified.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion.htm">Crucifixion</a></b><br>A Roman method of execution, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus for mankind's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_timing_of_god's_plan.htm">The Timing of God's Plan</a></b><br>The specific mention of the "third hour" underscores the precision and intentionality of God's redemptive plan.

The third hour would literally be nine o'clock. But we gather from ver. 33 that our Lord was on his cross, and still alive, at the sixth hour, that is, at twelve o'clock. The simplest mode of solving the chronological difficulty seems to be this: The Jews divided their day into four parts, which they called hours, namely, the first, from six to nine; the third, from nine to twelve; the sixth, from twelve to three; and the ninth, from three to six. It was, then, within the third hour, that is, between nine and twelve, that they crucified him; and it was from the sixth to the ninth hour that he was actually upon his cross.
