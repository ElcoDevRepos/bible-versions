The man represents Jesus Himself, who is preparing to leave His disciples and ascend to heaven. The journey signifies Jesus' departure from the earth after His resurrection, highlighting the period between His ascension and His second coming. This imagery is consistent with other parables where a master leaves and later returns, such as in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, emphasizing the importance of readiness and stewardship.<p><b>who left his house</b><br>The house symbolizes the church or the community of believers. In biblical times, a house was not just a physical structure but a center of family and community life. Jesus, as the head of the church, entrusts His followers with the responsibility of maintaining and growing His spiritual household in His physical absence. This reflects the trust and authority given to the disciples and, by extension, to all believers.<p><b>put each servant in charge of his own task</b><br>This phrase underscores the concept of individual responsibility and stewardship. Each servant is given a specific task, indicating that every believer has a unique role and purpose within the body of Christ. This aligns with Paul's teachings in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where he describes the church as a body with many parts, each having its own function. The emphasis is on faithfulness and diligence in fulfilling one's God-given duties.<p><b>and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch</b><br>The doorkeeper represents those who are particularly tasked with vigilance and alertness, possibly alluding to leaders within the church who are responsible for spiritual oversight. The instruction to keep watch is a call to be spiritually alert and prepared for the return of Christ. This theme of watchfulness is echoed throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>, where believers are urged to be awake and sober, anticipating the Lord's return. The doorkeeper's role is crucial, as it involves protecting the household and ensuring readiness for the master's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_going_on_a_journey.htm">The Man Going on a Journey</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who ascended to heaven and will return at an unknown time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Church or the Kingdom of God on earth, where believers are called to serve.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Represents believers who are entrusted with various responsibilities and spiritual gifts to serve the Church and the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_doorkeeper.htm">The Doorkeeper</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who are specifically tasked with vigilance and readiness, possibly leaders or those with a prophetic role.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>Represents the period between Christ's ascension and His second coming, a time of active service and watchfulness for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_gifts.htm">Stewardship of Gifts</a></b><br>Each believer has been given specific tasks and spiritual gifts.

After His resurrection, the Lord was &#8220;taken up into heaven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>), but He did not abandon His people; rather, He &#8220;went to prepare a place&#8221; and will &#8220;come again&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>). The journey stresses:<p>&#8226; His physical absence is real, yet temporary.<p>&#8226; Our current season is one of stewardship and anticipation, not idleness.<p>&#8226; The certainty of His return motivates faithful living (<a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who left his house</b><p>The &#8220;house&#8221; represents the household of God&#8212;His covenant people.

Their absence, seeming, as they do, essential to the meaning of the sentence, is singular. A possible explanation is, that we have an imperfect fragmentary report, as from a note taken at the time, of that which appears, in a developed form, as the parable of the Talents in <a href="/context/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.">Matthew 25:14-30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And commanded the porter to watch.</span>--This feature is unique in our Lord's parables, and, as such, seems to call for a special interpretation. The "servants" we accept at once as the disciples, and we understand generally what was the authority and the work assigned to them. But who was specifically the "gate-keeper" or "porter"? The answer appears to be found in the promise of the keys of the kingdom that had been made to St. Peter (<a href="/matthew/16-19.htm" title="And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 16:19</a>). It was his work to open the door of that kingdom wide, to be ready for his Lord's coming in any of those manifold senses which experience would unfold to him. We may accordingly venture to trace in St. Mark's record, here as elsewhere, the influence of the Apostle. That word "the porter" was, he felt, meant for him, and this he remembered when much that had been recorded by others had faded from his recollection.
