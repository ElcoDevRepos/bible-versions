The first day of the week is Sunday, marking the day after the Sabbath. This timing is crucial as it signifies the beginning of a new creation, paralleling the creation narrative in Genesis. The resurrection occurring on this day also establishes the Christian tradition of Sunday worship, distinguishing it from the Jewish Sabbath observance on Saturday.<p><b>after Jesus had risen</b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. It confirms Jesus' victory over sin and death, validating His divine nature and the truth of His teachings. The resurrection is also a type of firstfruits, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, symbolizing the future resurrection of believers.<p><b>He appeared first to Mary Magdalene</b><br>Mary Magdalene's role as the first witness to the resurrected Christ is significant. In a cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued, her encounter underscores the transformative nature of the Gospel, which elevates the status of women. Her presence at the tomb is consistent with her devotion to Jesus, as seen in <a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2-3</a>, where she is listed among the women who supported His ministry.<p><b>from whom He had driven out seven demons</b><br>This detail highlights the transformative power of Jesus' ministry. The number seven often symbolizes completeness in biblical literature, suggesting the totality of her deliverance. Mary's deliverance from demonic possession is a testament to Jesus' authority over spiritual forces, as seen in other exorcisms throughout the Gospels.

The history of the verses that follow is in every way remarkable. They are not found in two of the oldest MSS.--the Sinaitic and the Vatican--are marked as doubtful in many others, and are wanting in some versions. In some of these (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the Vatican MS.) there is a blank space left between <a href="/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a> and the beginning of St. Luke, as though the writer had suspended his work and waited for materials. The absence was noticed by Jerome, who says that "nearly all the Greek texts omit them." Eusebius states the same fact as true of "the correct MSS.;" and no reference is made to them in the tables of parallel passages which were constructed for reference by Eusebius and Ammonius. On the other hand, they are referred to by Irenaeus (about A.D. 170), and are found in the Alexandrian and Cambridge MSS., and in twelve other uncials which are nearly (some say, quite) as old as the two which omit them. When we turn to the internal evidence we find that the narrative, which up to this point had followed closely in the footsteps of St. Matthew, now becomes a very condensed epitome of St. John's record of our Lord's appearance to Mary Magdalene (<a href="/context/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11-18</a>), of St. Luke's account of the journey to Emmaus (<a href="/context/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13-35</a>), of the appearance to the ten disciples in <a href="/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-25</a> and <a href="/context/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36-43</a>, of the mission of the eleven reported in <a href="/context/matthew/28-16.htm" title="Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.">Matthew 28:16-20</a>, of the Ascension as given by <a href="/context/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50-53</a>. Two explanations of these facts are possible. (1) We may suppose that the writer of the Gospel wrote two copies of it, leaving one unfinished, ending at <a href="/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a>; that this passed into the hands of persons by whom it was copied as complete, and so became the archetype of the MSS. in which the verses are wanting; while those that contain the subsequent verses were made from a more perfect text, written by St. Mark himself. (2) That the Gospel, having been originally completed by the writer, was in some way, by accident or design, mutilated; that as such it was reproduced faithfully by some transcribers, while others thought it better to give it a completion of some kind, by condensing what they found in the other Gospels. Of the two hypotheses the latter seems the more probable. It seems better, looking to these facts, to reserve notes, for the most part, for the Gospels in which the narratives appear in what was probably their original and certainly their fuller form. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils</span>.
