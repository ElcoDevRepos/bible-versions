The title "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah," which is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-26</a>. The term "King of Israel" acknowledges Jesus' royal lineage as a descendant of David, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. The demand for Jesus to come down from the cross is a test of His divine power and authority, similar to Satan's temptations in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). This challenge is ironic because Jesus' mission was to save humanity through His sacrifice, not by avoiding it.<p><b>so that we may see and believe!</b><br>This statement highlights the misunderstanding of faith by the onlookers. Biblical faith is not based on seeing miracles but on trusting God's promises (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). The demand for a sign echoes the Pharisees' earlier requests for a sign from Jesus (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38-39</a>). True belief in Jesus comes from understanding His teachings and recognizing His fulfillment of prophecy, not merely witnessing miraculous acts. This moment underscores the spiritual blindness of those who witnessed Jesus' ministry yet failed to recognize Him as the Messiah.<p><b>And even those who were crucified with Him berated Him.</b><br>This refers to the two criminals crucified alongside Jesus. Initially, both mocked Him, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a>. However, <a href="/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39-43</a> provides additional insight, revealing that one of the criminals later repented and asked Jesus to remember him in His kingdom. This change of heart demonstrates the transformative power of Jesus' presence and the possibility of redemption even at the last moment. The mockery from the criminals also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7-8</a>, which describes the suffering servant being scorned by those around Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>Referred to as "the Christ, the King of Israel," Jesus is the central figure in this passage, enduring crucifixion and mockery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The instrument of Roman execution, symbolizing suffering and sacrifice, where Jesus was crucified.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mockers.htm">The Mockers</a></b><br>Those who taunted Jesus, including religious leaders and passersby, challenging Him to prove His divinity by coming down from the cross.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucified_criminals.htm">The Crucified Criminals</a></b><br>Two individuals crucified alongside Jesus, one of whom also mocked Him, as noted in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of the crucifixion, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_faith.htm">The Nature of True Faith</a></b><br>True faith does not demand signs or miracles but trusts in God's plan and timing.

So he despised the taunts of the wicked, that he might teach us by his example to do the same. If he had chosen to descend from the cross, he would not have ascended. He knew that the death upon the cross was necessary for the salvation of men; and therefore he would go through the whole. He withheld the exercise of his power. His omnipotence restrained the natural longings of his suffering humanity to escape from these unutterable torments. So he would not come down from the cross, although within three days he would rise from the grave. And yet there was no word of indignation against his tormentors. On the contrary, he proclaimed mercy; for as he hung on his cross he said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Let} the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
