This miracle occurs in the region of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities with a significant Gentile population, showcasing Jesus' ministry extending beyond Jewish boundaries. The opening of the man's ears symbolizes spiritual awakening and the ability to hear God's word, reflecting prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the deaf hearing as a sign of the Messiah's coming.<p><b>and his tongue was released</b><br>The phrase "his tongue was released" indicates a physical and spiritual liberation. In biblical times, speech impediments were often seen as a sign of spiritual bondage or demonic influence. Jesus' healing act demonstrates His power over physical ailments and spiritual oppression. This miracle parallels the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the mute will shout for joy, further affirming Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies.<p><b>and he began to speak plainly</b><br>The ability to "speak plainly" signifies not only the restoration of physical faculties but also the clarity and truth that come from encountering Christ. In a cultural context where clear communication was vital for community and worship, this healing restores the man's social and religious participation.

Jesus literally fulfills that prophecy, confirming His messianic identity (<a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical hearing points to spiritual reality. Jesus often cried, &#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-23.htm">Mark 4:23</a>). Opening ears prefigures hearts awakened to receive the gospel (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle validates that every part of creation&#8212;body and spirit&#8212;answers to the Creator&#8217;s voice (<a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his tongue was released</b><p>The man had been &#8220;unable to speak clearly&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-32.htm">Mark 7:32</a>).
