In biblical context, it reflects the regularity and constancy of God's creation. The farmer's routine of sleeping and waking symbolizes human limitations and dependence on God's providence. This mirrors <a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, which speaks of God granting sleep to those He loves, highlighting trust in God's provision. The cycle of night and day also recalls <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God establishes the order of creation, underscoring His sovereignty over time and nature.<p><b>and the seed sprouts and grows</b><br>The imagery of the seed sprouting and growing is a common biblical metaphor for spiritual growth and the Kingdom of God. In the parable context, it illustrates the mysterious and autonomous nature of the Kingdom's expansion. This growth process is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>, where God's word is likened to rain and snow that nourish the earth, ensuring it yields a harvest. The seed's growth without human intervention points to the divine power at work in the world, much like the unseen work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.<p><b>though he knows not how</b><br>This phrase highlights human ignorance and the mystery of God's work. The farmer's lack of understanding about the growth process underscores the theme of faith and trust in God's unseen hand. It reflects <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, which speaks of the mystery of God's works in creation. This mystery is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the Kingdom of God as a hidden treasure or a pearl of great value (<a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>), emphasizing that the full understanding of God's Kingdom is beyond human comprehension. The phrase invites believers to trust in God's wisdom and timing, acknowledging that His ways are higher than ours (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents anyone who shares the Word of God.
