Fish was a staple in the diet of people living around the Sea of Galilee, where this event likely took place. The small fish, possibly sardines or similar, were common in the region and often dried or salted for preservation. This detail emphasizes the scarcity of resources and sets the stage for the miraculous provision that follows. The use of "small" underscores the insufficiency of human means to meet the needs of the crowd, pointing to the necessity of divine intervention.<p><b>and Jesus blessed them</b><br>The act of blessing the fish signifies Jesus' role as the provider and His authority over creation. In Jewish tradition, blessings were pronounced to acknowledge God's provision and to consecrate food. This blessing is reminiscent of the Jewish practice of giving thanks before meals, as seen in the traditional berakhah. Jesus' blessing here parallels His actions in the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>), reinforcing His identity as the Messiah who provides abundantly. This act also prefigures the Last Supper, where Jesus blesses the bread and wine, symbolizing His body and blood.<p><b>and ordered that these be set before them as well</b><br>Jesus' command to distribute the fish demonstrates His compassion and concern for the physical needs of the people. It also illustrates the orderly manner in which the miracle is performed, reflecting God's nature of bringing order out of chaos. The disciples' role in setting the food before the people highlights their participation in Jesus' ministry and foreshadows their future role in spreading the Gospel. This distribution mirrors the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), drawing a parallel between Jesus and Moses, and further establishing Jesus as the greater prophet and provider.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the multitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who are involved in distributing the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- A large group of people who have been following Jesus and are in need of food.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_small_fish.htm">The Small Fish</a></b><br>- Part of the provisions used by Jesus to feed the multitude, symbolizing God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>- The setting of this event, highlighting the desolate place where the miracle occurs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to multiply the small fish demonstrates God's power to provide abundantly from limited resources.
