This detail is significant in understanding the personal life of the apostles, showing that they had familial responsibilities. The mention of a mother-in-law also highlights the communal and family-oriented nature of Jewish society at the time. In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>, Paul refers to the right of the apostles to be accompanied by a believing wife, which further supports the idea that Peter was married.<p><b>was sick in bed with a fever</b><br>Fevers were often seen as serious ailments in ancient times, as medical knowledge was limited. The description of her being "sick in bed" suggests a condition that rendered her unable to perform her usual duties, which in a Jewish household would include hospitality and care for guests. This detail emphasizes the severity of her condition and sets the stage for the miraculous healing that follows. In the cultural context, illness was sometimes viewed as a result of sin or spiritual oppression, though not always.<p><b>and they promptly told Jesus about her</b><br>The disciples' immediate action in informing Jesus reflects their growing faith and recognition of His authority and power to heal. This act of bringing their concerns to Jesus is a model of prayer and intercession, showing trust in His compassion and ability to intervene. It also demonstrates the communal aspect of faith, where the needs of one are brought before Jesus by others. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where people bring the sick to Jesus, such as in <a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3-5</a>, where friends bring a paralytic to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon.htm">Simon (Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' first disciples, also known as Peter.

St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38</a>) uses a stronger expression, "was holden with a great fever" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>). There were marshes in that district; hence the prevalence of fevers of a malignant character. There is no mention of the wife of Peter by name in the New Testament. We may infer, from the fact that his wish's mother lived with him, that he was the head of the family. St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>) intimates that he was a married man, and that his wife accompanied him on his missionary tours. According to the testimony of Clement of Alexandria, and of Eusebius (3:30), she suffered martyrdom, and was led away to death in the sight of her husband, whose last words to her were, "Remember thou the Lord." St. Mark here tells us that Jesus came and took [Simon's wife's mother] by the hand, and raised her up. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-39.htm">Luke 4:39</a>) says that "he stood over her and rebuked the fever." <span class="cmt_word">Immediately the fever left her</span>. The word "immediately" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), familiar as it is to St. Mark, is here omitted by the best authorities. But the omission is of no importance; for the fact that "the fever left her," and that she was at once strong enough to "minister to them," proves that it was not like an ordinary recovery from fever, which is wont to be slow and tedious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;nos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
