They held significant power in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. Unlike the Pharisees, the Sadducees accepted only the written Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) as authoritative and rejected oral traditions. Their influence was primarily in the Temple and among the wealthy elite.<p><b>who say there is no resurrection</b><br>The Sadducees denied the resurrection of the dead, a belief that set them apart from the Pharisees, who affirmed it. This denial was rooted in their strict adherence to the Torah, where they found no explicit mention of resurrection. This theological stance is significant because it highlights their materialistic worldview and their focus on the present life rather than the afterlife. The belief in resurrection is a central theme in Christian doctrine, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, and is fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<p><b>came to Jesus</b><br>The Sadducees approached Jesus with the intent to challenge Him. This encounter took place in Jerusalem, likely in the Temple courts, during the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry. Their approach was not to seek truth but to trap Jesus in a theological debate, hoping to discredit Him in front of the people. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, as they perceived Him as a threat to their authority.<p><b>and questioned Him:</b><br>The Sadducees' questioning was a common rabbinic practice used to test one's knowledge and understanding of the law. However, their question was not sincere; it was designed to ridicule the concept of resurrection by presenting a hypothetical scenario. This method of questioning was typical of the Sadducees, who often engaged in debates to assert their doctrinal positions. Jesus' response to their question would not only address their misunderstanding but also affirm the truth of the resurrection, as seen in His subsequent teaching in <a href="/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect during the time of Jesus known for their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits.

The Hebrew word <span class="accented">Zadoc</span>, from which the Sadducees derive their name, means "just." or" righteous." These Sadducees accepted the Pentateuch, and probably more than the Pentateuch; but they rejected any oral tradition. They were known in the time of our Lord as denying those doctrines which connect us more immediately with another world, such as the existence of spirits and of angels, and the resurrection of the body. They altogether denied fate, affirming that all things are in our own power. They heard Christ preach the resurrection, and by means of it persuade men to repentance and a holy life. They therefore proposed to him a question which appeared to them to be fatal to the doctrine of a future state and a resurrection. The case supposed is that of seven brethren, who, in compliance with the Law of Moses, one after another, as each died in succession, took the same woman to wife. It is probable that such a case may actually have occurred; at any rate, it was a possible case. And the question founded upon it by the Sadducees was this - Whose wife would she be of them in the resurrection? Here, then, they hoped to entangle him, and to show that the doctrine of the resurrection was absurd. For if our Lord should say that in the resurrection she would be the wife of one only, the other brethren would have been excited to envy and continual strife. Nor could he have said that she would be common to the seven brothers. Such were the absurdities which, as they intimated, would flow out of his doctrine of the resurrection, if it could be proved. But our Lord scatters to the winds all this foolish reasoning, by adding one clause omitted by them, and overlooked by men of mere earthly minds, namely, that in the world to come this widow would be the wife of none of the seven brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[some] Sadducees,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#948;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#954;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Saddoukaioi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4523.htm">Strong's 4523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from Sadok; a Sadducaean, or follower of a certain heretical Israelite.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">say</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(legousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(einai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
