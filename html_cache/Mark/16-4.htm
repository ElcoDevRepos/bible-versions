The women who came to the tomb were likely focused on their task and the obstacles they anticipated, such as the stone blocking the entrance. Their looking up signifies a shift in focus from their immediate concerns to the unexpected reality before them. This moment of looking up can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual awakening or realization, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels.<p><b>they saw that the stone had been rolled away</b><br>The stone being rolled away is a significant detail, as it was a large stone meant to seal the tomb, preventing tampering or theft. This act is not just a physical reality but also a symbolic one, representing the removal of barriers between humanity and God through the resurrection of Jesus. The rolling away of the stone is a divine act, emphasizing that what is impossible for humans is possible with God. This event fulfills Jesus' prophecy about His resurrection and serves as a testament to His divine power.<p><b>even though it was extremely large</b><br>The mention of the stone's size underscores the miraculous nature of its removal. In the cultural and historical context, such stones were typically very heavy, requiring several men to move them. The fact that it was moved without human intervention highlights the supernatural aspect of the resurrection. This detail also serves to eliminate any doubt about the possibility of the disciples or others having moved the stone themselves, reinforcing the truth of the resurrection. The large stone can also be seen as a type of the law or sin, which Jesus has overcome, removing the barrier between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women (Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome)</a></b><br>These women were followers of Jesus who came to the tomb to anoint His body with spices after the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The burial place of Jesus, which was sealed with a large stone.
