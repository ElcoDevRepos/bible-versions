The man, now healed, desires to follow Jesus as a disciple. However, Jesus denies his request. This decision highlights Jesus' strategic approach to His ministry. By not allowing the man to accompany Him, Jesus emphasizes the importance of spreading the message of His works and mercy in the man's own community. This action also underscores the principle that discipleship can take many forms, not just physical following.<p><b>&#8220;Go home to your own people,&#8221; He said,</b><br>Jesus instructs the man to return to his own community, the Decapolis, a region of ten cities with a significant Gentile population. This directive is significant because it marks one of the first instances where Jesus explicitly sends someone to evangelize among the Gentiles. It reflects the broader mission of the Gospel, which is to reach all nations and peoples, not just the Jews. This command also aligns with the Great Commission found in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>&#8220;and tell them how much the Lord has done for you,</b><br>Here, Jesus emphasizes the importance of personal testimony. The man is to share his experience of deliverance and healing, which serves as a powerful witness to the transformative power of God. This phrase underscores the role of personal testimony in evangelism, as seen throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses. The phrase also highlights the recognition of Jesus' divine authority, as the works of Jesus are attributed to the Lord, indicating His unity with God.<p><b>and what mercy He has shown you.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of mercy is crucial, as it reflects the compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry. Mercy, a central theme in the Bible, is often associated with God's covenant love and kindness. In the Old Testament, God's mercy is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>. By instructing the man to speak of the mercy shown to him, Jesus is highlighting the grace and compassion inherent in His mission. This mercy is not just a personal experience but a testament to the character of God, inviting others to seek the same compassion and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who commands the healed man to return home and testify about God's mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>Previously possessed by a legion of demons, this man is now restored and desires to follow Jesus physically, but is instead commissioned to witness to his community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/decapolis.htm">Decapolis</a></b><br>The region where the healed man is sent to testify.

Jesus had just crossed the lake (<a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1</a>) and would soon leave again (v. 21); still, He assigns the man to stay.<p>&#8226; Jesus often redirects well-meaning desires to fit a larger plan (cf. <a href="/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience means trusting that Christ knows where our witness will bear the most fruit (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;no&#8221; is never rejection; it is redirection for Kingdom purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go home to your own people</b><p>Jesus pinpoints the man&#8217;s first mission field: the Decapolis towns that once feared him.
