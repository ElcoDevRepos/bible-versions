The colt, an unbroken young donkey, symbolizes peace and humility, contrasting with a war horse. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of the King coming to Jerusalem "righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey." The disciples' obedience in leading the colt to Jesus demonstrates their trust in His divine knowledge and authority.<p><b>and threw their cloaks over it</b><br>Throwing cloaks over the colt signifies respect and honor, creating a makeshift saddle for Jesus. This act mirrors the ancient custom of laying garments before a king, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a> when Jehu is proclaimed king. The cloaks symbolize submission and recognition of Jesus' kingship. This gesture by the disciples and the crowd acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, the anointed one, who is worthy of honor and reverence.<p><b>and He sat on it</b><br>Jesus sitting on the colt is a deliberate act to fulfill messianic prophecy and declare His identity as the Messiah. By choosing to ride a donkey, Jesus aligns Himself with the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, emphasizing His role as the Prince of Peace rather than a political or military leader. This action contrasts with the expectations of a conquering king and highlights the nature of His kingdom, which is spiritual and characterized by humility and peace.

By arranging these details, Jesus openly declares His identity as Israel&#8217;s promised King while still maintaining the humble posture foretold by the prophets (<a href="/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>threw their cloaks over it</b><p>&#8226; With no saddle available, the disciples use their garments as a makeshift seat&#8212;an everyday gesture that turns into a profound act of honor.

In effect they say, &#8220;Everything we have is Yours,&#8221; echoing <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>&#8217;s call to present our bodies &#8220;as a living sacrifice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The growing crowd soon follows suit, spreading cloaks and palm branches on the road (<a href="/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>; <a href="/luke/19-36.htm">Luke 19:36</a>). Their spontaneous generosity signals recognition&#8212;however fleeting&#8212;of Jesus&#8217; royal authority (<a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He sat on it</b><p>&#8226; Jesus mounts the colt and rides into Jerusalem, literally enacting <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, &#8220;See, your King comes to you&#8230; humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey&#8221;.<p>&#8226; A donkey, unlike a warhorse, symbolizes peace. By choosing it, Jesus offers Himself as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) rather than a military conqueror&#8212;contrasting His future return on a white horse in judgment (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This public ride compels the city to decide who He is. The Pharisees protest (<a href="/luke/19-39.htm">Luke 19:39</a>), but Jesus accepts the messianic acclaim, making clear that silence would cause &#8220;even the stones&#8221; to cry out (<a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal fulfillment of prophecy assures believers that every remaining promise&#8212;including His second coming&#8212;will be kept with equal precision (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-7.htm">Mark 11:7</a> captures obedient disciples, humble devotion, and the rightful King openly taking His place. The colt&#8217;s arrival shows Jesus&#8217; sovereign orchestration; the cloaks reveal surrendered hearts; His seating proclaims messianic peace and prophecy fulfilled. Together the verse invites us to obey promptly, lay our lives before Him willingly, and recognize Him joyfully as the promised, humble, yet sovereign King.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They led</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pherousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5342.htm">Strong's 5342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To carry, bear, bring; I conduct, lead; perhaps: I make publicly known.
