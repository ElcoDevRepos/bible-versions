In the context of Jewish legal proceedings, witnesses were crucial for establishing a case. The act of standing up signifies their readiness to present testimony, which was a formal part of the trial process. This setting is the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which met in Jerusalem. The trial took place at night, which was unusual and suggests a sense of urgency and irregularity in the proceedings.<p><b>and testified falsely against Him:</b><br>The false testimony against Jesus fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, where David speaks of false witnesses rising against him. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where the righteous suffer unjustly at the hands of deceitful accusers. The false testimony is a direct violation of the Ninth Commandment, which prohibits bearing false witness. This act of deceit highlights the moral and spiritual blindness of those who opposed Jesus. The false witnesses were likely motivated by the religious leaders' desire to eliminate Jesus, whom they saw as a threat to their authority. This moment foreshadows the ultimate injustice of Jesus' crucifixion, where the sinless one is condemned by sinful humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being falsely accused during His trial before the Sanhedrin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_witnesses.htm">False Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals who stood up to give false testimony against Jesus, contributing to the unjust trial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council and court that held the trial of Jesus, seeking to find grounds for His execution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, specifically in the vicinity of the high priest's residence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The Jewish religious leader presiding over the trial, seeking to condemn Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_of_bearing_false_witness.htm">The Sin of Bearing False Witness</a></b><br>Bearing false witness is a direct violation of God's commandments and leads to injustice and harm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_injustice_of_jesus'_trial.htm">The Injustice of Jesus' Trial</a></b><br>Jesus' trial was marked by falsehood and manipulation, reminding us of the world's opposition to truth and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/standing_firm_in_truth.htm">Standing Firm in Truth</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to stand firm in truth, even when faced with false accusations or persecution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>Despite the false testimony, God's sovereign plan was at work, leading to the fulfillment of prophecy and redemption through Jesus' sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_example_of_christ's_response.htm">The Example of Christ's Response</a></b><br>Jesus' calm and composed response to false accusations serves as a model for us in handling unjust situations with grace and trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_14_57_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 14:57?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_14_57_Danger_of_false_testimony.htm">How does Mark 14:57 illustrate the danger of false testimony against Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_linked_to_Mark_14_57.htm">What Old Testament prophecies connect to the false accusations in Mark 14:57?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_tell_truth_from_lies_daily.htm">How can we discern truth from falsehood in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_false_witness_like_Mark_14_57.htm">What steps can we take to avoid bearing false witness like in Mark 14:57?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Mark_14_57_Insights_on_Jesus_trial.htm">How does understanding Mark 14:57 deepen our appreciation for Jesus' trial and sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_14_57_False_testimony_on_Jesus.htm">What does Mark 14:57 reveal about false testimony against Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_14_57_Eyewitness_reliability.htm">How does Mark 14:57 challenge the reliability of eyewitness accounts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/False_witnesses_role_in_Jesus_trial.htm">Why were false witnesses significant in the trial of Jesus in Mark 14:57?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'overcome_by_the_blood'_mean.htm">What were the teachings of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_universal_church_of_god.htm">What is the timeline of Paul's life events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_gospel_resurrection_details_differ.htm">Why do the Gospel resurrection accounts contradict each other in details such as who arrived at the tomb?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_jesus_threatened_the_temple.htm">Mark 14:58 &#8211; Is there any historical or archaeological support for Jesus threatening to destroy the temple, or could this be a misinterpretation of his statement?

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>) says that they were two. What our Lord had really said was this - we read it in St. John (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>) - "Destroy this temple; and in three days I will raise it up." These words the false witnesses perverted; for they assigned to Jesus the work of destruction which he left to the Jews. He did not say," I will destroy;" but "Do ye destroy, and I will rebuild." Nor did he say, "I will build another;" but "I will raise it up," that is, from the dead; for St. John tells us that "he spake of the temple of his body," in which, as in a temple, there dwelt the fullness of the Godhead.. He might have said plainly, "I will rise from the dead;" but he chose to speak as in a parable. According to their witness, however, our Lord's words would appear as little more than an empty boast, certainly not as anything on account of which such a charge as they desired could be brought against him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">some [men]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
