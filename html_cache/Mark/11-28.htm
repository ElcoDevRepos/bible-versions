The context is Jesus' actions in the temple, particularly His cleansing of it, which challenged their authority and control. In Jewish culture, authority was highly respected and often linked to lineage, education, or divine appointment. The religious leaders were questioning Jesus' credentials and legitimacy, as He had not been formally trained in their rabbinical schools nor held an official position within the temple hierarchy. This question also reflects a broader theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' authority is frequently challenged by those in power. His authority is divine, as seen in His teachings, miracles, and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speak of the Messiah's divine authority.<p><b>they asked.</b><br>The religious leaders' inquiry is not a genuine search for truth but rather an attempt to trap Jesus. Throughout the Gospels, they often question Him with the intent to discredit or accuse Him. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious establishment, who felt threatened by His growing influence and the radical nature of His message. Their questioning is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>And who gave You the authority to do them?</b><br>This part of the question emphasizes the leaders' concern with the source of Jesus' authority. In Jewish tradition, authority was often passed down through recognized channels, such as the Sanhedrin or through prophetic anointing. By asking this, they are challenging Jesus to reveal His divine mandate, which He consistently attributes to His relationship with the Father (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>). This question also highlights the leaders' failure to recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, who would come with divine authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>.

Yet they refuse to submit, echoing earlier reactions when the crowds marveled that &#8220;He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents Jesus as acting with inherent, divine authority: He forgives sins (<a href="/mark/2-10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>), commands nature (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39-41</a>), and authoritatively interprets the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>). Each incident builds the case that His authority is not borrowed but intrinsic.<p>&#8226; Their challenge underscores the long-standing tension between human religious authority and God&#8217;s Messiah, foreshadowed in <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a> and fulfilled as Jesus &#8220;came to His own, but His own did not receive Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And who gave You the authority to do them?</b><p>&#8226; The leaders assume legitimate authority must be delegated by men like themselves&#8212;priests descended from Aaron or rabbis trained in recognized schools (compare <a href="/acts/4-5.htm">Acts 4:5-7</a>). They demand Jesus name His sponsor.<p>&#8226; Jesus later answers indirectly: &#8220;Was John&#8217;s baptism from heaven or from men?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/11-30.htm">Mark 11:30</a>). By linking His ministry to John&#8217;s, He exposes their refusal to acknowledge any authority that originates &#8220;from heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Father Himself is the giver: &#8220;The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>), and after the resurrection Jesus will state plainly, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their question reveals spiritual blindness. The very signs foretold in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> and performed before their eyes testify that God has authenticated Jesus. Yet they persist in unbelief, illustrating <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>, where a veil remains over hardened hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-28.htm">Mark 11:28</a> captures a showdown between Israel&#8217;s religious establishment and the Son of God. The leaders acknowledge the reality of Jesus&#8217; works yet refuse the divine source behind them. Their twofold demand about authority exposes their unbelief and sets the stage for Jesus to reveal that His commission comes directly from the Father. The verse invites readers to recognize that Christ&#8217;s authority is inherent, heaven-sent, and absolute&#8212;an authority believers gladly submit to while opponents continue to resist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;By</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
