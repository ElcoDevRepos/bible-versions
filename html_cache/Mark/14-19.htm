This moment occurs during the Last Supper, a significant event in the Passion narrative. The setting is Jerusalem, during the Passover, a time of remembrance for the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. The disciples' grief is compounded by the realization that one among them would betray their beloved teacher, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. This grief also foreshadows the sorrow that will envelop them during Jesus' crucifixion.<p><b>and to ask Him one after another</b><br>The phrase indicates a sense of urgency and personal introspection among the disciples. Each disciple questions Jesus individually, highlighting their concern and fear of being the betrayer. This moment underscores the close-knit nature of the group and their inability to comprehend that one of their own could commit such an act. The repetitive questioning also reflects the communal aspect of their relationship with Jesus, as they seek reassurance from Him directly. This scene parallels the communal questioning seen in other biblical narratives, such as the Israelites questioning Moses in the wilderness.<p><b>&#8220;Surely not I?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals the disciples' self-doubt and the gravity of Jesus' announcement. The phrase "Surely not I?" is a rhetorical question, expressing disbelief and a plea for affirmation. It demonstrates the disciples' awareness of human frailty and sinfulness, echoing the biblical theme of self-examination found in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>. The question also highlights the tension between divine foreknowledge and human free will, as each disciple grapples with the possibility of being the betrayer. This moment serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and faithfulness in the Christian life, as even those closest to Jesus are susceptible to failure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, who is sharing the Last Supper with His disciples and has just revealed that one of them will betray Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve followers of Jesus who are present at the Last Supper.

This grief was real, immediate, and shared.<p>&#8226; Such &#8220;godly sorrow&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>) shows the conscience operating the way God designed, alerting each disciple to the seriousness of sin.<p>&#8226; The prophecy of <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;Even my close friend&#8230;has lifted his heel against me&#8221;&#8212;was unfolding before their eyes, and they felt its weight.<p>&#8226; Luke records the same reaction: &#8220;They began to question among themselves which of them might do this&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-23.htm">Luke 22:23</a>), emphasizing that the grief was deeply personal for every man at the table.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to ask Him</b><p>&#8226; Instead of whispering among themselves, the disciples turned to Jesus for clarity. John notes that Peter &#8220;motioned to [John] to ask Jesus which one He was talking about&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-24.htm">John 13:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Going directly to the Lord mirrors the Psalmist&#8217;s habit: &#8220;Search me, O God, and know my heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>). When conviction rises, the proper response is to bring every doubt and fear to Christ.<p>&#8226; This posture also fulfills <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>&#8212;&#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God&#8221;. In the presence of confusion or potential failure, the safest place is at the Savior&#8217;s feet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one after another</b><p>&#8226; The phrase paints a vivid picture: each disciple, in turn, voices his concern. No one assumes immunity; each takes personal responsibility.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a> reminds us, &#8220;So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God&#8221;. The scene models that truth&#8212;accountability before the Lord is individual.<p>&#8226; Their orderly, sincere inquiries contrast sharply with later disorder in Gethsemane, highlighting that intimacy with Christ encourages thoughtful self-examination.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Surely not I?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The words reveal humility mixed with apprehension. While none could fathom betraying Jesus, none presumed absolute faithfulness, echoing <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;Blessed is the one who always fears the Lord, but whoever hardens his heart falls into trouble&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Paul warns, &#8220;If you think you are standing firm, be careful not to fall&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>). The disciples&#8217; question shows a healthy distrust of the flesh.<p>&#8226; Yet the phrase also carries a plea for reassurance. Like the tax collector who cried, &#8220;God, be merciful to me, a sinner&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>), they sought the Lord&#8217;s confirming word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/14-19.htm">Mark 14:19</a> captures a solemn, honest moment around the Passover table. Confronted with Jesus&#8217; prophecy of betrayal, each disciple experiences heartfelt grief, turns to the Lord for answers, personally owns the possibility of failure, and humbly seeks reassurance. The verse invites every believer to maintain tender consciences, bring doubts to Christ, accept individual accountability, and cling to the Savior for the grace that keeps us faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?</span> The disciples were naturally disposed to be joyful at this great festival.
