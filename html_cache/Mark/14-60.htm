The role of the high priest was central in Jewish worship and governance, especially during the Passover. Caiaphas's standing up indicates a moment of heightened tension and authority. This scene takes place in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which was the highest court of justice and the supreme council in ancient Jerusalem. The high priest's actions reflect the gravity of the situation, as Jesus was being tried for blasphemy, a charge that could lead to death.<p><b>and questioned Jesus,</b><br>The questioning of Jesus by the high priest was a formal part of the trial process. In Jewish legal proceedings, the accused was expected to respond to charges brought against them. This moment is significant as it fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant who would be oppressed and afflicted, yet not open his mouth (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The questioning also highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who felt threatened by His teachings and growing influence.<p><b>&#8220;Have You no answer?</b><br>This question underscores the expectation for Jesus to defend Himself against the accusations. In the cultural context, silence could be interpreted as an admission of guilt. However, Jesus's silence fulfills the messianic prophecy and demonstrates His submission to God's will. His refusal to answer can be seen as a powerful statement of His innocence and His role as the sacrificial Lamb, who willingly goes to the slaughter without protest.<p><b>What are these men testifying against You?&#8221;</b><br>The testimony against Jesus was based on false accusations and misinterpretations of His teachings. The Gospels record that the witnesses could not agree on their testimonies, which was a requirement for a valid conviction under Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This highlights the injustice of the trial and the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The false testimony also serves to contrast the truth of Jesus's identity and mission with the lies of His accusers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest at this time was Caiaphas, who played a significant role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.

Caiaphas directs the focus toward Jesus, attempting to force a self-incriminating statement, paralleling the earlier private inquiries in <a href="/john/18-19.htm">John 18:19</a>. Mark notes that &#8220;many testified falsely against Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56</a>), showing the trial&#8217;s unjust nature, foreseen in <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>: &#8220;Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me things I do not know.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have You no answer?</b><p>Jesus&#8217; silence is purposeful, displaying meekness without guilt. <a href="/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62-63</a> records the same silence, and Peter later interprets it as the model for suffering believers: &#8220;When He suffered, He made no threats&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).

But he held his peace, and answered nothing</span>. The high priest would naturally be seated at the top of the semicircle, with the members of the Sanhedrim on either side of him, and the Accused in front of him. Now he rises from his seat, and comes forward into the midst (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and demands an answer. But Jesus answered nothing. It would have been a long and tedious business to answer such a charge, which involved a garbled and inaccurate statement of what he had said. It would have answered no good purpose to reply to an accusation so vague and inaccurate. Our Lord knew that, whatever his answer was, it would be twisted so as to make against him. Silence was therefore the most dignified treatment of such an accusation. Besides, he knew that his hour was come. The high priest now asks him plainly, <span class="cmt_word">Art</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou the Christ, the son of the Blessed?</span> Here he touches the point of the whole matter. Christ had frequently declared himself to be such. Caiaphas, therefore, now asks the question, not because he needed the information, but that he might condemn him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-60.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
