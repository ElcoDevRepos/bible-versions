This phrase highlights their communal approach to problem-solving and decision-making. In the context of first-century Jewish culture, communal discussion was a common method for interpreting the Torah and understanding daily life challenges. This setting also emphasizes the disciples' close relationship and their shared experiences as followers of Jesus.<p><b>the fact that they had no bread.</b><br>Bread was a staple in the diet of the people in ancient Israel, symbolizing sustenance and life. The lack of bread here is significant, as it follows the miraculous feeding of the 4,000, where Jesus demonstrated His power to provide. This situation reveals the disciples' struggle to fully grasp Jesus' divine nature and His ability to meet their needs. It also serves as a reminder of the Israelites' reliance on God for manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), drawing a parallel between Jesus and God's provision. The disciples' concern over physical bread contrasts with Jesus' teachings about spiritual nourishment, as seen in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the "bread of life."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is teaching His disciples about faith and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- The followers of Jesus who are often depicted as struggling to understand His teachings and miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread.htm">Bread</a></b><br>- A recurring symbol in the Gospels, representing both physical sustenance and spiritual nourishment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/boat.htm">Boat</a></b><br>- The setting for this passage, often used in the Gospels as a place of teaching and revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_herod.htm">Pharisees and Herod</a></b><br>- Mentioned earlier in the chapter as those who demand a sign from Jesus, representing unbelief and spiritual blindness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_blindness.htm">Understanding Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>The disciples' focus on physical bread reveals their spiritual blindness.

Physical shortage becomes an object lesson: without Him, nothing satisfies; with Him, there is always enough (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; focus on &#8220;no bread&#8221; contrasts with Jesus&#8217; focus on corrupt teaching (&#8220;leaven&#8221;). Earthly needs can blind us to spiritual dangers (<a href="/matthew/16-11.htm">Matthew 16:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ will patiently question them until they see that provision is guaranteed when He is present (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/8-16.htm">Mark 8:16</a> shows the disciples slipping into anxious, self-centered dialogue right after a direct word from Jesus. Their preoccupation with missing bread reveals how quickly tangible concerns can overshadow recent miracles and current fellowship with the Lord. The verse invites believers to shift from counting loaves to trusting the Living Bread, remembering past deliverance, and bringing every lack to Christ instead of merely talking among ourselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - According to the most approved readings, this verse should be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread</span>. There is something very artless and simple in this narrative. Our Lord speaks of" leaven;" and the mention of this word reminds the disciples that they had forgotten to bring bread with them in the boat; and fearing lest Christ should direct them, according to his wont, to land on some desert shore, they were in some anxiety how they might obtain what they would need; and so they disputed among themselves; one, it may be, throwing the blame upon another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they began to discuss</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(dielogizonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1260.htm">Strong's 1260: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reason (with), debate (with), consider.
