The name "Gethsemane" means "oil press," indicating it was likely an olive grove with a press for extracting oil. This setting is significant as olive oil was used for anointing, symbolizing the Holy Spirit and consecration. The garden's location on the Mount of Olives is also prophetic, as <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> mentions the Lord standing on the Mount of Olives in the end times. Gethsemane is a place of deep spiritual significance, where Jesus often went to pray (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>).<p><b>and Jesus told His disciples</b><br>Jesus' instruction to His disciples highlights His role as a teacher and leader. Throughout His ministry, Jesus prepared His disciples for the challenges they would face after His departure. This moment in Gethsemane is a pivotal point where Jesus begins to face His impending suffering, and He seeks the support of His closest followers. The disciples' presence underscores the communal aspect of faith and the importance of fellowship in times of trial.<p><b>&#8220;Sit here while I pray.&#8221;</b><br>Prayer is a central theme in Jesus' life and ministry. In this moment, Jesus models the importance of seeking God's presence and strength in times of distress. His instruction for the disciples to "sit here" suggests a need for them to remain vigilant and supportive, even as He steps away to pray alone. This act of prayer in Gethsemane is a fulfillment of His role as the intercessor, foreshadowing His ultimate sacrifice. It also connects to <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, which speaks of Jesus offering prayers with fervent cries and tears.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing for His impending crucifixion.

Josephus tells us that these gardens were numerous in the suburbs of Jerusalem. St. Jerome says that "Gethsemane was at the foot of the Mount of Olives."

The word "Gethsemane" means literally "the place of the <span class="accented">olive-press</span>," whither the olives which abounded on the slopes of the mountain were brought, in order that the oil contained in them might be pressed out. The exact position of Gethsemane is not known; although there is an enclosed spot at the foot of the western slope of the Mount of Olives which is called to this day <span class="accented">El maniye.</span> The real Gethsemane cannot be far from this spot. Our Lord resorted to this place for retirement and prayer, not as desiring to escape the death that awaited him.
