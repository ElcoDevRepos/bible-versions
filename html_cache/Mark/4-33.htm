Jesus often employed parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. This method allowed Him to communicate profound truths in a way that was accessible to those with open hearts while concealing them from those who were spiritually blind. The use of parables also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of opening the mouth in parables.<p><b>Jesus spoke the word to them</b><br>Jesus, as the living Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>), communicated divine truths directly to the people. His teachings were authoritative and transformative, reflecting His unique role as the Messiah. The phrase "spoke the word" emphasizes the power and importance of His message, which was not merely human wisdom but divine revelation. This aligns with the Old Testament prophets who also delivered God's word to the people.<p><b>to the extent that they could understand</b><br>This phrase highlights the compassionate and considerate nature of Jesus' teaching. He tailored His message to the spiritual maturity and readiness of His audience. In <a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11-13</a>, Jesus explains that understanding is granted to those who are willing to receive it. This selective revelation underscores the principle that spiritual insight is a gift from God, given to those who seek it earnestly. It also reflects the idea that spiritual growth is a process, and Jesus met His listeners where they were in their journey of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowds using parables.
