The context of this passage is a question posed by the Sadducees, a Jewish sect that denied the resurrection. They are attempting to challenge Jesus with a hypothetical situation based on the law of levirate marriage, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>. This law required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow if the brother died without leaving an heir, ensuring the family line and property remained intact. The Sadducees' use of seven brothers emphasizes the extremity of their hypothetical situation, aiming to ridicule the concept of resurrection.<p><b>The first one married and died,</b><br>The mention of marriage here is crucial as it sets the stage for the levirate marriage law to be invoked. In ancient Jewish society, marriage was not only a personal union but also a social and economic contract that ensured the continuation of a family line. The death of the first brother without offspring is significant because it triggers the levirate obligation. This scenario reflects the vulnerability of women in that era, who relied on male relatives for social and economic security. The death of the first brother without children introduces the problem the Sadducees are using to question the resurrection.<p><b>Leaving no children.</b><br>The absence of children is a critical element in this narrative, as it is the condition that necessitates the levirate marriage. In biblical times, having children was seen as a blessing and a means of preserving one's legacy and name. The lack of offspring not only posed a personal tragedy but also a communal concern, as it threatened the continuity of the family line. This detail underscores the importance of the levirate law and sets the stage for the Sadducees' challenge to Jesus regarding the resurrection. Theologically, this phrase also highlights the human concern for legacy and continuity, which contrasts with the eternal perspective Jesus offers in His teachings on the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_brothers.htm">Seven Brothers</a></b><br>This refers to a hypothetical scenario presented by the Sadducees to Jesus.

Yet every detail&#8212;multiple brothers, marriage, death, and childlessness&#8212;underscores God&#8217;s sovereign design to preserve His people and point to a life beyond the grave.
