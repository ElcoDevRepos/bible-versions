Previously, He was in Galilee, engaging with the Pharisees and teaching the crowds. His departure signifies a shift in focus, possibly seeking rest or a change in audience. This movement is consistent with His itinerant ministry, where He traveled to various regions to preach and perform miracles.<p><b>and went to the region of Tyre.</b><br>Tyre was a significant Phoenician city located northwest of Galilee, known for its wealth and trade. It was predominantly Gentile, highlighting Jesus' outreach beyond Jewish territories. This journey to a Gentile region foreshadows the later mission to the Gentiles, as seen in Acts. The inclusion of Tyre emphasizes the universal scope of Jesus' ministry, breaking traditional Jewish boundaries.<p><b>Not wanting anyone to know He was there,</b><br>This suggests Jesus sought privacy, possibly for rest or to teach His disciples without interruption. It reflects His humanity, needing solitude amidst His demanding ministry. This desire for secrecy is seen elsewhere, such as in <a href="/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a>, where Jesus often instructed those He healed to remain silent about His identity, emphasizing His control over His public revelation.<p><b>He entered a house,</b><br>Entering a house indicates a private setting, contrasting with His public ministry. Houses in this context were often small and intimate, allowing for personal interaction. This setting is significant for the following narrative, where Jesus engages with the Syrophoenician woman, demonstrating His willingness to interact personally and compassionately with individuals.<p><b>but was unable to escape their notice.</b><br>Despite His efforts for privacy, Jesus' presence could not be hidden. This highlights His growing fame and the desperation of people seeking His help. It underscores the magnetic nature of His ministry and the deep needs of those around Him. This inability to remain unnoticed is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/mark/3-7.htm">Mark 3:7-8</a>, where crowds from various regions sought Him out, illustrating the widespread impact of His work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is traveling and teaching.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A region outside of Jewish territory, known for its Gentile population and historical significance as a major Phoenician city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>A specific location where Jesus sought privacy, indicating His need for rest and retreat from the crowds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_intentional_retreat.htm">Jesus' Intentional Retreat</a></b><br>Jesus sought solitude, demonstrating the importance of rest and reflection in ministry.

There is not sufficient authority for omitting "Sidon" from the text. Both these cities were renowned for their extensive commerce and for their wealth. It is probable that the true reading in Ver. 31, which will be noticed presently, may have led to the omission by some authorities of "Sidon" here. But there is really no inconsistency in retaining the words "and Sidon" here; and accepting the reading" through Sidon" there. Tyro, which was the capital of Phoenicia, lay to the south, bordering on Judaea; Sidon to the north: and multitudes flocked to Christ from these parts. <span class="cmt_word">He entered into a house, and would have no man know it: and he could not be hid.</span> He would have no man know it, partly for the sake of quiet, and partly lest he should rouse the Jews more bitterly against him, and give them occasion to cavil that he was not the Messiah promised to the Jews, because, having left them, he had turned to the Gentiles.
