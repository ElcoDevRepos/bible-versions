The chief priests were responsible for temple rituals and maintaining religious order, while the scribes were experts in the Law of Moses. This phrase indicates their awareness of Jesus' actions and teachings, particularly His cleansing of the temple, which challenged their authority and practices. The religious leaders were often in opposition to Jesus, as seen in other passages like <a href="/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15</a> and <a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>.<p><b>they looked for a way to kill Him</b><br>This reflects the growing hostility and plotting against Jesus by the religious leaders. Their desire to kill Him was rooted in their perception of Him as a threat to their power and influence. This animosity fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would be "despised and rejected by men." The leaders' plotting is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>, where they conspired to put Jesus to death.<p><b>For they were afraid of Him</b><br>The fear of Jesus among the religious leaders was due to His growing influence and the authority with which He taught. His ability to perform miracles and His deep understanding of the Scriptures challenged their authority and exposed their hypocrisy. This fear is similar to the fear Herod had of John the Baptist in <a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>, where fear is linked to the recognition of righteousness and truth.<p><b>because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching</b><br>The crowd's astonishment highlights Jesus' unique authority and wisdom, which was unlike the teaching of the scribes (<a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>). His teachings often included parables and direct challenges to the established religious norms, resonating with the common people. This astonishment is a recurring reaction to Jesus' ministry, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds were amazed at His teaching because He taught as one with authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who held significant authority and influence. They were responsible for maintaining the religious order and were often resistant to Jesus' teachings, which challenged their authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, whose teachings and actions often confronted the established religious norms. In this passage, His actions in the temple and His teachings caused fear among the religious leaders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The general populace who were present in the temple. They were "astonished" at Jesus' teachings, indicating a sense of wonder and perhaps a recognition of the truth in His words.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jewish people in Jerusalem. It was a place of significant religious activity and authority, and Jesus' actions there were highly symbolic.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_plotting.htm">Fear and Plotting</a></b><br>The reaction of the religious leaders to Jesus' influence. Their fear led them to conspire against Him, highlighting the tension between Jesus and the established religious order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_losing_control.htm">Fear of Losing Control</a></b><br>The religious leaders' fear of Jesus' influence highlights the human tendency to resist change and protect established power structures. We must examine our own lives for areas where fear of losing control may hinder our acceptance of God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/astonishment_at_truth.htm">Astonishment at Truth</a></b><br>The crowd's astonishment at Jesus' teaching reminds us of the power of God's Word to challenge and transform. We should approach Scripture with an open heart, ready to be amazed and changed by its truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/opposition_to_righteousness.htm">Opposition to Righteousness</a></b><br>Jesus' experience with the religious leaders teaches us that standing for truth and righteousness may lead to opposition. We should be prepared to face resistance when we align ourselves with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_temple.htm">The Role of the Temple</a></b><br>Jesus' actions in the temple underscore the importance of purity and reverence in worship. We should strive to maintain the sanctity of our worship spaces and practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>The plotting against Jesus foreshadows the cost of true discipleship.
