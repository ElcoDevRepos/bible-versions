The anger of Jesus is not sinful but reflects His divine justice and holiness. This moment is reminiscent of the Old Testament prophets who expressed God's anger towards Israel's disobedience (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). Jesus' anger is directed at the hardness of heart, not at the individuals themselves, showing His desire for repentance and change.<p><b>and sorrow at their hardness of heart.</b><br>Jesus' sorrow indicates His deep compassion and love for humanity, even when they are in rebellion against God. The hardness of heart refers to the spiritual blindness and stubbornness of the Pharisees, who refused to see the truth of Jesus' mission. This echoes the lament of God over Israel's repeated disobedience (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>). The dual emotions of anger and sorrow demonstrate the balance of justice and mercy in Jesus' character.<p><b>Then He said to the man, &#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command to the man with the withered hand is a call to faith and obedience. Despite the potential consequences of breaking Sabbath traditions, Jesus prioritizes the man's healing and restoration. This act challenges the prevailing interpretations of the Law, emphasizing the spirit rather than the letter. The command also parallels other instances where Jesus calls individuals to act in faith (e.g., <a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8</a>).<p><b>So he stretched it out,</b><br>The man's response to Jesus' command is an act of faith. By stretching out his hand, he demonstrates trust in Jesus' authority and power to heal. This act of obedience is crucial, as it aligns with the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The man's willingness to act despite his disability reflects the transformative power of faith in Christ.<p><b>and it was restored.</b><br>The restoration of the man's hand is a testament to Jesus' divine power and authority over physical ailments. This miracle serves as a sign of the coming Kingdom of God, where restoration and healing are central themes (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate restoration that Jesus will bring through His death and resurrection, offering spiritual healing and redemption to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the synagogue, demonstrating His authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>- Religious leaders who are observing Jesus, often with the intent to accuse Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_withered_hand.htm">The Man with the Withered Hand</a></b><br>- A man present in the synagogue with a physical ailment, whom Jesus heals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>- The place of worship and teaching where this event occurs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- Other individuals present in the synagogue, witnessing the interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger.htm">Righteous Anger</a></b><br>Jesus' anger is directed at the hardness of heart, not at the individuals themselves.

In one decisive moment He confronts unbelief, commands an impossible act, ignites faith, and restores what was broken&#8212;demonstrating that He is both Judge and Healer, calling each observer (then and now) to exchange hardness for trusting obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had looked round about on them with anger, being</span> <span class="cmt_word">grieved</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) - the word has a touch of "condolence" in it - at the hardening of their heart. All this is very characteristic of St. Mark, who is careful to notice the visible expression of our Lord's feelings in his looks. The account is evidently from an eye-witness, or from one who had it from an eye-witness. <span class="accented">He looked round about on them with anger.</span> He was indignant at their blindness of heart, and their unbelief, which led them to attack the miracles of mercy wrought by him on the sabbath day as though they were a violation of the law of the sabbath. We see here how plainly there were in Christ the passions and affections common to the human nature, only restrained and subordinated to reason. Hero is the difference between the anger of fallen man and the anger of the sinless One. With fallen man, auger is the desire of retaliating, of punishing those by whom you consider yourself unjustly treated. Hence, in other men, anger springs from self-love; in Christ it sprang from the love of God. He loved God above all things; hence he was distressed and irritated on account of the wrongs done to God by sins and sinners. So that his anger was a righteous zeal for the honour of God; and hence it was mingled with grief, because, in their blindness and obstinacy, they would not acknowledge him to be the Messiah, but misrepresented his kindnesses wrought on the sick on the sabbath day, and found fault with them as evil. Thus our Lord, by showing grief and sorrow, makes it plain that his anger did not spring from the desire of revenge. He was indeed angry at the sin, while he grieved over and with the sinners, as those whom he loved, and for whose sake he came into the world that he might redeem and save them. <span class="cmt_word">Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored</span>. The words "whole as the other" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5e5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e5;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dd;&#x5d4;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5e5;&#x5bb;</span>) are not found in the best uncials. They were probably inserted from St. Matthew. In this instance our Lord performed no outward act. "He spake, and it was done." The Divine power wrought the miracle concurrently with the act of faith on the part of the man in obeying the command. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] looked around at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#949;&#968;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(periblepsamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4017.htm">Strong's 4017: </a> </span><span class="str2">To look around on, survey.
