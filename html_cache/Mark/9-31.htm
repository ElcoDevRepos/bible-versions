This teaching moment is part of a series of predictions about His death and resurrection, emphasizing the importance of understanding His purpose. The disciples were often confused or resistant to these teachings, reflecting their expectations of a political Messiah rather than a suffering servant.<p><b>He told them,</b><br>Jesus directly communicated with His disciples, ensuring they received firsthand knowledge of His mission. This personal instruction highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers. It also underscores the importance of direct revelation in understanding divine truths, as opposed to relying solely on public teachings or parables.<p><b>&#8220;The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men.</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a figure with authority and glory. Jesus uses it to refer to Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His divine mission. The phrase "delivered into the hands of men" indicates betrayal and divine sovereignty, as it fulfills prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-7</a>, where the suffering servant is despised and rejected.<p><b>They will kill Him,</b><br>This prediction of Jesus' death is central to the Gospel message. It aligns with Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretell the suffering and death of the Messiah. The statement also foreshadows the events of the Passion, where Jesus is crucified, fulfilling the sacrificial system of the Old Covenant as the ultimate Passover Lamb.<p><b>and after three days He will rise.&#8221;</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. The "three days" motif is significant, echoing Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and symbolizing completeness and divine intervention.

Our Lord repeats this prediction, in order that, when these events actually took place, his disciples might not be alarmed or offended, or abandon their faith in him, as though he could not be the Messiah because he underwent so terrible a death. It will be remembered that, notwithstanding these repeated warnings from their Lord, when these events actually took place, "they all forsook him and fled." It was therefore necessary that this coming event of his crucifixion should be repeatedly impressed upon them, that they might thus be assured that he was willing to undergo this bitter death; that he was not going to his cross by constraint, but as a willing Sacrifice, that he might do the will of his Father, and so redeem mankind. Therefore he repeated all this in Galilee, when he returned from his transfiguration, and after he had cast out the evil spirit from the epileptic child, and so had gained to himself great renown. He would thus restrain the excited feelings of his disciples, and impress upon them the reasons for his journey to Jerusalem, and prepare them for the dread realities which were awaiting him there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
