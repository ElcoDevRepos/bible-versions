In the biblical context, "tribulation" often signifies a time of testing or judgment. Historically, this can be linked to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, a catastrophic event for the Jewish people. Theologically, it is also seen as a foreshadowing of the end times, a period of great turmoil before the return of Christ. This aligns with the apocalyptic literature found in Daniel and Revelation, where tribulation precedes divine intervention.<p><b>unseen from the beginning of God&#8217;s creation</b><br>This emphasizes the unprecedented nature of the tribulation. It suggests a level of suffering and chaos that surpasses any previous event in history. The reference to "God's creation" underscores the divine order established from the beginning, as seen in Genesis. This phrase highlights the severity of the tribulation, suggesting it is a pivotal moment in God's redemptive plan, echoing the catastrophic events described in the flood narrative of Genesis.<p><b>until now</b><br>This indicates that the tribulation is unparalleled up to the present moment in history. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing nature of human suffering and the anticipation of future fulfillment of prophecy. The phrase connects the past with the present, suggesting continuity in God's sovereign plan. It also reflects the historical context of the early Christian community, which faced persecution and hardship, reinforcing their hope in Christ's ultimate victory.<p><b>and never to be seen again</b><br>This assures that the tribulation is a unique event, never to be repeated. It provides hope and comfort, indicating a definitive end to suffering and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This echoes the prophetic visions in Isaiah and Revelation, where a new heaven and earth are promised. The finality of this statement underscores the ultimate triumph of God's purposes and the restoration of creation, aligning with the eschatological hope found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is addressing His disciples about future events, warning them of the coming tribulation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' discourse, representing all believers who are to heed His warnings and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribulation.htm">Tribulation</a></b><br>A period of intense suffering and distress, described as unparalleled in history, which is a central theme in eschatological teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>Refers to the entirety of God's creation, emphasizing the magnitude of the tribulation in comparison to all of history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/end_times.htm">End Times</a></b><br>The broader context of this passage, dealing with eschatological events leading up to the return of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_tribulation.htm">Understanding Tribulation</a></b><br>Recognize that tribulation is a part of God's sovereign plan, and it serves to purify and strengthen the faith of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context.htm">Historical Context</a></b><br>Appreciate the historical and prophetic context of Jesus' words, understanding that they were meant to prepare His followers for future challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_perseverance.htm">Faith and Perseverance</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of maintaining faith and perseverance during times of trial, trusting in God's ultimate deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eschatological_awareness.htm">Eschatological Awareness</a></b><br>Encourage believers to be aware of eschatological teachings, fostering a readiness for Christ's return and a commitment to living righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ.htm">Hope in Christ</a></b><br>Despite the severity of the tribulation, believers can find hope in the promise of Christ's return and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_13_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 13:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_tribulation_days.htm">How can we prepare for "those days" of tribulation mentioned in Mark 13:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_tribulation_teach_on_sovereignty.htm">What does "such tribulation as has not occurred" teach about God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_13_19_link_to_Daniel_Revelation.htm">How does Mark 13:19 relate to prophecies in Daniel and Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_trials_in_Mark_13_19.htm">How should believers respond to trials, knowing God's control over history in Mark 13:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_strengthen_faith_in_trials_3.htm">What practical steps can we take to strengthen our faith during tribulation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_13_19_God_s_role_in_suffering.htm">What does Mark 13:19 reveal about God's role in human suffering and tribulation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_13_19_Loving_just_God.htm">How does Mark 13:19 align with the concept of a loving and just God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Which_events_does_Mark_13_19_reference.htm">What historical events might Mark 13:19 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_end_times.htm">What does the Bible say about the end times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'first_will_be_last'_mean.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'first will be last'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_death_for_sabbath-breaking,_not_mercy.htm">Exodus 31:15 -

To begin with, the tribulation would be so unexampled and so severe that the days themselves would be called "tribulation." They would be known ever after as "the tribulation.'" There never had been anything like them, and there never would be again. Neither the Deluge, nor the destruction of the cities of the plain, nor the drowning of Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, nor the slaughter of the Canaanites, nor the destruction of Nineveh, or of Babylon, or of other great cities and nations, would be so violent and dreadful as the overthrow of Jerusalem by Titus. All this is confirmed by Josephus, who says, speaking of this overthrow, "I do not think that any state ever suffered such things, or any nation within the memory of man." St. Chrysostom assigns the cause of all this to the base and cruel treatment of the Son of God by the Jews. The destruction of their city and their temple, and their continued desolation afterwards, were the lessons by which the Jews were to be taught that the Christ had indeed come, and that this was the Christ whom they had crucified and slain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
