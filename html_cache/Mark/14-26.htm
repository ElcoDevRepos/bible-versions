The hymn likely refers to the Hallel Psalms (Psalms 113-118), traditionally sung during Passover. These psalms praise God for His deliverance and faithfulness, themes that resonate with the impending sacrifice of Jesus. Singing hymns was a customary part of Jewish worship, reflecting a deep-rooted tradition of using music to express faith and gratitude.<p><b>they went out</b><br>This indicates a transition from the intimate setting of the Last Supper to a more public space. The act of going out signifies a movement towards the fulfillment of Jesus' mission. It also marks the beginning of the events leading to His arrest and crucifixion. The disciples' willingness to follow Jesus at this moment demonstrates their commitment, despite their lack of understanding of the events to come.<p><b>to the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives is a significant location in biblical history and prophecy. Situated east of Jerusalem, it offers a panoramic view of the city. It is a place where Jesus often went to pray and teach (<a href="/luke/21-37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>). The Mount of Olives is also associated with messianic prophecy, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, which speaks of the Lord standing on the mount in the day of the Lord. This location sets the stage for Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane and His subsequent arrest, highlighting the fulfillment of His role as the suffering servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, preparing for His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus, present with Him during the Last Supper and the subsequent events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hymn.htm">The Hymn</a></b><br>Likely a traditional Passover hymn, possibly from the Hallel (Psalms 113-118), sung after the Passover meal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mount_of_olives.htm">The Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A significant location east of Jerusalem, often a place of teaching and prayer for Jesus, and the setting for His arrest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The final meal Jesus shares with His disciples, during which He institutes the Lord's Supper.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_worship_in_times_of_trial.htm">The Importance of Worship in Times of Trial</a></b><br>Even as Jesus faced imminent suffering, He engaged in worship, demonstrating the power and necessity of praise in difficult times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_tradition_in_faith.htm">The Role of Tradition in Faith</a></b><br>The singing of a hymn reflects the continuity of Jewish tradition and its fulfillment in Christ, encouraging believers to appreciate and understand the roots of their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_spiritual_battles.htm">Preparation for Spiritual Battles</a></b><br>Jesus' movement to the Mount of Olives signifies preparation for the spiritual battle ahead, reminding believers to seek solitude and prayer in their own times of trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_in_crisis.htm">Community in Crisis</a></b><br>Jesus did not face His final hours alone but with His disciples, highlighting the importance of community and support in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>The events at the Mount of Olives fulfill Old Testament prophecies, reinforcing the reliability of Scripture and God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_14_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 14:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Inspiration_from_Mark_14_26_for_daily_worship.htm">How does Mark 14:26 inspire us to incorporate worship into daily life?
