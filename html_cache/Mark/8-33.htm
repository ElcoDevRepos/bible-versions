By turning and looking at them, Jesus ensures that His response is a teaching moment for all. This action underscores the communal nature of discipleship and the importance of correct understanding among His followers. It also reflects the rabbinic tradition of using moments of correction as opportunities for broader instruction.<p><b>rebuked Peter and said</b><br>The act of rebuking is significant in biblical terms, often used to correct or admonish. Jesus' rebuke of Peter is a strong corrective measure, emphasizing the seriousness of Peter's misunderstanding. In the cultural context, a public rebuke would serve as a powerful lesson, reinforcing the authority of the teacher and the need for alignment with divine purposes.<p><b>&#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!</b><br>This phrase is a direct and forceful rejection of Peter's words, equating them with temptation similar to that which Jesus faced in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). The use of "Satan" here symbolizes opposition to God's plan, not a literal identification of Peter with the devil. It highlights the spiritual battle and the necessity of aligning with God's will over human desires.<p><b>For you do not have in mind the things of God,</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts divine perspective with human understanding. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's ways being higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). Peter's focus on earthly concerns, such as the avoidance of suffering and death, reveals a lack of understanding of the redemptive purpose of Jesus' mission.<p><b>but the things of men.&#8221;</b><br>The "things of men" refers to human concerns, priorities, and wisdom, which often conflict with God's purposes. This phrase serves as a warning against allowing worldly perspectives to overshadow spiritual truths. It echoes the biblical call to seek first the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>) and to set one's mind on things above (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples about His mission and the nature of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong declarations of faith.

By rebuking Peter, He teaches every disciple to follow, not direct, the Lord. The cross must remain central; any impulse that minimizes it&#8212;even cloaked in good intentions&#8212;aligns with Satan&#8217;s agenda. True disciples set their minds on God&#8217;s redemptive purposes, trusting His wisdom above all human reasoning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter.</span> The words indicate a sudden movement (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), accompanied by a keen searching look at his disciples. Then he singles out Peter, and addresses to him, in their presence, the severe rebuke, <span class="cmt_word">Get thee behind me, Satan:</span> <span class="cmt_word">for thou savourest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">thou mindest not</span> -<span class="cmt_word">the things of God, but the</span> <span class="cmt_word">things of men</span>. The form of words is the same as that used by our Lord to Satan himself, when he was tempted by him in the wilderness. It reminded him of that great conflict. The visions of worldly glory again floated before him. The crown without the cross was again held out to him. This explains his language. Peter was indeed rebuked; but the rebuke was aimed through him at the arch adversary who was addressing him through Peter. Here is the striking significance of his "turning about." Peter was for the moment doing the tempter's work, and in "turning about" our Lord was again putting Satan behind him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Turning</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(epistrapheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1994.htm">Strong's 1994: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and strepho; to revert.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">looking at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
