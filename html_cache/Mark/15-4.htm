This reflects Pilate's role as a Roman official responsible for maintaining order and justice. The repeated questioning suggests Pilate's uncertainty and perhaps his desire to find a reason to release Jesus, as seen in other Gospel accounts (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>, <a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>). Pilate's questioning also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth.<p><b>&#8220;Have You no answer?</b><br>Pilate's question highlights Jesus' silence in the face of accusations, which is significant in the context of Roman trials where defendants typically defended themselves vigorously. Jesus' silence can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>) and a demonstration of His submission to God's will. It also contrasts with the typical human response to defend oneself, showcasing Jesus' unique character and mission.<p><b>Look how many charges they are bringing against You!&#8221;</b><br>The multitude of charges reflects the intense opposition Jesus faced from the Jewish leaders. These charges were likely exaggerated or false, as Pilate himself found no basis for a charge against Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14</a>). The numerous accusations underscore the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>, where false witnesses rise up against the righteous. This situation also typifies the spiritual battle Jesus faced, representing the world's rejection of Him as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who is presiding over the trial of Jesus.

Earlier he declared, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). He is looking for a reason either to release or condemn.<p>&#8226; Pilate is a Roman governor, yet he is being drawn into a spiritual drama foretold in <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>&#8212;&#8220;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?&#8221;&#8212;where earthly rulers stand against the Lord&#8217;s Anointed.<p>&#8226; The fact that Scripture records each step underscores its accuracy: every move of Pilate aligns with prophecy and divine purpose (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have You no answer?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s question highlights the startling silence of Jesus. <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> predicted, &#8220;He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus had spoken earlier (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>), but here He chooses silence, fulfilling prophecy and demonstrating meekness under unjust treatment (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The silence is not weakness; it is deliberate submission to the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate expects the accused to defend himself, as Paul would later do before Festus (<a href="/acts/25-8.htm">Acts 25:8</a>).

No earthly court can uncover guilt where none exists.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/15-4.htm">Mark 15:4</a> records a pivotal moment: Pilate presses Jesus for a defense, amazed at His silence while the religious leaders flood the room with charges. Jesus&#8217; choice not to answer fulfills prophecy, manifests perfect obedience, and exposes the emptiness of the accusations. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s plan advances even through unjust trials, and the sinless Savior stands firm, securing our redemption by His steadfast submission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - It would seem that Pilate had led Jesus out of his palace, into which the Jewish priests could not enter (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>), lest they should be defiled by entering a house from which all leaven had not been scrupulously removed. This would have been a violation of their religious scruples; and therefore he went out into the open court, and there heard the accusations of the chief priests. It is supposed that the building occupied by Pilate was the palace built or rebuilt by Herod near the gate of Jaffa, north-west of Mount Zion. It was doubtless occasionally occupied by Pilate, and it was conveniently situated, being near to Herod's palace - the old palace of the Asmoneans, between it and the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
