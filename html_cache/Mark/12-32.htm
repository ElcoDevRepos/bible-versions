In Jewish culture, scribes were experts in the Law, often involved in teaching and interpreting the Torah. This interaction highlights a rare moment of concord between Jesus and a religious leader, as many scribes and Pharisees often opposed Him. The term "Teacher" (Rabbi) was a title of respect, showing the scribe's recognition of Jesus' wisdom.<p><b>&#8220;You have stated correctly that God is One</b><br>This phrase affirms the central tenet of Jewish monotheism, rooted in the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This declaration is foundational to Jewish faith and identity, emphasizing the uniqueness and singularity of God. In the context of Jesus' ministry, this affirmation also serves to align His teachings with the core beliefs of Judaism, countering any accusations of heresy or blasphemy.<p><b>and there is no other but Him,</b><br>This statement reinforces the exclusivity of the God of Israel, rejecting the polytheistic beliefs prevalent in the surrounding cultures of the time. It echoes passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>, "I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God." This exclusivity is crucial in understanding the nature of God as presented in the Bible, emphasizing His sovereignty and the call for undivided worship. In the New Testament context, it also sets the stage for understanding Jesus' identity and mission as the embodiment of this one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts and engaging with various religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scribe.htm">The Scribe</a></b><br>A Jewish legal expert who approaches Jesus with a question about the greatest commandment and acknowledges Jesus' response.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The setting for this interaction, a place of teaching and debate in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandment_discussion.htm">The Commandment Discussion</a></b><br>The broader context of this verse involves a discussion about the greatest commandment, where Jesus emphasizes love for God and neighbor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/affirmation_of_monotheism.htm">Affirmation of Monotheism</a></b><br>The scribe's response underscores the foundational Jewish and Christian belief in one God.

Note also the real reverence shown in the form of address, "Master," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Teacher, Rabbi." He recognises the speaker as one of his own order. This, and all that follows, is peculiar to St. Mark, and is an addition of singular interest, as showing the existence among the scribes of some who accepted our Lord's teaching as to the spiritual meaning of the Law, and were able to distinguish between its essence and its accidents.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - The first words of this verse should be rendered thus: <span class="cmt_word">Of a truth, Master, thou hast well said that he is one</span>. In the remainder of the scribe's answer we find a different word used in the Greek for" mind," or "understanding," from that just used by our Lord. In our Lord's answer the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>.
