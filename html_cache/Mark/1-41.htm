Compassion is a recurring theme in the Gospels, reflecting God's nature as merciful and loving. In the cultural context of the time, lepers were often ostracized and seen as unclean, both physically and spiritually. Jesus' compassion here breaks societal norms, showing His willingness to engage with and heal those marginalized by society. This act of compassion fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah as a healer and restorer, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our infirmities.<p><b>Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man</b><br>Touching a leper was considered taboo and would render a person ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). However, Jesus' touch signifies His authority over the law and His power to purify rather than be defiled. This act symbolizes the incarnation, where Jesus, fully divine, enters into the human condition to bring healing and restoration. It also prefigures the ultimate cleansing from sin that Jesus provides through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<p><b>&#8220;I am willing,&#8221; He said</b><br>Jesus' willingness to heal reflects His divine authority and His role as the compassionate Savior. This statement underscores the readiness of God to respond to human need and suffering. It also highlights the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, where He engages directly and personally with individuals. This willingness is consistent with God's character as revealed throughout Scripture, where He desires to bring healing and restoration to His people (<a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Be clean!&#8221;</b><br>The command "Be clean!" is both a physical and spiritual declaration. In the Jewish context, cleanliness was not only about physical health but also about spiritual purity. By declaring the man clean, Jesus not only heals his physical ailment but also restores him to community and religious life. This act is a type of the greater spiritual cleansing that Jesus offers to all humanity, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, where the blood of Jesus purifies us from all sin. The immediate healing that follows demonstrates Jesus' divine power and authority, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as compassionate and willing to heal.

He moves toward the outcast, touches the untouchable, declares His readiness to save, and speaks cleansing into reality. The verse reassures us that the same Lord still reaches, touches, wills, and cleanses all who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Observe in this verse that Jesus stretched forth his hand and touched the leper. Thus he showed that he was superior to the Law, which forbade contact with a leper. He touched him, knowing that he could not be defiled with the touch. He touched him that he might heal him, and that his Divine power of healing might be made manifest. "Thus," says Bode, "God stretched out his hand and touched the human nature in his incarnation, and restored to the Church those who had been cast out, that they might be able to offer their bodies a living sacrifice to him of whom it is said, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Molchisedec.'" I will; be thou clean; literally, <span class="accented">be thou made clean</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). It is well observed here by St. Jerome that our Lord aptly answers both the petitions of the leper. "If thou wilt;" "I will." "Thou canst make me clean;" "Be thou made clean." Indeed, Christ gives him more than he asks for. He makes him whole, not only in body, but in spirit. Thus Christ, in his loving-kindness, exceeds the wishes of his supplicants, that we may learn from him to do the same, and to enlarge our hearts, both towards God and towards our brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Moved with compassion,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(splanchnistheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4697.htm">Strong's 4697: </a> </span><span class="str2">To feel compassion, have pity on, be moved. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus reached out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekteinas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1614.htm">Strong's 1614: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch out (forth), cast forth (as of an anchor), lay hands on.
