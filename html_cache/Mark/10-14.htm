It also reflects His broader mission of inclusivity and love, challenging societal norms that often marginalized the vulnerable.<p><b>and told them</b><br>Jesus directly addresses His disciples, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. His words are authoritative, correcting their misunderstanding of His mission and the nature of the Kingdom of God.<p><b>&#8220;Let the little children come to Me</b><br>Jesus invites the children, symbolizing openness and acceptance. In the cultural context, children were often seen as insignificant, yet Jesus elevates their status, illustrating the value of humility and dependence in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>and do not hinder them!</b><br>This command reinforces the importance of removing barriers to coming to Jesus.
