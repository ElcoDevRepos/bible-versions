After recognizing Jesus in the breaking of bread, they returned to Jerusalem to share the news with the other disciples. This act of reporting is significant as it demonstrates the early spread of the resurrection message, a foundational event for the Christian faith. The disciples' journey back to Jerusalem highlights the importance of the city as the center of early Christian activity and the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His message would begin there (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>).<p><b>but they did not believe them either</b><br>The skepticism of the disciples upon hearing the report reflects a recurring theme of doubt and disbelief among Jesus' followers after His resurrection. This disbelief is consistent with other Gospel accounts, such as Thomas's doubt in <a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>. The initial unbelief underscores the extraordinary nature of the resurrection and the human tendency to doubt miraculous events. It also sets the stage for Jesus' later appearances to the disciples, where He provides tangible proof of His resurrection, thus strengthening their faith and preparing them for their mission to spread the Gospel. This disbelief can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' earlier predictions of His death and resurrection, which the disciples struggled to comprehend until they witnessed the risen Christ themselves.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who were struggling with disbelief after His resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_disciples.htm">The Two Disciples</a></b><br>Likely referring to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, as described in <a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-35</a>, who encountered the risen Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rest.htm">The Rest</a></b><br>The remaining disciples and followers of Jesus who were gathered together, still in mourning and confusion over Jesus' death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_reporting.htm">The Event of Reporting</a></b><br>The act of the two disciples sharing their encounter with the risen Jesus with the rest of the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disbelief.htm">The Disbelief</a></b><br>The reaction of the rest of the disciples, who did not believe the testimony of the two disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_struggle_with_doubt.htm">The Struggle with Doubt</a></b><br>Even the closest followers of Jesus experienced doubt.
