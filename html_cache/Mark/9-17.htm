The crowd often represents the general populace who followed Jesus, seeking miracles or teachings. This context highlights the accessibility of Jesus to the common people and His willingness to engage with them.<p><b>Teacher</b><br>The term "Teacher" (Rabbi) was a respectful title used for those who taught the Jewish law. It acknowledges Jesus' authority and role as a spiritual leader. This title is significant as it shows the recognition of Jesus' wisdom and authority, even among those who may not fully understand His divine nature.<p><b>I brought You my son</b><br>This personal appeal underscores the desperation and faith of the father. Bringing his son to Jesus indicates belief in Jesus' power to heal. It reflects the cultural practice of seeking out a healer or prophet for miraculous intervention, common in Jewish tradition.<p><b>who has a spirit</b><br>The reference to "a spirit" suggests a belief in spiritual beings that could influence human behavior, a common understanding in Jewish and broader ancient Near Eastern cultures. This aligns with biblical accounts of demonic possession, which were often associated with physical and mental ailments.<p><b>that makes him mute</b><br>The specific affliction of muteness is significant, as it not only affected the boy's ability to communicate but also his social and religious participation. In Jewish culture, physical ailments were sometimes seen as a result of sin or spiritual oppression, making this healing not just a physical restoration but a social and spiritual one as well.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is the Teacher to whom the man brings his son for healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- A group of people gathered around Jesus, often seeking miracles or teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>- A desperate parent seeking help for his afflicted son, demonstrating faith in Jesus' ability to heal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>- A young boy possessed by a spirit that causes muteness, representing those in need of deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>- An unclean spirit causing physical and spiritual affliction, highlighting the reality of spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The father's approach to Jesus demonstrates active faith.

The &#8220;crowd&#8221; underscores how quickly word of Jesus&#8217; presence spreads and how desperately people look to Him for help (cf. <a href="/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9-10</a>).<p>- One voice rises above the clamor. Like the desperate father in <a href="/luke/9-38.htm">Luke 9:38</a> and the leper in <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>, this man refuses to remain silent when his child is suffering.<p>- The verse reminds us that Christ welcomes individuals out of the masses. No petition is too small or too drowned out to reach Him (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Teacher</b><p>- The father addresses Jesus with respect: &#8220;Teacher&#8221; (didaskalos). Even before the healing, he acknowledges Jesus&#8217; authority to instruct and act (<a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>).<p>- Though Jesus is more than a teacher, recognizing Him as one who imparts divine truth is the first step toward deeper faith (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p>- The title highlights the contrast between the disciples&#8217; recent failure (<a href="/mark/9-18.htm">Mark 9:18</a>) and the Master&#8217;s unfailing competence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I brought You my son</b><p>- Parental love compels action. As with Jairus (<a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22-23</a>) and the Syrophoenician woman (<a href="/mark/7-26.htm">Mark 7:26-30</a>), this father pushes through obstacles to lay his child before Jesus.<p>- Bringing someone to Jesus is an act of faith (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The father assumes Jesus cares and can help&#8212;a model for intercessory prayer today (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p>- The personal pronouns&#8212;&#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;You,&#8221; &#8220;my&#8221;&#8212;stress relationship. Faith is never merely theoretical; it is personal trust in a living Savior (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has a spirit that makes him mute</b><p>- Scripture treats demonic oppression as literal, not metaphorical (<a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The boy&#8217;s muteness is attributed to an unclean spirit, affirming the reality of spiritual warfare.<p>- Physical manifestations can flow from spiritual causes, yet Jesus&#8217; authority extends over both (<a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-13</a>).<p>- The father&#8217;s diagnosis shows he has witnessed repeated episodes. His honesty mirrors the psalmists who detail their troubles before God (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/9-17.htm">Mark 9:17</a> captures a desperate parent emerging from the crowd, addressing Jesus as &#8220;Teacher,&#8221; and presenting his afflicted son whose muteness stems from demonic oppression. The verse illustrates personal faith, the urgency of intercession, and Christ&#8217;s unique authority over both the seen and unseen. Believers today are encouraged to approach Jesus with the same candid trust, confident that He still hears, teaches, and delivers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">A dumb spirit.</span>--This, again, is peculiar to St. Mark, as is also the "gnashing of the teeth" and the "pining" or "withering" in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of the multitude answered him, Master I brought</span> - the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="cmt_word">unto thee my son</span>. He brought his son, expecting to find Jesus; but failing in this, he applied to our Lord's disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they could not. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/17-14.htm">Matthew 17:14</a>) says that the man came kneeling to Christ, "and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic." The word in the Greek there is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Etymologically, no doubt, "lunatic" conveys the meaning of the word most nearly. But the graphic description here of St. Mark corresponds exactly to epilepsy, and to epilepsy acted upon by an unclean spirit, who in this instance deprived the sufferer of his speech. Lunatics were so called from the prevailing impression, not without foundation, that the light and the changes of the moon have an influence upon the body, and so act through the body upon the mind. This influence seems to be recognized in <a href="/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>, "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Someone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
