Roman governors like Pilate were tasked with maintaining order and peace in their provinces. The Jewish leaders and the crowd were demanding Jesus' crucifixion, and Pilate, despite finding no fault in Jesus, chose to appease them to prevent unrest. This highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership, as well as the fickle nature of public opinion, which had previously hailed Jesus as a prophet and king.<p><b>Pilate released Barabbas to them</b><br>Barabbas was a known insurrectionist and murderer, yet the crowd chose him over Jesus. This choice underscores the irony and tragedy of the situation: the innocent Jesus is condemned while the guilty Barabbas is set free. This event is a powerful illustration of substitutionary atonement, where Jesus takes the place of sinners. Barabbas' release can be seen as a type of the greater spiritual release Jesus provides for humanity.<p><b>But he had Jesus flogged</b><br>Flogging, or scourging, was a brutal Roman punishment involving a whip with multiple leather thongs, often embedded with metal or bone. This punishment was intended to weaken the victim before crucifixion. The severity of the flogging Jesus endured fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who is "wounded for our transgressions." This act of violence against Jesus is a prelude to the crucifixion and highlights His physical suffering.<p><b>and handed Him over to be crucified</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious criminals and was designed to be a public deterrent. It was a shameful and excruciating death, fulfilling the curse described in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, "cursed is anyone who is hung on a tree." Jesus' crucifixion is central to Christian theology as it represents the ultimate sacrifice for sin. This act fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies, including <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, and demonstrates Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

St. Luke and St. John are more full in details here. From their narratives it appears that when Pilate found that his attempt to rescue our Lord, by putting Barabbas in contrast with him, had failed, he next hoped to move the multitude to pity by the terrible punishment of scourging, after which he trusted that they would relent. Scourging was a vile punishment, inflicted on slaves. But it was also inflicted upon those who were condemned to death, even though freemen This scourging, which was a part of the punishment of crucifixion, was of frightful severity. Horace ('Sat.' 1:3, 119) speaks of it as "horrible flagellum." But it appears from St. John (<a href="/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>) that the scourging of Jesus took place before his formal condemnation to be crucified; we may therefore suppose that it was not a part of the ordinary punishment of crucifixion. At all events, there is nothing, upon a careful comparison of the narratives, to lead us to the conclusion that our blessed Lord was scourged twice. In fact, Pilate anticipated the time of the scourging, in the vain hope that he might by this means save our Lord from the capital punishment. A comparison of the narratives of St. Matthew and St. Mark with that of St. John will make this clear; for they all three refer to one and the same scourging. Recent investigations at Jerusalem have disclosed what may probably have been the place of the punishment. In a subterranean chamber, discovered by Captain Warren, on what Mr. Fergusson holds to be the site of Antonia, Pilate's praetorium, stands a truncated column, no part of the structure itself, but just such a dwarf pillar as criminals would be tied to to be scourged. The chamber cannot be later than the time of Herod (see Professor Westcott on St. <a href="/john/19.htm">John 19</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wishing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(boulomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1014.htm">Strong's 1014: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, intend, desire, wish.
