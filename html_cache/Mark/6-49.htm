The Sea of Galilee, where this event took place, is known for sudden storms due to its geographical location. Walking on water is a direct display of Jesus' power over creation, echoing Old Testament themes where God alone treads upon the waves (<a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>). This act serves as a type of Jesus' divinity, reinforcing His identity as the Son of God. The disciples' witnessing of this miracle is crucial, as it challenges their understanding and faith, preparing them for future ministry.<p><b>they cried out</b><br>The disciples' reaction of crying out indicates their fear and astonishment. In the context of first-century Jewish culture, the sea was often seen as a symbol of chaos and danger. Their cry can be seen as a natural human response to encountering the supernatural. This moment of fear contrasts with Jesus' calm authority, highlighting the disciples' need for faith and understanding of Jesus' true nature.<p><b>thinking He was a ghost&#8212;</b><br>The belief in ghosts or spirits was common in ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman cultures. The disciples' assumption that Jesus was a ghost reflects their initial inability to comprehend His divine power. This misunderstanding underscores their journey from fear to faith, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. The notion of Jesus as a ghost also contrasts with His physical resurrection, which later affirms His victory over death and the spiritual realm. This moment foreshadows the disciples' eventual recognition of Jesus' true identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who demonstrates His divine authority by walking on water.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are in the boat on the Sea of Galilee, witnessing this miraculous event.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A significant body of water in the region where many of Jesus' miracles and teachings took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_walking_on_water.htm">The Event of Walking on Water</a></b><br>A miraculous demonstration of Jesus' power over nature, intended to reveal His divine identity to the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cry_of_fear.htm">The Cry of Fear</a></b><br>The disciples' reaction, thinking they saw a ghost, which reflects their lack of understanding and faith at that moment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to walk on water is a testament to His divine nature and authority over creation.

Compare <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a> where He says, &#8220;In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;but&#8221; to signal God&#8217;s unexpected intervention (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>, &#8220;But God, who is rich in mercy&#8230;&#8221;). Here the intervention is not only unexpected&#8212;it is literally supernatural.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they saw Him</b><p>&#8226; In the storm they weren&#8217;t expecting Jesus; they were simply trying to stay alive. Their vision is clouded by wind-blown spray and fear.<p>&#8226; Other moments reveal the same pattern: seeing Jesus yet not recognizing Him at first (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a> on the Emmaus road; <a href="/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a> on the shore). Human sight alone is never enough; spiritual insight is needed (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord often lets us reach the end of our own resources so we will truly &#8220;see&#8221; Him (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Walking on the sea</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a> says God &#8220;treads on the waves of the sea.&#8221; By doing the same, Jesus unmistakably displays divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> reminds us, &#8220;Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.&#8221; What was unseen in the Exodus becomes visible in Christ.<p>&#8226; Earlier Jesus calmed a storm with a word (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). Now He strolls on the very waters that threaten the disciples, proving yet again that &#8220;all things were created through Him and for Him&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They cried out</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/6-50.htm">Mark 6:50</a> notes they &#8220;were all terrified.&#8221; Raw emotion erupts; seasoned fishermen shriek like children.<p>&#8226; Similar cries fill Scripture: the psalmist &#8220;called out to the LORD in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>) and the Israelites &#8220;cried out&#8221; at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10</a>). God hears every cry (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear can be a doorway to faith when it drives us to call on Jesus (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thinking He was a ghost</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a> adds, &#8220;They cried out in fear, &#8216;It is a ghost!&#8217; &#8221; First-century Jews, like many today, had shadowy ideas about spirits inhabiting dark waters.<p>&#8226; After the resurrection, Jesus&#8217; followers again mistake Him for a spirit until He shows His hands and feet (<a href="/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37-39</a>). The pattern underscores how easily human understanding misfires without divine revelation.<p>&#8226; Christ dispels superstition by speaking: &#8220;Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-50.htm">Mark 6:50</a>).

Their terrified cry reveals human frailty; Jesus&#8217; approach on the waves reveals divine mastery. The verse reminds us that when circumstances feel chaotic and vision is blurred, the Lord is still sovereign, still present, and still speaks the words our trembling hearts need most: &#8220;Do not be afraid.&#8221;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">but</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when they saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(idontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
