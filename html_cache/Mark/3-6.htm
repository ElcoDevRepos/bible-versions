Up to now, Jesus has been healing, teaching, extending mercy&#8212;especially in the synagogue where He restored the man&#8217;s withered hand (<a href="/mark/3-1.htm">Mark 3:1-5</a>). That merciful act should have evoked praise, yet it provokes hostility. Here&#8217;s why:<p>&#8226; It exposed the hardness of religious hearts (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It revealed that Sabbath regulations had become more precious to the leaders than people (<a href="/luke/14-3.htm">Luke 14:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; It forced a decision&#8212;either follow the Messiah&#8217;s authority or resist Him (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Pharisees went out</b><p>Leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees step outside both physically and spiritually.

This was a terrible crisis in his history, or rather in the history of those unbelieving men. They are now in this dilemma: they must either accept his teaching, or they must take steps against him as a sabbath-breaker. But what had he done? The miracle had been wrought by a word only. It would have been difficult, therefore, to have obtained a judgment against him. Therefore they secured some fresh allies. They had already gained to their side some of the disciples of John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/2-18.htm">Mark 2:18</a>), now they associate with themselves the Herodians. This is the first mention that we find made of the Herodians. They were the natural opponents of the Pharisees; but here they seem to have found some common ground of agreement, though it is not very easy to say what it was, in combining against our Lord. But it is no uncommon thing to find coalitions of men, strangely opposed to one another on most points, but united to effect some particular object; and it is easy to see how the purity and spirituality of our Lord and of his doctrine would be opposed, on the one hand, to the ceremonial formality of the Pharisee, and on the other to the worldly and secular spirit of the Herodian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
