It was a region known for its pagan worship, particularly of the Greek god Pan, and had a temple dedicated to Caesar Augustus. This setting highlights the contrast between the pagan beliefs of the area and the revelation of Jesus' true identity. The journey to this region signifies a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, as He begins to reveal more about His mission and identity to His disciples. The location also serves as a backdrop for Peter's confession of Jesus as the Messiah, emphasizing the spiritual battle between the kingdom of God and the pagan world.<p><b>On the way, He questioned His disciples:</b><br>The phrase "on the way" suggests a teaching moment during travel, a common practice of Jesus. This journey was not just physical but also spiritual, as Jesus prepared His disciples for deeper truths about His identity and mission. The questioning indicates a Socratic method of teaching, encouraging the disciples to reflect and articulate their understanding. This approach was crucial for their growth and preparation for future ministry.<p><b>&#8220;Who do people say I am?&#8221;</b><br>This question addresses the various opinions and rumors circulating about Jesus' identity. At this point in His ministry, Jesus had performed numerous miracles and taught with authority, leading to widespread speculation. Some believed He was John the Baptist resurrected, others thought He was Elijah or another prophet. This question sets the stage for the more personal and direct question that follows, "But who do you say I am?" It challenges the disciples to move beyond public opinion and recognize Jesus' true nature. This moment is a turning point, as it leads to Peter's confession and Jesus' subsequent teaching about His suffering and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, the Son of God, who is teaching and leading His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught and tested in their understanding of His identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea_philippi.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a></b><br>A region known for its pagan worship and diverse religious beliefs, providing a backdrop for Jesus' question about His identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_identity.htm">Understanding Jesus' Identity</a></b><br>Recognizing who Jesus is remains a foundational aspect of Christian faith.

This verse seems to corroborate the view that the Bethsaida just referred to was Bethsaida Julias. Caesarea Philippi lies at the roots of Libanus. Cornelius a Lapide says that it was originally celled Dan, the place where two little streams united, namely, Jeor and Daniel These two streamlets so united make the Jordan, whence the name Jeer-Dan, or Jordan. But since Pan, the God of shepherds, was better known to the Gentiles than Dan, a Hebrew tribe, it was hence called by them "Paneas.' It is celled Bahias at the present day. It lay at the extreme north, as Beersheba lay at the extreme south. Hence the phrase, "from Dan even to Beersheba." On this account many neighboring Gentiles, especially the Phoenicians, flocked to this city, as is frequently the case with border towns. And so Christ visited this neighborhood, not only because it presented favorable opportunities to him for teaching Jews and Gentiles alike, but also that he might speak more freely than he could have done in Judaea concerning a Messiah, whom the Jews expected as their king. in Judaea itself, and especially in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, it would have been perilous to speak on such a subject; for the scribes would at once have accused him to the Roman power that he was seeking the kingdom. The student who wishes for further information respecting the site of Caesarea Philippi may consult with advantage Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (ch. 11, "The Lake of Merom and the sources of the Jordan" ). A more familiar derivation of the Jordan than that given by A Lapide is that of the "descender," from Jarad, "to descend." Our Lord went from Bethsaida Julias directly northwards towards Paneas, named by Philip the Tetrach Caesarea Philippi, to distinguish it from the other Caesarea in Samaria on the Mediterranean coast. It will be observed that he went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi, avoiding the city itself. <span class="cmt_word">In the way thither he asked his disciples,... Who do men say that I am?</span> This incident is mentioned also by St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-18.htm">Luke 9:18</a>) says that he was alone praying, his disciples being doubtless not far off. According to this evangelist, our Lord says, "Who do the multitudes say that I am? "thus distinguishing them more particularly from his own disciples. The common people among the Jews knew that not long after the Babylonish Captivity the gift of prophecy had ceased amongst their nation. So they thought that Christ was not a new Prophet, but one of the old. They could not but see in him the renewal of the powers of the old prophets, their miracles and their teaching; but there were very few of them who believed that he was the Messiah. The great body of them were offended at his poverty and humility; for they thought that Messiah would appear amongst them with royal state as a temporal king. So that when some said, moved it might be by the sight of his miracles, "This is that Prophet that should come into the world," they did but give utterance to a momentary and fugitive feeling, and not a firm or abiding conviction. The mass of mankind are fickle, easily led to change their opinions. Perhaps some of the Jewish multitude thought that the soul of one of the ancient prophets had entered into Christ, according to the Pythagorean notion of the transmigration of souls; or perhaps they thought that one of the old prophets had risen again in the person of Jesus. For though the Sadducees denied a resurrection, the great body of the Jews believed in it. Some thought that Christ was John the Baptist, because he resembled the Baptist in age (there was only six months difference in ago between them), as he also resembled him in holiness and in fervor of preaching. It was but a short time before, that John the Baptist had been put to death by Herod. His character and actions were fresh in their memories; and Herod himself had given currency to the idea that the Baptist had risen again in the person of our Lord. Then there was Elijah. Some thought that our Lord was Elijah, because it was known that Elijah had not died, and because there was an expectation, founded on Malachi's prophecy (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>), that he would return. They thought, therefore, that Elijah had returned, and that our Lord was Elijah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
