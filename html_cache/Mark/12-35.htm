The temple was not only a religious center but also a place for public discourse and debate. Jesus often taught in the temple, engaging with both followers and religious leaders. The temple courts were accessible to all, allowing Jesus to reach a broad audience. This setting emphasizes the public nature of His teaching and the authority with which He spoke.<p><b>He asked</b><br>Jesus often used questions as a teaching method to provoke thought and challenge prevailing assumptions. By asking questions, He engaged His listeners, encouraging them to reflect deeply on their beliefs and understanding of Scripture. This method was effective in revealing the hearts and minds of His audience, often exposing their misunderstandings or lack of insight.<p><b>&#8220;How can the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</b><br>The scribes were experts in the Jewish Law and were responsible for teaching and interpreting the Scriptures. They held that the Messiah, or Christ, would be a descendant of David, based on prophecies such as <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. This belief was widely accepted in Jewish tradition. However, Jesus challenges this understanding by questioning how the Messiah could be merely David's son. This question points to the dual nature of the Messiah as both human and divine, suggesting that the Christ is greater than David. Jesus is leading His audience to consider the full identity of the Messiah, which includes His divine sonship, as later affirmed in passages like <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts, challenging the prevailing understanding of the Messiah's identity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders and scholars of the Law who taught that the Messiah would be a descendant of David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The public area of the temple in Jerusalem where Jesus often taught and engaged with both followers and religious leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, revered as a man after God's own heart, and the one through whom the Messiah was prophesied to come.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Messiah)</a></b><br>The anointed one, expected to be a descendant of David, who would deliver Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_messiah's_identity.htm">Understanding the Messiah's Identity</a></b><br>Jesus challenges the limited understanding of the Messiah as merely a political or earthly descendant of David.

Thus, as ever, he returned good for evil. He here taught them that the Messiah was not a mere man, as they supposed, but that he was i both God and man, and that therefore they ought not to wonder or to be offended because he called himself the Son of God. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>) more fully gives their answer first, namely, that "Christ is the Son of David." They should have said that, as God, he was the Son of God, according to those words, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" but that, as man, he was the Son of David. Their answer was very different from that of Peter: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." But they wanted the Divine knowledge which the disciples had gained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] was teaching</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(didask&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1321.htm">Strong's 1321: </a> </span><span class="str2">To teach, direct, admonish.
