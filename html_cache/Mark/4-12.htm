In the context of <a href="/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>, Jesus explains that parables serve a dual function: revealing truths to those open to understanding and concealing them from those who are not. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine sovereignty in revealing or concealing truth (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-26</a>).<p><b>&#8216;they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,</b><br>This phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God commissions Isaiah to deliver a message to a people who will not understand. The repetition of "seeing" without "perceiving" suggests a superficial engagement with spiritual truths. In the Gospels, the religious leaders often saw Jesus' miracles but failed to perceive His divine nature and mission (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).<p><b>and ever hearing but never understanding;</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this highlights the distinction between physical hearing and spiritual understanding. The Jewish audience of Jesus' time had access to the Scriptures and teachings of the prophets, yet many failed to grasp the fulfillment of these prophecies in Christ. This reflects a hardened heart, a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>).<p><b>otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the potential for repentance and forgiveness if true understanding is achieved. It implies that spiritual blindness prevents repentance. The concept of turning, or repentance, is central to the Gospel message (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). Forgiveness is a key aspect of Jesus' ministry, offering redemption to those who believe (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>).

Turning is always welcomed, but hearts must first soften.<p>&#8226;Paul explains a similar hardening in <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8&#8211;11</a>, showing that God&#8217;s plan can use human stubbornness while still inviting repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and be forgiven</b><p>Forgiveness is ready, purchased, and offered&#8212;yet it is not forced.<p>&#8226;Mark opens with Jesus proclaiming, &#8220;Repent and believe the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226;Ephesians celebrates &#8220;redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226;1 John promises, &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>In <a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> the spotlight falls on the tragic irony: those who refuse to see and hear are shutting the door on the very forgiveness Christ longs to give.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> teaches that parables reveal truth to receptive hearts while confirming blindness in the hardened. Seeing without perceiving and hearing without understanding expose a willful resistance foretold in Isaiah. Yet the invitation remains: if they would only turn, they would be forgiven. The verse is both a warning against spiritual dullness and a reminder that forgiveness stands ready for all who respond in humble faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">That seeing they may see</span>. . . .--St. Mark characteristically gives the words of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9</a>, but not as a quotation, and perhaps in a less accurate form, and omits the addition in Matthew, "Blessed are your ears . . ." The form in this instance, at first sight, suggests the thought that our Lord's purpose was to produce the blindness and deafness of which He speaks. The real meaning of the words is, however, plain. This was to be the result of the wilful blindness of those who rejected Him; and the acceptance of a foreseen result was, in Hebrew forms of thought, expressed as the working out of an intention.
