The transfiguration had been a moment of divine revelation, and the sudden shift back to normalcy underscores the temporary nature of such experiences. This mirrors other biblical moments where divine encounters are brief, such as Moses' encounter with God on Mount Sinai.<p><b>when they looked around</b><br>The disciples, Peter, James, and John, were the witnesses to the transfiguration. Their looking around suggests a return to awareness of their surroundings after being overwhelmed by the vision of Jesus' glory. This moment of realization is similar to other biblical instances where individuals come back to their senses after a divine encounter, such as Daniel after his visions.<p><b>they saw no one with them</b><br>This phrase highlights the departure of Moses and Elijah, who had appeared with Jesus. Their presence symbolized the Law and the Prophets, affirming Jesus' fulfillment of both. The disappearance of these figures signifies the completion of their roles and the focus on Jesus as the central figure of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>except Jesus</b><br>The focus returns solely to Jesus, emphasizing His preeminence and sufficiency. This aligns with the New Testament theme that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). It also reflects the theological truth that Jesus is the sole mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).

The suddenness stresses God&#8217;s control, the looking around shows a return to earthly perception, the absence of Moses and Elijah signals the fulfillment of Law and Prophets, and the solitary presence of Christ declares His unmatched supremacy. For every believer, the verse points to a life centered not on past figures or fading experiences, but on the abiding, all-sufficient Lord Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves</span>. St. Matthew here says (<a href="/matthew/17-6.htm">Matthew 17:6</a>), "When the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sere afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid." St. Mark omits this; but in his characteristic manner states that which implies what St. Matthew has recorded. It was the "touch" of Jesus that caused them to look round about; and then in a moment they perceived that they were alone with Jesus, as they were before this manifestation began. The order of incidents in the Transfiguration appears to have been this: Our Lord is praying. The disciples, fatigued with the ascent of the mountain, are heavy with sleep; and Christ is transfigured. Then appear Moses and Elijah; and they are talking with Jesus about his exodus - his decease to be accomplished at Jerusalem. The disciples mused from their sleep by the supernatural brightness, and by the conversation, and now, fully awake, behold the glory of Jesus, and Hoses and Elijah talking with him. As Moses and Elijah are preparing for their departure, Peter, excited, enchanted, bewildered, and yet grieved to see that they were going, seeks to detain them by the proposal to make some temporary resting-place for them. Then comes the bright overshadowing cloud, and a voice out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son: hear ye him." At the sound of this voice the disciples fall terrified to the earth. But they are soon comforted by Christ, and, looking up, they see him alone with themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Suddenly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#940;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(exapina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1819.htm">Strong's 1819: </a> </span><span class="str2">Suddenly, unexpectedly.
