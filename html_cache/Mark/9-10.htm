In the context of <a href="/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>, Jesus has just been transfigured before Peter, James, and John, and they have witnessed a glimpse of His divine glory. The instruction to keep the matter private may also relate to Jesus' frequent commands for secrecy regarding His identity and works (<a href="/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>). This secrecy is often interpreted as a way to prevent misunderstandings about His mission as the Messiah, which was not to be a political liberator but a suffering servant.<p><b>discussing what it meant</b><br>The disciples' discussion indicates their struggle to comprehend Jesus' prediction of His death and resurrection. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where the disciples often misunderstand Jesus' teachings (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31-33</a>). The concept of resurrection was not entirely foreign to Jewish thought, as seen in the Pharisees' belief in the resurrection of the dead (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>), but the idea of the Messiah rising from the dead was perplexing to them. This discussion highlights their need for further revelation and understanding, which would come after Jesus' resurrection and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2).<p><b>to rise from the dead</b><br>The phrase "to rise from the dead" is central to Christian doctrine, emphasizing the resurrection as a pivotal event in salvation history. In the Old Testament, there are allusions to resurrection, such as in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> and <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, which speak of the dead rising. Jesus' resurrection is a fulfillment of these prophecies and serves as a type of firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). The resurrection is also a testament to Jesus' victory over sin and death, affirming His divine nature and the hope of eternal life for believers (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9-10</a>). The disciples' struggle to understand this concept underscores the radical nature of Jesus' mission and the transformative power of His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, whose teachings and actions are the focus of the disciples' discussions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples who witnessed the Transfiguration and are now pondering Jesus' statement about rising from the dead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John, revealing His divine glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_transfiguration.htm">Mount of Transfiguration</a></b><br>The location where the Transfiguration took place, traditionally identified as Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The concept of rising from the dead, which the disciples are trying to understand in the context of Jesus' teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>The disciples' confusion highlights the importance of seeking a deeper understanding of the resurrection.

No doubt the general resurrection at the end of the world was an article of faith with which the disciples were familiar. But they could not understand, when he spake of his own immediate rising from the dead. So their perplexities led them at last to ask him the question; or rather to make the remark to him, The scribes say that Elijah must first come; with a view to obtaining some clearer understanding. They had just seen Elijah in the Transfiguration, and they had seen him disappear. They wondered why he should have departed. They thought, it may be, that he ought to have remained, that he might be the forerunner of Christ and of his kingdom and glory, according to the prophecy of Malachi (<a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>). This the scribes taught; but they erred in the confusion of times, for they did not distinguish the first coming of Christ in the flesh from his second advent to judgment. The thought upon the mind of the disciples appears to have been this: They heard Christ speak of his own resurrection as close at hand, and they had seen the type of it in his transfiguration; and they thought that immediately after that, Christ's kingdom would come, and he would reign gloriously. Why, then, had not Elijah remained, that he might be his precursor? St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/17-13.htm">Matthew 17:13</a>) tells us that our Lord's words which follow showed the disciples that when he said that Elijah was to come first and restore all things, he meant them to understand" that he spake unto them of John the Baptist." Upon the question of a future coming of Elijah, it seems safest to confess our ignorance. The prophecy of Malachi was no doubt in part fulfilled in the coming of John the Baptist; but it would be rash to affirm that it may not receive another and more literal fulfillment before the second advent. A host of ancient Christian expositors have held that Elijah will appear in person before the second advent of Christ. St. Augustine, in his 'City of God' (20:29), says, "Not without reason do we hope that before the coming of our Judge and Savior Elias will come, because we have good reason to believe that he is now alive; for, as Holy Scripture distinctly informs us, he gas taken up from this life in a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come he shall give a spiritual explanation of the Law which the Jews at present understand carnally, and will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers; that is, the Jews who are the children will understand the Law in the same sense as their fathers the prophets understood it." Indeed, this is one of the principal reasons assigned by the Fathers for this appearance of Elijah, that he may convert the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they kept</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekrat&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2902.htm">Strong's 2902: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kratos; to use strength, i.e. Seize or retain.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
