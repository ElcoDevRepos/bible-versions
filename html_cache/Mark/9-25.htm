In the Gospels, crowds often gather around Jesus, drawn by His teachings and miraculous works. This setting underscores the public nature of Jesus' ministry and the widespread interest in His actions. The crowd's presence also emphasizes the urgency and importance of the miracle about to occur, as Jesus often performed miracles in front of many witnesses to demonstrate His divine authority.<p><b>He rebuked the unclean spirit</b><br>The act of rebuking the unclean spirit demonstrates Jesus' authority over demonic forces. In Jewish culture, unclean spirits were associated with impurity and opposition to God's holiness. Jesus' ability to command such spirits reflects His divine power and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's authority over evil (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). This rebuke is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus exercises authority over demons, showcasing His role as the ultimate deliverer.<p><b>&#8220;You deaf and mute spirit,&#8221; He said</b><br>By identifying the spirit as "deaf and mute," Jesus addresses the specific afflictions it caused in the boy. This highlights the personal and compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry, as He directly confronts the source of the boy's suffering. The specificity of the command also demonstrates Jesus' knowledge and understanding of the spiritual realm, affirming His omniscience. This encounter parallels other Gospel accounts where Jesus heals individuals with physical and spiritual ailments, emphasizing His holistic approach to healing.<p><b>&#8220;I command you to come out and never enter him again.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command is authoritative and final, illustrating His power to not only expel the spirit but also to prevent its return. This reflects the completeness of Jesus' deliverance and His ability to provide lasting freedom from spiritual bondage. The command to "never enter him again" assures the boy's permanent liberation, contrasting with the temporary relief offered by other exorcists of the time. This act of deliverance is a foretaste of the ultimate victory over evil that Jesus would achieve through His death and resurrection, fulfilling the promise of redemption and restoration for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who demonstrates His authority over unclean spirits.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people who gather to witness the event, highlighting the public nature of Jesus' ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirit.htm">The Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>A malevolent entity possessing a boy, described as deaf and mute, which Jesus commands to leave.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boy.htm">The Boy</a></b><br>The individual afflicted by the unclean spirit, representing those in need of deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the broader context and are learning from Jesus' actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' command over the unclean spirit demonstrates His divine authority.

Then he came forward, and with a voice of sublime authority he said, <span class="cmt_word">Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him and enter no more into him.</span> The rest of the narrative shows how malignant and powerful this evil spirit was, who dared so to resist and defy Christ that, in his departure out of the afflicted boy, he almost robbed him of life. "Most unwillingly," says Archbishop Trench, "does the evil spirit depart, seeking to destroy that which he can no longer retain." And he quotes Fuller, who says that he is "like an outgoing tenant, that cares not what mischief he does to the house that he is quitting." Some have supposed that this was an evil spirit possessed of more than ordinary power as well as malignity, and that this was the reason why our Lord's disciples could not cast him out; so that this expulsion needed the mighty arm of One stronger than the strong. The words in the Greek are powerful, severe, and authoritative: "He rebuked (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) the unclean spirit, ... Thou dumb and deaf spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>), I command thee (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), come out of him, and enter no more into him." This explains our Lord's words when the disciples remarked afterwards, <span class="cmt_word">We could not out it out... This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer</span>; that is, this particular kind of malicious spirit. For there are different degrees of malice and energy in evil spirits as in evil men. The words "and fasting" are added in many ancient authorities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a crowd</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8004;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ochlos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3793.htm">Strong's 3793: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of echo; a throng; by implication, the rabble; by extension, a class of people; figuratively, a riot.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had come running,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(episyntrechei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1998.htm">Strong's 1998: </a> </span><span class="str2">To run together again.
