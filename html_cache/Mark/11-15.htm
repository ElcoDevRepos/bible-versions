Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life, was especially crowded during Passover, a time when Jews from all over the world came to worship. The arrival in Jerusalem signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' journey towards His ultimate sacrifice. This event is a pivotal moment in the Passion Week, leading to His crucifixion.<p><b>Jesus entered the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts refer to the outer courts of the Temple in Jerusalem, specifically the Court of the Gentiles. This area was meant to be a place of prayer for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). The Temple was the heart of Jewish worship and the place where God's presence dwelt among His people. Jesus' entry into the temple courts symbolizes His authority over religious practices and His role as the true High Priest.<p><b>and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there</b><br>The buying and selling in the temple courts were related to the sacrificial system. Pilgrims needed to purchase animals for sacrifices, and money changers exchanged foreign currency for the temple tax. However, this commercial activity had become exploitative and distracted from the temple's true purpose. Jesus' actions reflect His zeal for pure worship and His condemnation of corruption within religious practices, echoing the prophetic call for justice and righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>).<p><b>He overturned the tables of the money changers</b><br>Money changers were necessary because the temple tax had to be paid in a specific currency. However, they often charged exorbitant fees, exploiting worshippers. By overturning their tables, Jesus demonstrated His authority to cleanse the temple and restore it to a house of prayer. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>, where the Lord comes to purify the temple.<p><b>and the seats of those selling doves</b><br>Doves were the offerings of the poor, as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>. By targeting those selling doves, Jesus highlighted the exploitation of the most vulnerable worshippers. His actions emphasize His concern for justice and compassion for the marginalized. This cleansing of the temple foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice, which would render the sacrificial system obsolete, as He becomes the perfect offering for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating righteous anger and authority in cleansing the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is located, a significant place for Jewish worship and pilgrimage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer area of the temple where commercial activities were taking place, intended for worship and prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/money_changers.htm">Money Changers</a></b><br>Individuals who exchanged foreign currency for temple currency, often exploiting worshippers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sellers_of_doves.htm">Sellers of Doves</a></b><br>Merchants selling animals for sacrifices, which were required for temple rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger.htm">Righteous Anger</a></b><br>Jesus' actions demonstrate that there is a place for righteous anger when God's holiness is compromised.

Our Lord was not a Levitical priest, because he was not sprung of Levi and Aaron. Therefore he could not enter the holy place, but only the outer court of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">And began to cast</span> <span class="cmt_word">out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) - it was a forcible expulsion - <span class="cmt_word">them</span> <span class="cmt_word">that sold and them that bought in the temple</span>. There were two occasions on which our Lord thus purged the temple - one at the beginning of his public ministry, and the other at the end of it, four days before his death. There was a regular market in the outer court,' the court of the Gentiles, belonging to the family of the high priest. The booths of this market are mentioned in the rabbinical writings as the booths of the son of Hanan, or Annas. But this market is never mentioned in the Old Testament. It seems to have sprung up after the Captivity. Our Lord adopted these strong measures <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the temple courts were not the proper places for merchandise, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because these transactions were often dishonest, on account of the avarice and covetousness of the priests. The priests, either themselves or by their families, sold oxen and sheep and doves to those who had need to offer them in the temple. These animals were, of course, needed for sacrifices; and there was good reason why they should be ready at hand for those who came up to worship. But the sin of the priests lay in permitting this buying and selling to go on within the sacred precincts, and in trading dishonestly. There were other things needed for the sacrifices, such as wine, and salt, and oil. Then there were also the <span class="cmt_word">money-changers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a small coin) - those who exchanged large coins for smaller, or foreign money for the half-shekel. Every Israelite, whether rich or poor, was required to give the half-shekel, neither less nor more. So when money had to be exchanged, an allowance or premium was required by the money-changer. Doves or pigeons were required on various occasions for offerings, chiefly by the poor, who could not afford more costly offerings. From these also the priests had their gain. <span class="cmt_word">The seats of them that sold</span> <span class="cmt_word">the doves.</span> These birds were often sold by women, who were provided with seats. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they arrived</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchontai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7993;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Hierosolyma)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2414.htm">Strong's 2414: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Greek form of the Hebrew name: Jerusalem.
