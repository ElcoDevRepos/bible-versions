John&#8217;s disciples were likely in close communication with him and were deeply affected by his death. The news of his beheading would have spread quickly, given John's prominence as a prophet and his role in preparing the way for Jesus. This event highlights the dangerous political and religious climate of the time, where speaking truth to power could lead to martyrdom. The disciples' loyalty to John is evident, as they remained committed to him even after his death.<p><b>they came and took his body</b><br>The act of retrieving John's body demonstrates the disciples' devotion and respect for their teacher. In Jewish culture, proper burial was of utmost importance, and leaving a body unburied was considered a great dishonor. By taking his body, the disciples ensured that John received a dignified burial, in accordance with Jewish customs. This action also reflects the courage of the disciples, as they risked their own safety to honor John, who had been executed by a powerful ruler.<p><b>and placed it in a tomb</b><br>The burial of John the Baptist in a tomb signifies the end of his earthly ministry but also serves as a precursor to the burial of Jesus. Tombs were typically carved out of rock and used by families to bury their dead, indicating that John's disciples provided him with a respectful and traditional burial. This act of placing John in a tomb parallels the burial of Jesus, who was also laid in a tomb after His crucifixion. The burial of John can be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus' own death and burial, and ultimately His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his call to repentance and baptizing Jesus.

Josephus says that after the beheading, the mutilated remains were east out of the prison and left neglected. God's judgments at length found out Herod. For not long after this he was defeated by Aretas in a great battle, and put to an ignominious flight. Herodias herself and Herod were banished by a decree of the Roman Senate to Lyons, where they both perished miserably; and Nicephorus relates that Salome, the daughter of Herodias, died by a remarkable visitation. She fell through some treacherous ice over which she was passing, and fell through it in such a manner that her head was caught while the rest of her body sank into the water, and thus it came to pass that in her efforts to save herself her head was nearly severed by the sharp edges of the broken ice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[John&#8217;s]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
