This is significant in the cultural context where women often had a lower social status. By calling her "Daughter," Jesus not only acknowledges her faith but also restores her dignity and identity. This term is unique in the Gospels, highlighting the personal and compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>&#8220;your faith has healed you.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the importance of faith in the healing process. In the biblical context, faith is often portrayed as a key component in receiving God's blessings and miracles. This statement connects to other instances in the Gospels where faith is a prerequisite for healing, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a> and <a href="/luke/17-19.htm">Luke 17:19</a>. It underscores the belief that faith is not merely intellectual assent but a trust and reliance on Jesus' power and authority.<p><b>Go in peace</b><br>"Go in peace" is a common Jewish farewell, but in this context, it carries a deeper spiritual meaning. It signifies not only the cessation of physical suffering but also the restoration of wholeness and well-being. Peace, or "shalom" in Hebrew, encompasses completeness, safety, and welfare. This blessing of peace is a foretaste of the ultimate peace that Jesus brings, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where He is called the "Prince of Peace."<p><b>and be free of your affliction.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "be free of your affliction" indicates a complete and permanent healing. The woman's condition, which had lasted for twelve years, is now fully resolved. This healing is not just physical but also social and spiritual, as her condition would have made her ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>). By healing her, Jesus restores her ability to participate in community and worship. This act prefigures the ultimate freedom from sin and death that Jesus offers through His death and resurrection, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who heals the woman and acknowledges her faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>- She had been suffering for twelve years and was healed by her faith in Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- The multitude surrounding Jesus, through which the woman had to push to touch His garment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>- While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, this event occurs during Jesus' ministry in the region around Capernaum.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>- The miraculous healing of the woman, which demonstrates Jesus' power and the importance of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_a_catalyst_for_healing.htm">Faith as a Catalyst for Healing</a></b><br>The woman's faith was the key to her healing.

Compare His similar address in <a href="/luke/8-48.htm">Luke 8:48</a>, reminding us that those who receive Him become children of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; By publicly calling her &#8220;Daughter,&#8221; He restores her dignity before the crowd, affirming that she is no longer defined by her disease but by her relationship with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your faith has healed you</b><p>&#8226; Faith is the hand that reaches out; Christ is the One who heals. Her touch did not manipulate power but expressed confident trust in Jesus&#8217; willingness and ability to save (<a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links faith to Christ&#8217;s saving work: &#8220;your faith has made you well&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>). Yet the credit rests squarely on Him (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; This healing is both physical and emblematic of the greater salvation He offers, echoing <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go in peace</b><p>&#8226; Peace (shalom) means wholeness&#8212;body, soul, and relationship with God. Jesus grants more than the end of bleeding; He grants reconciliation and rest (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Walking away in peace signals a restored standing in the community she once avoided (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25&#8211;27</a>). Paul later describes this settled peace that &#8220;surpasses all understanding&#8221; guarding hearts and minds in Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a> assures perfect peace to those whose minds are fixed on the Lord, exactly what this woman now experiences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and be free of your affliction</b><p>&#8226; The deliverance is complete and enduring&#8212;&#8220;be free&#8221; carries the idea of continual release. After twelve unrelenting years, the bondage ends (<a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus confirms the permanence of her cure, unlike the temporary help she sought from physicians. Peter echoes this total healing in Christ: &#8220;by His stripes you were healed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical freedom previews spiritual liberation. As He later says of another sufferer, &#8220;should not this woman&#8230;be set free?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>). The statement encourages believers to trust Him for lasting freedom from every bondage (<a href="/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a> shows Jesus publicly restoring a broken woman to full life. He calls her &#8220;Daughter,&#8221; grounding her identity in His family; acknowledges that her faith, resting entirely on Him, is the means of healing; sends her away with the peace only He can give; and declares her permanently free from her torment. In one sentence Christ reveals His compassionate heart, the necessity of faith, and the comprehensive salvation He still offers to all who come to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Go in peace.</span>--The phrase has become so idiomatic that we dare not change it, but it may be well to remember that the true meaning of the Greek is "Go <span class= "ital">into</span> peace."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Our Lord here reassures this trembling woman, who feared, it may be, lest, because she had abstracted the blessing secretly, he might punish her with a return of her malady. On the contrary, he confirms the benefit, and bids her be whole of her plague. The Greek expression here is stronger than that which is given as the rendering of what she had used when we read that she said within herself, "I shall be saved (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." Here our Lord says, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Go in peace, and be whole</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>). It is as though he said, "It is not the mere fringe of my garment, which you have touched with great faith, and with some hope of obtaining a cure - it is not this that has cured you. You owe your healing to my omnipotence and your faith. Your faith (itself my gift) has delivered you from your issue of blood; and this deliverance I now confirm and ratify. 'Go in peace.'" The original Greek here (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) implies more than this. It means "Go for peace." Pass into the realm, the element of peace, in which henceforth thy life shall move. It is here obvious to remark that this malady represents to us the ever-flowing bitter fountain of sin, for which no styptic treatment can be found in human philosophy. The remedy is only to be found in Christ. To touch Christ's garment is to believe in his incarnation, whereby he has touched us, and so has enabled us by faith to touch him, and to receive his blessing of peace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Daughter,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#965;&#947;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(Thygat&#275;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2364.htm">Strong's 2364: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently a primary word; a female child, or descendant.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said [Jesus],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
