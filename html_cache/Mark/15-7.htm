His name means "son of the father" in Aramaic, which is ironic given the choice between him and Jesus, the true Son of the Father. This choice highlights the rejection of Jesus by the people, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>was imprisoned with the rebels</b><br>Barabbas was not alone in his imprisonment; he was part of a group involved in a rebellion. This suggests a political motivation, as insurrections against Roman rule were not uncommon in Judea. The presence of rebels indicates the volatile political climate of the time, with many Jews seeking to overthrow Roman authority.<p><b>who had committed murder</b><br>The charge of murder underscores the severity of Barabbas's crimes. Unlike Jesus, who was innocent, Barabbas was guilty of a capital offense. This contrast serves to highlight the injustice of the crowd's choice, as they preferred a known criminal over the sinless Christ.<p><b>during the insurrection</b><br>The insurrection refers to a specific uprising against Roman rule, though the exact event is not detailed in the Gospels. Such uprisings were frequent, reflecting the Jewish desire for liberation from Roman oppression. This context emphasizes the political tension present during Jesus' trial and crucifixion, as well as the expectation of a Messiah who would deliver Israel from foreign domination.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barabbas.htm">Barabbas</a></b><br>A prisoner mentioned in the Gospels, known for being involved in an insurrection and committing murder.
