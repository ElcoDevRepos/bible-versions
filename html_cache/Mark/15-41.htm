Galilee was the region where Jesus conducted much of His early ministry, performing miracles and teaching. The women&#8217;s presence and support indicate their deep commitment and faith. This phrase underscores the idea of discipleship, as following Jesus implies a life of service and dedication. The term "ministered" suggests they provided for His needs, possibly through financial support or by attending to daily necessities, reflecting the model of servanthood that Jesus Himself taught.<p><b>and there were many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him</b><br>This phrase indicates that the group of women was larger than just those named earlier in the chapter. Their journey to Jerusalem with Jesus signifies their loyalty and courage, as traveling such distances was challenging and potentially dangerous. Jerusalem, being the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, was significant for the events of the Passion Week. The presence of these women at such a critical time in Jesus' life highlights their unwavering support. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative where women play crucial roles, such as the women at the tomb who first witnessed the resurrection, emphasizing the theme of faithful witness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_followers.htm">Women Followers</a></b><br>This verse highlights the women who followed Jesus and ministered to Him.
