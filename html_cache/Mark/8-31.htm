The teaching is not just informational but transformational, preparing the disciples for the coming events. This moment is a shift from public ministry to a more intimate instruction for His followers.<p><b>that the Son of Man</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is significant, rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a messianic figure with authority and dominion. Jesus uses this title to emphasize both His humanity and His divine authority. It connects His earthly mission with His heavenly origin and future reign.<p><b>must suffer many things</b><br>The necessity of suffering is central to Jesus' mission. <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> prophesies the suffering servant, and Jesus fulfills this role.

The elders, chief priests, and scribes represent the religious establishment, and their rejection signifies a broader spiritual blindness and resistance to God's plan.<p><b>and that He must be killed</b><br>The necessity of Jesus' death is central to the Christian faith, as it is through His sacrificial death that atonement for sin is made. This aligns with the Passover lamb imagery in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>and after three days rise again</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian belief, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. This prediction aligns with <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a> and foreshadows the empty tomb.

And after three days rise again. St. Matthew and St. Luke say, "on the third day" - the day of his death counting for one, and the day of his resurrection for another, with one clear day intervening. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He began</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#961;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;rxato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_756.htm">Strong's 756: </a> </span><span class="str2">To begin.
