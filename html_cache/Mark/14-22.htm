The institution of this Holy Sacrament took place at the close of the Paschal supper, but while they were yet at the table. The bread which our Lord took would most likely be unleavened bread. But this does not surely constitute a reason why unleavened bread should be used ordinarily in the celebration of the Holy Communion. The direction of the Prayer-book of the English Church is wise and practical, "It shall suffice that the Bread be such as is usual to be eaten." <span class="accented">This is my body</span>; that is, sacramentally. St. Augustine ('Sermo.,' 272) says, "How is the bread his body? and the cup, or that which the cup contains, how is that his blood? These are, therefore, called sacraments, because in them one thing is seen while another thing is understood" (quoted by Dr. Morison, p. 392). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While they were eating,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#952;&#953;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(esthiont&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2068.htm">Strong's 2068: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened for a primary edo; used only in certain tenses, the rest being supplied by phago; to eat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] took</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(lab&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">bread,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(arton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_740.htm">Strong's 740: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bread, a loaf, food.
