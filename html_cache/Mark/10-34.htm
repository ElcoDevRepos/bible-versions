Mocking was a common form of humiliation in ancient times, especially for those claiming kingship or divine status. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men." The mockery highlights the misunderstanding and rejection of Jesus' true identity as the Messiah.<p><b>and spit on Him</b><br>Spitting was a sign of utter contempt and disgrace in Jewish culture, as seen in <a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>. This act of spitting on Jesus further emphasizes the depth of humiliation and rejection He faced. It also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the suffering servant is described as having His face spat upon.<p><b>and flog Him</b><br>Flogging was a brutal Roman punishment often preceding crucifixion. It involved whipping the victim with a flagrum, a whip with multiple thongs, often embedded with bone or metal. This punishment was intended to weaken the victim before crucifixion. The severity of the flogging Jesus endured is a testament to His physical suffering and fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "by His stripes we are healed."<p><b>and kill Him</b><br>This phrase refers to the crucifixion, a method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders in Roman law. Jesus' death was not only a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, but also a pivotal moment in Christian theology, signifying the atonement for humanity's sins. The crucifixion was a public spectacle, intended to serve as a deterrent, yet it became the means of salvation for believers.<p><b>And after three days He will rise again.&#8221;</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. The phrase "after three days" aligns with Jewish understanding of time, where any part of a day is considered a whole day. This event fulfills Jesus' own predictions and Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>.

name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Mark 10:34 Mean</div><b>Who will mock Him</b><p>- Jesus is foretelling the treatment He will receive from both Jewish leaders and Roman authorities. In <a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a> the Lord says, &#8220;He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and they will mock Him,&#8221; underscoring that Jew and Gentile alike share responsibility.<p>- <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7-8</a> anticipates this mockery: &#8220;All who see Me mock Me; they sneer and shake their heads.&#8221; The Messiah knows every detail before it happens, affirming God&#8217;s complete sovereignty.<p>- Mockery exposes the depth of human sin: the Creator stands before His creatures, and they ridicule Him. Yet <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> reminds us, &#8220;While we were still sinners, Christ died for us,&#8221; showing that His love reaches even those who laugh at Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spit on Him</b><p>- Spitting in Scripture represents utter contempt. <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a> prophesies, &#8220;I offered My back to those who beat Me and My cheeks to those who pulled out My beard; I did not hide My face from scorn and spitting.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/mark/14-65.htm">Mark 14:65</a> records the fulfillment: &#8220;Some began to spit on Him,&#8221; proving Jesus&#8217; words true to the letter.<p>- This insult contrasts sharply with His dignity. First Peter 2:23 highlights His response: &#8220;When He suffered, He made no threats.&#8221; Such meekness demonstrates perfect obedience to the Father and models how believers endure persecution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and flog Him</b><p>- Roman flogging was brutal, often leaving victims near death (<a href="/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1</a>). Jesus&#8217; prediction confirms that He willingly submits; nothing catches Him off guard (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> connects the scourging to our redemption: &#8220;By His stripes we are healed.&#8221; Physical wounds bring spiritual healing.<p>- The flogging also satisfies the righteous requirement of the Law, absorbing the penalty we deserved (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and kill Him</b><p>- The climax of human hostility is crucifixion. <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> states He was &#8220;delivered up by God&#8217;s set plan,&#8221; showing divine purpose behind the darkest act.<p>- Jesus calls His death a &#8220;ransom for many&#8221; just a few verses later (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>), interpreting the cross as substitutionary atonement.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> reminds us that &#8220;without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness,&#8221; so His death secures eternal redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and after three days He will rise again</b><p>- The resurrection is the Father&#8217;s vindication of the Son. <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a> declares He was &#8220;appointed the Son of God in power by His resurrection.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a> foreshadows the timeline: &#8220;On the third day He will raise us up,&#8221; aligning perfectly with Jesus&#8217; promise.<p>- Because He lives, believers have living hope (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>) and assurance of their own future resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;after three days&#8221; underscores literal, historical fulfillment. <a href="/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a> records the angel&#8217;s triumphant affirmation: &#8220;He is not here; He has risen, just as He said.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-34.htm">Mark 10:34</a> unfolds a step-by-step prophecy that Jesus fulfills in exact detail. He is mocked, spat upon, flogged, and executed, bearing humanity&#8217;s sin and shame. Yet death cannot hold Him; three days later He rises, proving His identity and securing eternal life for all who trust Him. This verse showcases both the depths of human rebellion and the heights of God&#8217;s redemptive love, inviting us to rest in the finished work of the risen Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Shall spit upon him.</span>--In common with St. Luke, but not with St. Matthew.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[who] will mock</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(empaixousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1702.htm">Strong's 1702: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mock, ridicule.
