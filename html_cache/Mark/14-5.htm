Therefore, three hundred denarii would represent nearly a year's salary, indicating the immense value of the perfume. This highlights the sacrificial nature of the woman's act, as she was willing to give up something of great worth. The mention of the specific amount underscores the disciples' concern for financial stewardship and their practical mindset. This phrase also reflects the economic conditions of the time, where such a sum would have been significant for charitable purposes.<p><b>and the money given to the poor.&#8221;</b><br>The suggestion to give the money to the poor aligns with Jewish teachings and traditions that emphasize almsgiving and care for the needy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>. The disciples' reaction reflects a common expectation of using resources for charitable acts, which was a central aspect of Jewish piety. This concern for the poor is echoed throughout the Gospels, where Jesus often speaks about the importance of helping those in need (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). However, the underlying issue here is the disciples' misunderstanding of the significance of the woman's act of devotion to Jesus.<p><b>And they scolded her.</b><br>The disciples' rebuke of the woman reveals their lack of understanding of the spiritual significance of her actions. This reaction can be seen as a reflection of human tendency to prioritize practical concerns over spiritual insight. The scolding also highlights a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' followers often fail to grasp the deeper meaning of events and teachings. This moment foreshadows the coming events of Jesus' passion, where acts of devotion and sacrifice take on profound significance. The woman's act is a type of Christ's own sacrificial love, as she anoints Him in preparation for His burial, an act that Jesus Himself defends and honors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, whose teachings and actions are the focus of the account.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_alabaster_jar.htm">The Woman with the Alabaster Jar</a></b><br>An unnamed woman who anoints Jesus with expensive perfume, demonstrating her devotion and understanding of His impending death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus, some of whom express indignation at what they perceive as wastefulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The village where this event takes place, located near Jerusalem, often associated with Jesus' friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Represented as a group that the disciples suggest could have benefited from the sale of the perfume.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_worship.htm">Value of Worship</a></b><br>True worship may appear extravagant or wasteful to others, but it is precious in the eyes of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_priorities.htm">Understanding Priorities</a></b><br>While caring for the poor is important, there are moments when honoring Christ takes precedence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_over_actions.htm">Heart Over Actions</a></b><br>God values the intentions of the heart more than the actions themselves.

Like the Magi who opened their treasures before the infant Christ (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>), Mary held nothing back from the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the money given to the poor.</b><p>&#8226; The objection sounds reasonable; caring for the poor is a clear biblical mandate (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself commands generosity toward those in need, yet He also affirms that honoring Him must direct every charitable impulse (<a href="/mark/14-7.htm">Mark 14:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Right actions can spring from wrong motives. John&#8217;s parallel account reveals Judas as the loudest critic, &#8220;not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s act teaches that worship and compassion are not competitors; authentic devotion to Christ fuels authentic mercy toward others (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they scolded her.</b><p>&#8226; The disciples &#8220;indignantly criticized&#8221; Mary (<a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>), mirroring earlier occasions when they rebuked parents bringing children to Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Public censure can hide private pride. The harsh reaction contrasts sharply with Jesus&#8217; later commendation: &#8220;She has done a beautiful thing to Me&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-6.htm">Mark 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Quick judgment often misses the heart. As the Lord told Samuel, &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s silence under criticism resembles her posture in <a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>, sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet and listening. She models quiet, undistracted devotion, leaving her defense to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a> reveals two competing value systems: one measures ministry in monetary terms; the other measures worth by wholehearted love for Jesus. Mary&#8217;s costly perfume signified a year&#8217;s wages joyfully spent in a single act of worship. While provision for the poor remains essential, honoring the Lord must never be sacrificed on the altar of mere practicality. When others scolded, Jesus defended, showing that He treasures devotion springing from a surrendered heart.
