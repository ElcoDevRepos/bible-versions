Jesus often used teaching moments to reveal deeper truths about God's kingdom. His teaching here is not just informative but corrective, addressing the misuse of the temple. This setting in the temple courts highlights His role as a rabbi and a prophet, challenging the religious leaders and the status quo.<p><b>Is it not written:</b><br>Jesus frequently used Scripture to validate His teachings, emphasizing the authority of the Word of God. This rhetorical question points to the established truth found in the Hebrew Scriptures, which His audience would have recognized. It underscores the continuity between Jesus' message and the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8216;My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations&#8217;?</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, which speaks of the temple as a place of worship for all peoples, not just Israel. The temple was intended to be a beacon of God's presence and a place where all nations could seek Him. This reflects God's inclusive plan for salvation and foreshadows the Great Commission, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>But you have made it &#8216;a den of robbers.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus references <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>, where the prophet condemns the people for turning the temple into a place of corruption. The term "den of robbers" suggests a place where thieves hide, implying that the religious leaders were using the temple for personal gain rather than worship. This critique highlights the moral and spiritual decay present in the temple practices of the time. Jesus' actions and words serve as a prophetic judgment against the exploitation and commercialization of sacred spaces, pointing to His role as the purifier of worship and the true High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple and addressing the misuse of the sacred space.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this event, the temple was the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_money_changers_and_merchants.htm">The Money Changers and Merchants</a></b><br>Individuals conducting business in the temple, whom Jesus rebukes for turning a place of worship into a marketplace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">The Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were responsible for maintaining the temple's sanctity but were complicit in its misuse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations (Gentiles)</a></b><br>Jesus references the inclusion of all nations in worship, highlighting the temple's intended purpose as a house of prayer for everyone.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_worship_spaces.htm">The Sanctity of Worship Spaces</a></b><br>Jesus' actions remind us of the importance of maintaining the holiness and purpose of places dedicated to worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_worship.htm">Inclusivity in Worship</a></b><br>God's vision for His house as a place of prayer for all nations challenges us to embrace diversity and inclusivity in our worship communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/condemnation_of_exploitation.htm">Condemnation of Exploitation</a></b><br>The rebuke of the money changers serves as a warning against using religious settings for personal gain or exploitation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger.htm">Righteous Anger</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the corruption in the temple demonstrates that there is a place for righteous anger in confronting injustice and sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection_on_worship.htm">Personal Reflection on Worship</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to examine our own lives and ensure that our worship is genuine and not tainted by ulterior motives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_11_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 11:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_make_our_church_inclusive.htm">How can we ensure our church is a "house of prayer for all nations"?

This dramatic act sets up the teaching that follows.<p>&#8226; Teaching inside the temple courts underscores His authority&#8212;like Ezra reading the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>) or the priests instructing the people (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is not reacting in anger alone; He is intentionally instructing, just as He did on the mount (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-2</a>) and in synagogues (<a href="/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He declared</b><p>&#8226; The wording signals a solemn pronouncement, echoing the prophets who prefaced messages with &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; By speaking publicly, He exposes corruption in broad daylight, fulfilling His role as Messiah who &#8220;will suddenly come to His temple&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His declaration carries the full authority of God&#8217;s Word, reminding listeners that Scripture, not tradition or commerce, sets the standard (<a href="/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is it not written: &#8216;My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations&#8217;?</b><p>&#8226; Jesus quotes <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, affirming the original, unchanging purpose of the temple: a meeting place between God and people.<p>&#8226; &#8220;For all the nations&#8221; widens the scope beyond Israel, previewing the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and Paul&#8217;s teaching that believing Gentiles are now &#8220;fellow citizens&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Prayer, not profit, defines God&#8217;s house. Compare Solomon&#8217;s dedication prayer where foreigners were welcomed to pray toward the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-32.htm">2 Chronicles 6:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference ties worship to righteousness: acceptable sacrifices come from hearts fixed on God (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But you have made it &#8216;a den of robbers.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus now cites <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>, where God rebuked Judah for trusting in ritual while practicing injustice.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Den&#8221; pictures a hideout&#8212;people use worship to mask sin rather than repent of it. Similar hypocrisy appears in <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a> and <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>.<p>&#8226; The specific offense involves exploiting worshipers through inflated currency exchange and animal sales (<a href="/mark/11-15.htm">Mark 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13-16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The rebuke reaches beyond money changers; it confronts any misuse of sacred space or ministry for personal gain (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a> shows Jesus restoring God&#8217;s original design for the temple: a welcoming place where every nation may pray and encounter the Lord. By linking Isaiah&#8217;s promise with Jeremiah&#8217;s warning, He contrasts God&#8217;s heart for inclusive, sincere worship with human tendencies toward greed and hypocrisy. The passage calls believers today to guard the purity of worship, ensure prayer remains central, and open wide the doors of God&#8217;s house to all people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). St. Mark, writing for Gentiles, assures them that the God of the Jews is the God of all the nations; and that the court of the Gentiles, which was then so profaned, was a constituent part of his house of prayer. St. Jerome notes Christ's action in driving out the profaners of the temple as a great proof of his Divine power, that he alone should have been able to cast out so great a multitude. He says, "A fiery splendor flashed from his eyes, and the majesty of Deity shone in his countenance." The words, "My house shall be called the house of prayer," are a quotation from <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>; and it is a remarkable coincidence that in Ver. 11 of that chapter the rulers of the people are described as looking "every one for his gain from his quarter." <span class="cmt_word">A den of thieves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); this should be rendered, <span class="accented">a den of robbers.</span> The Greek word for "thief" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. The two terms are carefully distinguished in St. John (<a href="/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1</a>), "the same is a thief (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) and a robber (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>)." These priests, wholly intent upon gain, by various fraudulent acts plundered strangers and the poor, who came purchase offerings for the worship of God. Observe that the temple is called the house of God, not because he dwells in it in any corporeal sense, for "he dwelleth not in temples made with hands," but because the temple is the place set apart for the worship of God, in which he specially gives ear to the prayers of his people, and in which he specially promises his spiritual presence. Hence we learn what reverence is due to the houses of God; so that, as the master of a house resents any insult offered to his house as an insult to himself, so Christ reckons any wilful dishonor done to his house as a wrong and insult to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He began to teach</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(edidasken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1321.htm">Strong's 1321: </a> </span><span class="str2">To teach, direct, admonish.
