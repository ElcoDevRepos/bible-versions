In the early church, signs and wonders were often seen as validation of the apostles' message (<a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). The use of "signs" suggests a divine endorsement of the gospel message, similar to the miracles performed by Jesus during His ministry (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). The term "accompany" implies that these signs are not the primary focus but rather a confirmation of the believers' faith and the truth of the gospel.<p><b>In My name they will drive out demons;</b><br>Driving out demons is a demonstration of authority over evil spirits, a power that Jesus frequently exercised (<a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>, <a href="/luke/4-41.htm">Luke 4:41</a>). The phrase "In My name" emphasizes the authority of Jesus as the source of this power, reflecting the belief that His name holds divine authority (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). This act of exorcism was a sign of the kingdom of God breaking into the world, as Jesus' ministry was characterized by the defeat of demonic forces (<a href="/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>). The early church continued this practice, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>).<p><b>they will speak in new tongues;</b><br>Speaking in new tongues refers to the miraculous ability to speak in languages previously unknown to the speaker, as first evidenced at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). This gift served as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and the universality of the gospel message, breaking down language barriers and symbolizing the reversal of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The Apostle Paul discusses the use of tongues in the church, emphasizing their role in edification and as a sign for unbelievers (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>).

The promise of the Spirit itself had been prominent, however, throughout our Lord's teaching (<a href="/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>; <a href="/john/14-17.htm" title="Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.">John 14:17</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>), and appears from <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a> to have been specially renewed between the Resurrection and Ascension. On the nature of the gift itself, see Notes on <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.

Such evidences were necessary in the first dawn of Christianity, to attract attention to the doctrine; but our Lord's words do not mean that they were to be in perpetuity, as a continually recurring evidence of the truth of Christianity. St. Gregory (on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>) says, "These signs were necessary in the beginning of Christianity. In order that faith might take root and increase, it must be nourished by miracle; for so even we, when we plant shrubs, only water them until we see that they are taking root, and when we see that they have rooted themselves, we cease to water them. And this is what St. Paul means where he says 'Tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving' (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">In my name shall they cast out devils</span>. St. Mark, of all the evangelists, dwells most perhaps on this, as characteristic of our Lord's work, and as the evidence of his supreme dominion over the spiritual world<span class="cmt_word">. They shall speak with new tongues</span>. This was the first intimation of the great miracle to be inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The gift was continued but for a very limited time. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take up serpents.</span> The instance of St. Paul at Melita (<a href="/acts/28-3.htm">Acts 28:3-5</a>) would be familiar to St. Mark's readers. <span class="cmt_word">And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them</span>. There are some few traditionary notices of the fulfillment of this promise; as in the case of "Justus Barsabas," mentioned by Eusebius ('H.E.,' 3, 19), and of St. John, mentioned by St. Augustine. It may be observed of this passage, that no one could have interpolated it after the cessation of the signs to which it refers, which took place very early. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/16-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">signs</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#275;meia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4592.htm">Strong's 4592: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of a presumed derivative of the base of semaino; an indication, especially ceremonially or supernaturally.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will accompany</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(parakolouth&#275;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5023.htm">Strong's 5023: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it.
