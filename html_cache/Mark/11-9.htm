The people are divided into two groups: those who went ahead and those who followed, indicating a large procession. This event occurs during the Passover festival, a time when Jerusalem's population swells with pilgrims. The act of shouting reflects a common practice in Jewish processions, where participants would vocally express their joy and anticipation. The crowd's actions fulfill the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem, humble and riding on a donkey.<p><b>&#8220;Hosanna!&#8221;</b><br>"Hosanna" is a Hebrew expression meaning "Save now" or "Save, we pray." It is both a plea for salvation and an exclamation of praise. By shouting "Hosanna," the crowd acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, the one who can bring deliverance. This term is used in <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25-26</a>, a psalm associated with the Feast of Tabernacles and often recited during Passover. The use of "Hosanna" here connects Jesus to the messianic expectations of the Jewish people, who longed for a savior to liberate them from Roman oppression.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, a messianic psalm that was part of the Hallel, sung during major Jewish festivals. The crowd's declaration recognizes Jesus as the one sent by God, fulfilling the role of the promised deliverer. In the cultural context, to come "in the name of the Lord" means to come with God's authority and blessing. This acknowledgment by the people highlights their hope that Jesus is the anointed one who will establish God's kingdom. The phrase also foreshadows Jesus' ultimate mission of salvation through His death and resurrection, aligning with the broader narrative of the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, entering Jerusalem as the prophesied Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people who were present during Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, expressing their praise and expectations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosanna.htm">Hosanna</a></b><br>A term of praise and plea for salvation, derived from Hebrew, meaning "Save, please."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_triumphal_entry.htm">The Triumphal Entry</a></b><br>The event where Jesus enters Jerusalem, fulfilling Old Testament prophecy and symbolizing His messianic role.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_jesus_as_messiah.htm">Recognition of Jesus as Messiah</a></b><br>The crowd's acclamation of Jesus as the one who comes in the name of the Lord challenges us to recognize and proclaim Jesus as the Messiah in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_hosanna.htm">Understanding Hosanna</a></b><br>This term is both a cry for help and a shout of praise, reminding us to seek God's salvation while also praising Him for His deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' entry into Jerusalem fulfills specific Old Testament prophecies, reinforcing the reliability of Scripture and God's faithfulness to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_declaration_of_faith.htm">Public Declaration of Faith</a></b><br>The public nature of the crowd's praise encourages believers to openly declare their faith in Jesus, even in the face of opposition or misunderstanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expectations_vs._reality.htm">Expectations vs. Reality</a></b><br>The crowd's expectations of a political savior contrast with Jesus' mission of spiritual salvation, prompting us to align our expectations with God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_11_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 11:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_Blessed_is_He_who_comes.htm">How can we apply "Blessed is He who comes" in our daily lives?
