The presence of the woman in the crowd is significant, as it highlights her desperation and determination to seek healing despite societal norms. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, women often had limited public roles, and her presence in a public space, especially in her condition, would have been unusual and potentially frowned upon.<p><b>who had suffered from bleeding</b><br>The woman's condition is described as a chronic issue of bleeding, likely a menstrual disorder, which would have rendered her ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>). This uncleanness would have isolated her socially and religiously, preventing her from participating in normal community and worship activities. Her suffering was not only physical but also emotional and spiritual due to this isolation.<p><b>for twelve years</b><br>The duration of her suffering emphasizes the chronic nature of her condition and the depth of her desperation. Twelve years is a significant period, suggesting that she had exhausted all available medical and spiritual remedies without success. The number twelve can also be seen as symbolically significant in the Bible, often representing completeness or the people of God (e.g., twelve tribes of Israel, twelve apostles). Her long-term suffering contrasts with the immediate healing she receives from Jesus, highlighting His power and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>This unnamed woman had been suffering from a chronic bleeding condition for twelve years.
