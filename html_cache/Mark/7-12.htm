This tradition effectively nullified the commandment to honor one's father and mother, as found in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>. The Pharisees' interpretation of the law often prioritized ritual over moral obligations, which Jesus criticizes here.<p><b>to do anything</b><br>The phrase underscores the totality of the restriction imposed by the tradition of Corban. It reflects a legalistic approach that prioritizes human traditions over divine commandments. This is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, where He challenges the religious leaders for their focus on external observances rather than the heart of the law, as seen in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-28</a>.<p><b>for his father or mother</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the specific commandment being violated. The cultural context of first-century Judaism placed a high value on family and the responsibility of children to care for their aging parents. By allowing the tradition of Corban to override this duty, the religious leaders were undermining a fundamental aspect of the Mosaic Law. This critique aligns with Jesus' broader mission to fulfill the law by restoring its true intent, as He states in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and scribes, challenging their adherence to human traditions over God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who are known for their strict observance of the law and traditions.

Jesus declares that this tradition directly contradicts God&#8217;s clear command, making the Word &#8220;void.&#8221; The verse warns us to reject any practice&#8212;no matter how religious-sounding&#8212;that excuses disobedience to God&#8217;s plain instruction to love and provide for our parents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">he [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
