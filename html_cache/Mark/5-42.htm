The word "immediately" underscores the power and authority of Jesus over life and death, as seen in other instances such as the healing of the paralytic (<a href="/mark/2-12.htm">Mark 2:12</a>). The girl's ability to "walk around" signifies not just a return to life but a restoration to full health, contrasting with the gradual healings sometimes seen in other biblical accounts. This miracle takes place in the region of Galilee, a setting for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles, emphasizing His ministry's reach and impact. The act of walking also symbolizes new life and resurrection, prefiguring Jesus' own resurrection and the promise of eternal life for believers.<p><b>(she was twelve years old)</b><br>The mention of the girl's age is significant. In Jewish culture, twelve is the age of transition from childhood to adulthood, marking the beginning of a girl's eligibility for marriage and her responsibilities under the Law. This detail may also connect to the woman with the issue of blood, who suffered for twelve years (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25</a>), suggesting a thematic link between the two stories. Both accounts demonstrate Jesus' compassion and power to restore life and purity, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of healing and restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>.<p><b>And at once they were utterly astounded</b><br>The reaction of those present reflects the awe and wonder that often accompany divine encounters. The phrase "utterly astounded" indicates a profound recognition of Jesus' divine authority and the miraculous nature of the event. This response is consistent with other reactions to Jesus' miracles, such as the calming of the storm (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>) and the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51-52</a>).
