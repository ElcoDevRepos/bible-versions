Reclining at the table was customary during this time, symbolizing freedom and relaxation, contrasting with the haste of the original Passover meal in Egypt. This setting underscores the gravity of the moment, as Jesus shares this meal with His closest followers.<p><b>Jesus said</b><br>Jesus often used meals as teaching moments, and His words here are both a revelation and a prophecy. His authority is evident as He speaks, and His foreknowledge of events highlights His divine nature. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the unfolding of His betrayal and crucifixion.<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>The phrase "Truly I tell you" is a solemn affirmation, often used by Jesus to emphasize the importance and truth of His statements. It indicates that what follows is of great significance and should be heeded carefully by the disciples.<p><b>one of you who is eating with Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimacy and trust within the group, as sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and friendship. The betrayal by one who is part of this close circle is particularly poignant and underscores the theme of betrayal by a trusted friend, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>.<p><b>will betray Me</b><br>The act of betrayal is central to the Passion narrative. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, is the one who will betray Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy and setting in motion the events leading to the crucifixion.

The verse invites believers to examine their hearts, trust Christ&#8217;s foreknowledge and sovereignty, and marvel that our Lord willingly walked toward the cross, even when wounded by a friend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">As they sat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as they reclined.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Much had doubtless happened before our Lord said this; but St. Mark only records the important circumstances. These words of our Lord were uttered with great solemnity. The presence of the traitor was a burden upon his spirit, and cast a gloom over this usually joyous festival. A question here arises whether Judas remained to partake of the Holy Communion when our Lord instituted it. The greater number of the Fathers, and amongst them Origen, St. Cyril, St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and Bede, consider that he was present; and Dionysius says that our Lord's words to him, "That thou doest, do quickly," were intended to separate him from the rest of the twelve as one who had partaken unworthily; and that then it was that Satan entered into him, and impelled him onwards to this terrible sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And while</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
