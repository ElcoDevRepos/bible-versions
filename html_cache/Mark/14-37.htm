This moment occurs after the Last Supper, during which Jesus had foretold His betrayal and impending crucifixion. The disciples' inability to stay awake highlights human frailty and the struggle against spiritual lethargy. The garden setting is significant, as Gethsemane means "oil press," symbolizing the intense pressure Jesus faced. This scene parallels the spiritual vigilance required of believers, as emphasized in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which warns to be alert and of sober mind.<p><b>&#8220;Simon, are you asleep?&#8221; He asked.</b><br>Jesus specifically addresses Peter, using his original name, Simon. This personal address may serve as a reminder of Peter's humanity and previous weaknesses, despite his earlier bold declarations of loyalty (<a href="/mark/14-29.htm">Mark 14:29</a>). The use of "Simon" instead of "Peter" (meaning rock) could indicate a moment of testing and failure, reminiscent of Peter's earlier confession of faith in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-18</a>. This question underscores the need for personal accountability and vigilance in spiritual matters.<p><b>&#8220;Were you not able to keep watch for one hour?</b><br>The phrase "one hour" suggests a relatively short period, emphasizing the disciples' inability to remain spiritually alert even for a brief time. This reflects the urgency and importance of prayer and watchfulness, especially in times of trial. The call to "keep watch" is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to be watchful for His return. This moment foreshadows Peter's upcoming denial and serves as a lesson on the necessity of spiritual preparedness and reliance on God's strength rather than human resolve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, experiencing deep anguish as He prepares for His impending crucifixion.

By calling Peter &#8220;Simon,&#8221; the Lord lovingly confronts empty self-confidence, and His question about one hour reminds believers that spiritual vigilance is both attainable and necessary. The verse urges every follower to stay awake&#8212;to live alert, prayerful, and faithful in the moments that matter most.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Simon, sleepest thou?</span>--Note that while St. Matthew and St. Luke give the question in the plural, St. Mark reports it in the singular, and joins it with the emphatic utterance of the name of the disciple. His report, too, includes the two questions which appear separately in the other two Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one</span> hour? St. Luke says (<a href="/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a>) that they were "sleeping for sorrow." So on the Mount of Transfiguration he says (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>) that they were "heavy with sleep." This rebuke, which St. Mark tells us here was pointedly addressed to Peter, seems to glance at his earnest protestations of fidelity made not long before. And our Lord calls him by his old name of Simon. In St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a>) it is less pointed; for there, while our Lord looks at Peter, he addresses them all. "He saith unto <span class="accented">-Peter</span>, <span class="accented">W</span>hat, could not <span class="accented">ye</span> watch with me one hour?" This is just one of those graphic little incidents which we may suppose St. Mark to have received directly from St. Peter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] returned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(heuriskei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
