His teachings were authoritative and often challenged the prevailing religious norms. Jesus frequently used parables, direct teachings, and prophetic insights to convey His message.<p><b>Watch out for the scribes</b><br>The scribes were experts in the Law of Moses and held significant influence in Jewish society. They were responsible for copying, interpreting, and teaching the Scriptures. Jesus warns His followers to be cautious of them, highlighting their potential for hypocrisy and self-righteousness. This warning is consistent with other passages where Jesus criticizes religious leaders for their lack of genuine faith and humility (e.g., <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>).<p><b>They like to walk around in long robes</b><br>The long robes, or "stolai," were garments that signified status and authority. These robes were often worn by those in positions of religious or social prominence. By highlighting their preference for such attire, Jesus points out their desire for public recognition and honor rather than true spiritual devotion. This critique aligns with Jesus' broader message against outward displays of piety without inward transformation.<p><b>to receive greetings in the marketplaces</b><br>Receiving greetings in public spaces like marketplaces was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of one's status. The scribes enjoyed these public accolades, which fed their pride and sense of superiority. Jesus' critique here underscores the danger of seeking human approval over God's approval. This theme is echoed in other teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-6</a>, where He warns against performing religious acts for the sake of being seen by others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts, offering wisdom and warnings to His followers and the crowds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders and scholars of the Law.
