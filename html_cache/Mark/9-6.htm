The disciples' terror is a natural human response to the divine revelation and the overwhelming presence of God's glory. This fear is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter the divine, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and Isaiah's vision of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). The fear underscores the holiness and majesty of God, which often elicits a profound sense of awe and reverence.<p><b>that Peter did not know what else to say.</b><br>Peter's reaction is impulsive, reflecting his character throughout the Gospels. His suggestion to build three shelters (<a href="/mark/9-5.htm">Mark 9:5</a>) indicates a desire to prolong the experience, yet it also reveals a misunderstanding of the event's significance. This moment is not about establishing earthly tabernacles but about recognizing Jesus' divine nature and His fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, represented by Moses and Elijah. Peter's confusion and lack of understanding are echoed in other instances, such as when he rebukes Jesus for predicting His death (<a href="/mark/8-32.htm">Mark 8:32-33</a>). This phrase highlights the disciples' ongoing journey of faith and understanding, which will only be fully realized after the resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong faith.
