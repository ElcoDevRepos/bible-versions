In biblical context, it reflects the idea that God's truth and justice will ultimately prevail. The hidden things can refer to the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, which Jesus often spoke about in parables. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Jesus' ministry, revealing truths that were previously concealed. The concept of hidden things being revealed is also seen in <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>, where God is described as revealing deep and hidden things.<p><b>and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the eventual revelation of all truths, both spiritual and moral. It suggests a future time of judgment when all actions and intentions will be exposed. This is consistent with the teachings found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, where God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing. The imagery of light is significant in Scripture, often symbolizing truth, purity, and the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, where the light shines in the darkness.

The Greek word here for "secret" is interesting as being the same as that which we find in our word "Apocrypha." The term was, in the first instance, applied to books that were surrounded with the secrecy of a spurious sacred-ness, but were not publicly recognised in the Church as being of divine authority, and was then transferred to all books which, whether "spurious" or "secret," wanted that recognition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested</span>.

There is a great principle of the Divine operations here announced by our Lord. Much, very much, is now hidden from us, in nature, in providence, and in grace. But it will not always be hidden. In natural things more and more is revealed as science advances, and in providence and in grace the mysteries of the kingdom will one day, and at the fitting time, be laid open to all.
