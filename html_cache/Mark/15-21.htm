Forced into service by soldiers, Simon models both the weight and the privilege of bearing Christ&#8217;s cross&#8212;an image calling every believer to readiness, obedience, and enduring impact for generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The father of Alexander and Rufus.</span>--The fact recorded here, and not elsewhere, is one of the most striking instances of the independent character of St. Mark's Gospel. It is clear that it had a special interest for himself and the readers for whom he wrote; what that interest was we can only conjecture. The two names were so common that we cannot arrive at more than a probable identification, but the mention of a "Rufus chosen in the Lord" as prominent among the Christians of Rome (<a href="/romans/16-13.htm" title="Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.">Romans 16:13</a>), taken together with the evidence which connects St. Mark's Gospel with that Church (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> tends to the conclusion that he was one of the two brothers thus mentioned. But if so, then we are led on to some other facts of no slight interest. St. Paul speaks of the mother of Rufus as being also his mother--i.e., endeared to him by many proofs of maternal kindness--and so we are led to the belief that the wife of Simon of Cyrene must, at some time or other, at Antioch or Corinth, and afterwards at Rome, have come within the inner circle of St. Paul's friends. This, in its turn, connects itself with the prominence given to "men of Cyrene" in St. Luke's account of the foundation of the Gentile Church of Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>). (See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-20.htm" title="But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.">Matthew 27:20</a>.)<p>(21-38) See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32-51</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they compel one passing by Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go</span> with them, <span class="cmt_word">that he might bear his cross.</span> It seems from St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-32.htm">Matthew 27:32</a>) that our Savior bore his own cross from the palace to the gate of the city. The tablet, with the inscription afterwards attached to the cross, would be carried before him; and a certain number of soldiers would be appointed to go with him to the place of execution, and to see the sentence carried out. Having passed out through the gate of the city, they met one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and they compel him (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">they impress him.</span> The Cyrenians had a synagogue in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>), and this Simon may probably have been one of those who had come up to keep the Passover. He must have been a Hellenistic Jew, a native of Cyrene, on the north coast of Africa. Alexander and Rufus, his sons, were no doubt, at the time when St. Mark wrote his Gospel, well-known disciples of our Lord. St. Paul, writing to the Romans (<a href="/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>), sends a special salutation to Rufus, "chosen in the Lord, and his mother, and mine;" a delicate recognition by St. Paul of something like maternal care bestowed upon him by the mother of Rufus. It is probable that his father Simon, and perhaps his brother Alexander, may have been dead by this time. Rufus is also honorably mentioned by Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians. There is a tradition, mentioned by Cornelius a Lapide, that Rufus became a bishop in Spain, and that Alexander suffered martyrdom. <span class="accented">To go with them</span>, <span class="accented">that he might bear his cross.</span> St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-26.htm">Luke 23:26</a>) adds the touching words, "to bear it after Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Now]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
