Their delight indicates their eagerness to eliminate Jesus, who was seen as a threat to their authority and influence. This reaction fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where the rulers plot against the Lord and His Anointed. The delight also underscores the deep-seated animosity and spiritual blindness of the leaders, who failed to recognize Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>and they promised to give him money</b><br>The promise of money to Judas Iscariot highlights the fulfillment of <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where thirty pieces of silver are mentioned as the price for the shepherd. This transaction reflects the leaders' willingness to use bribery to achieve their ends, a common practice in the corrupt systems of the time. The amount, thirty pieces of silver, was the price of a slave (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>), symbolizing the undervaluation of Jesus' worth by both Judas and the religious leaders.<p><b>So Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus</b><br>Judas Iscariot's decision to betray Jesus marks a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative. His actions are foreshadowed in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend lifts his heel against the psalmist, a type of Christ. Judas's betrayal is not only a personal failure but also part of the divine plan for redemption, as Jesus Himself acknowledges in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>. The phrase indicates Judas's active role in seeking the right moment, reflecting his internal conflict and the influence of Satan, as noted in <a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>.

These pieces of silver were shekels of the sanctuary, worth about three shillings each. This would make the whole amount about &pound;4 10s. of our money; less than half the value of the precious ointment with which Mary had anointed him.
