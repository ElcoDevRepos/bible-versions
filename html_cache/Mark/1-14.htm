John the Baptist's arrest by Herod Antipas (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-18</a>) signifies the end of his public ministry and the beginning of Jesus' ministry. John's role as the forerunner to the Messiah is complete, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>. His arrest also foreshadows the opposition and eventual suffering Jesus will face. The political climate under Herod Antipas was tense, and John's imprisonment highlights the risks associated with proclaiming God's truth.<p><b>Jesus went into Galilee</b><br>Galilee, a region in northern Israel, was a fertile and populous area with a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations. Jesus' choice to begin His ministry here is significant. It fulfills <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee. This area was less influenced by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, allowing Jesus to reach a diverse audience. Galilee's location also made it a strategic place for spreading the gospel, as it was a crossroads for trade and travel.<p><b>and proclaimed the gospel of God</b><br>The term "gospel" means "good news." Jesus' proclamation of the gospel of God marks the inauguration of His public ministry. This message centers on the arrival of God's kingdom, as foretold in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). Jesus' message was one of repentance and faith, calling people to turn from sin and believe in the good news of salvation. This proclamation sets the stage for the rest of Jesus' ministry, where He demonstrates the kingdom through teaching, miracles, and ultimately, His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophetic figure who prepared the way for Jesus by preaching repentance and baptizing in the Jordan River.

Galilee had been specially designated as the scene of the Divine manifestation (see <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>). The land of Galilee, or of Zebulun and Naphtali, had the misfortune to be the first in the sad calamity which fell upon the Jewish nation through the Assyrian invasion; and, in order to console them under this grievious affliction, Isaiah assures them that, by way of recompense, they, above the rest of their brethren, should have the chief share in the presence and ministry of the future promised Messiah. It seems probable that our Lord remained some time in Judaea after his baptism. From thence he went, with Andrew and Peter, two of John's disciples, into Galilee, where he called Philip. And then it was that he turned the water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. This was his first coming out of Judaea into Galilee, related by St. John (<a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, etc.). But the Passover brought him back into Judaea, that he might present himself in the temple; and then occurred his first purging of the temple (<a href="/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>). Then came the visit of Nicedemus to him by night; and then he began openly to preach and to baptize (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>), and thus incurred the envy of the scribes and Pharisees. Therefore he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee; and this is the departure here recorded by St. Mark and by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>). Hence it came to pass that it was in Galilee that Christ called to himself four fishermen - Andrew and Peter, James and John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
