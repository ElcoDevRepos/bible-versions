They were expecting a political or earthly kingdom, not realizing the spiritual and sacrificial nature of Jesus' work. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' followers often misunderstand His teachings and mission (e.g., <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31-33</a>).<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>Jesus' response is direct and authoritative, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. His replies often serve to correct misunderstandings and reveal deeper spiritual truths. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending suffering and death.<p><b>Can you drink the cup I will drink,</b><br>The "cup" is a metaphor for suffering and divine wrath, often used in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jesus is referring to His upcoming crucifixion and the suffering He will endure. This imagery is also seen in the Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus prays about the cup (<a href="/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>).<p><b>or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?</b><br>"Baptism" here symbolizes being overwhelmed or immersed in suffering. This is not a reference to water baptism but rather to the ordeal Jesus will face. The use of "baptism" in this context connects to the idea of being submerged in trials, similar to how water baptism symbolizes being submerged and raised to new life. This phrase foreshadows Jesus' death and resurrection, central to His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a request from James and John, two of His disciples.

He while Salome is represented as the person who makes the request, the answer is given, not to her, but to her sons. <span class="cmt_word">Ye know not what ye ask</span>. Our Lord knew that the sons had spoken in the mother and by the mother. They knew not what they asked <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because his kingdom was spiritual and heavenly, not carnal and earthly, as they supposed; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because they sought the glory before they had gained the victory; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because perhaps they thought that this kingdom was given in right of natural relationship (they were his cousins); whereas it is not given save to those who deserve it and take it by force. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism</span> <span class="cmt_word">that I am baptized with?</span> It is as though he said, "It is by my cross and passion that I am to attain to the kingdom; therefore the same way must be trodden by you who seek the same end." Our Lord here describes his passion as his cup. The "cup" everywhere in Holy Scripture, as well as in profane writers, signifies a man's portion, which is determined for him by God, and sent to him. The figure is derived from the ancient custom at feasts, by which the ruler of the feast tempered the wine according to his own will, and appointed to each guest his own portion, which it was his duty to drink. Our Lord then proceeds to describe his passion, which he had already spoken of as his cup, as his baptism. He uses this image because he would be totally buried, immersed, so to speak, in his passion. But it seems probable that the idea of <span class="accented">purification</span> entered into this image. It was a baptism of fire into which he was plunged, and out of which he came forth victorious. The fire of his bitter passion and death tried him. It was his "salting with fire." It pleased God thus to "make the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings." Our Lord asks these ambitious disciples whether they could drink his cup of suffering, and be baptized with his fiery baptism. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You do not know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(oidate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
