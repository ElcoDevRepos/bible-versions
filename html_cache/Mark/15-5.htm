His amazement likely stemmed from Jesus' calm demeanor and silence in the face of serious accusations. Pilate's reaction highlights the unusual nature of Jesus' response compared to other defendants who would typically plead for their lives. This amazement is significant as it underscores the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which prophesies the Messiah would be silent before His accusers. Pilate's surprise also reflects the Roman perspective on justice, where a defense was expected, making Jesus' silence even more striking.<p><b>Jesus made no further reply</b><br>Jesus' silence can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy and a demonstration of His submission to God's will. <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> describes the suffering servant as being "oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth." This silence is a powerful testament to Jesus' role as the sacrificial Lamb, willingly accepting the path laid out for Him. In the cultural context, silence could be interpreted as a form of protest or a sign of innocence. Jesus' choice not to defend Himself further emphasizes His trust in God's plan and His understanding of His mission to atone for humanity's sins. This moment also connects to <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>, where it is noted that Jesus "did not retaliate" and "made no threats," entrusting Himself to God who judges justly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is on trial before Pilate.

Pilate marvelled at his forbearance, his calmness, his contempt of death; from all of which he argued his absolute innocence and holiness, and resolved to do everything in his power to deliver him.
