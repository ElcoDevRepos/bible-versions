Their departure from the tomb signifies the initial reaction to the angelic announcement of Jesus' resurrection. The act of running away highlights the urgency and intensity of their emotions. In the cultural context of the time, women were not typically considered reliable witnesses, yet the Gospel accounts consistently present them as the first to witness the empty tomb, underscoring the authenticity of the narrative. This moment fulfills Jesus' prophecy of His resurrection and sets the stage for the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>trembling and bewildered</b><br>The emotional response of trembling and bewilderment reflects the awe and fear often associated with divine encounters in Scripture. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter angels or the divine presence, such as Moses at the burning bush or the shepherds at Jesus' birth. The women's fear and confusion also underscore the unexpected nature of the resurrection, despite Jesus' prior predictions. This moment marks a turning point in salvation history, as the resurrection confirms Jesus' victory over death and His divine identity.<p><b>And in their fear they did not say a word to anyone</b><br>The women's initial silence can be understood in light of the overwhelming nature of their experience. Fear, in this context, is not just terror but a profound reverence and awe for the divine mystery they have witnessed. This silence is temporary, as other Gospel accounts indicate that they eventually do share the news with the disciples. The initial silence may also reflect the cultural and societal pressures of the time, where women were not typically the bearers of such significant news. This phrase highlights the human element in the divine narrative, showing the natural human response to the supernatural.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>Refers to Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, who went to the tomb to anoint Jesus' body.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was laid after His crucifixion, which the women found empty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in verse 8, earlier verses describe an angel who informs the women of Jesus' resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_silence.htm">Fear and Silence</a></b><br>The women's reaction to the empty tomb and the angel's message, characterized by trembling, bewilderment, and initial silence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_fear_in_faith.htm">The Reality of Fear in Faith</a></b><br>Even the most faithful can experience fear and confusion.

It has been well remarked that independent accounts of events occurring a time of supreme excitement, and related by trustworthy witnesses, but from different points of view, naturally present difficulties which cannot be cleared up without a full knowledge of all the particulars.
