By taking him aside, Jesus provides a personal and intimate setting for the healing, which reflects His care for individual needs. This also prevents the man from becoming a spectacle, emphasizing the personal nature of Jesus' ministry. In the broader context of the Gospels, Jesus often withdrew from crowds to perform miracles or to pray, highlighting the importance of personal faith and relationship with God over public display (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>).<p><b>and put His fingers into the man&#8217;s ears</b><br>This physical action by Jesus is significant in that it directly addresses the man's ailment. In the cultural context of the time, physical touch was a common method in healing practices, and Jesus uses it here to communicate His intention to heal. The act of touching the ears symbolizes the opening of spiritual and physical hearing, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>). This gesture also prefigures the opening of spiritual understanding that Jesus brings to those who are spiritually deaf.<p><b>Then He spit and touched the man&#8217;s tongue</b><br>Spitting was a common practice in ancient healing rituals, believed to have curative properties. Jesus' use of spit here, combined with the touch of the tongue, signifies the transfer of His divine power to heal. This act can be seen as a symbolic cleansing and restoration of speech, paralleling the spiritual cleansing and renewal that Jesus offers. The use of spit and touch is unique to this miracle, emphasizing the personal and tailored approach Jesus takes in His healing ministry. This action also connects to the creative power of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust, highlighting Jesus' role in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing a miraculous healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deaf_and_mute_man.htm">The Deaf and Mute Man</a></b><br>The individual in need of healing, brought to Jesus by others.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The group of people from whom Jesus takes the man aside, indicating a more personal and intimate interaction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/decapolis.htm">Decapolis</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, known for its Hellenistic influence and mixed population.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_attention_from_jesus.htm">Personal Attention from Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus takes the man aside, showing His care for individual needs.

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/9-29.htm" title="Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.">Matthew 9:29</a>.) Here the man could not find in the pitying tones of the voice of the Healer that on which his faith could fasten, and the act came in to fill up the void.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took him aside from the multitude privately</span>.

It was as though he said, "I am about to open a passage for hearing through these ears." <span class="cmt_word">And he spat, and touched his tongue;</span> that is, he touched his tongue with saliva from his own sacred lips. These symbolical actions must have had a great meaning for the afflicted man. They were a <span class="accented">tableau vivant</span>, an acted metaphor, teaching him what he might expect from the mercy of Christ. The analogy of the miracle recorded in St. John (<a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>) should be noticed here. It is an interesting circumstance (noticed in the 'Speaker's Commentary') that, in the Latin Church, the officiating priest touches the nostrils and ears of those who are to be baptized, with saliva from his own mouth. We may be assured that, in the case before us, these signs used by our Lord were intended to awaken the afflicted man's faith, and to stir up in him the lively expectation of a blessing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] took him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apolabomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_618.htm">Strong's 618: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and lambano; to receive; also to take aside.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">aside</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(kat&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">privately,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(idian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pertaining to self, i.e. One's own; by implication, private or separate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">away from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(apo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
