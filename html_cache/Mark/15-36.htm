It was a diluted vinegar wine, often used to quench thirst. The act of offering sour wine to Jesus fulfills <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, which prophesies, "They gave me vinegar for my thirst." This gesture, while seemingly compassionate, also highlights the mockery and humiliation Jesus faced, as sour wine was not a drink of honor.<p><b>He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink,</b><br>The use of a reed, likely a hyssop stalk, is significant. Hyssop was used in the Old Testament for purification rituals (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-6</a>), symbolizing cleansing and sacrifice. This act can be seen as a type of Christ's role as the ultimate sacrificial lamb, purifying humanity from sin. The physical act of lifting the sponge to Jesus on the cross underscores His physical suffering and the fulfillment of His mission.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' cry, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" (<a href="/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>), which some bystanders mistook as a call for Elijah. In Jewish tradition, Elijah was expected to return before the Messiah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>). The crowd's expectation of Elijah's appearance reveals their lack of understanding of Jesus' true identity and mission. This moment underscores the theme of spiritual blindness and the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus' death was necessary for the salvation of humanity, not a rescue by Elijah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being crucified at this moment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bystander.htm">The Bystander</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who offers Jesus sour wine on a sponge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet from the Old Testament, whom some Jews believed would return to help the Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of the crucifixion, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Those present at the crucifixion, including Roman soldiers, Jewish leaders, and onlookers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The offering of sour wine fulfills Old Testament prophecy, demonstrating the divine orchestration of events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misunderstanding_of_jesus'_mission.htm">Misunderstanding of Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>The crowd's expectation of Elijah's return shows a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/suffering_and_mockery.htm">Suffering and Mockery</a></b><br>Jesus' endurance of suffering and mockery serves as an example of humility and obedience to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_bystanders.htm">The Role of Bystanders</a></b><br>The actions of the bystander reflect the varied responses to Jesus' crucifixion, from mockery to misguided attempts at compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_thirst.htm">Spiritual Thirst</a></b><br>Jesus' physical thirst on the cross symbolizes the deeper spiritual thirst of humanity, which He came to quench.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_15_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_36_Jesus_fulfills_prophecy.htm">How does Mark 15:36 demonstrate Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_wine_vinegar_in_Mark_15_36.htm">What significance does the offered "sponge of wine vinegar" hold in Mark 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_compassion_in_Mark_15_36.htm">How can we show compassion to others, as seen in Mark 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_36_Respond_to_suffering_today.htm">What does Mark 15:36 teach about responding to others' suffering today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_36_and_Psalm_69_21_link.htm">How does Mark 15:36 connect to Psalm 69:21's prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_give_Jesus_vinegar_in_Mark_15_36.htm">Why was Jesus offered vinegar to drink in Mark 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_sponge_important_in_Mark_15_36.htm">What is the significance of the sponge in Mark 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_36_and_Old_Testament_prophecy.htm">How does Mark 15:36 fulfill Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_mark_15_align_with_other_gospels.htm">How do the events described in Mark 15 align with differing crucifixion accounts in the other Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_miracles_exist_if_they_defy_nature.htm">How can miracles be real if they defy natural laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_christian_socialism.htm">Are you overly sensitive?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_psalm_69_originally_about_jesus.htm">Psalm 69 is frequently seen as messianic&#8212;what evidence exists that the text was originally about Jesus rather than solely about the psalmist&#8217;s circumstances?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Mark 15:36 Mean</div><b>And someone ran</b><p>&#8226;

Even the small details prove God&#8217;s Word reliable and Christ&#8217;s mission complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - There is a slight difference here in the narratives. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-49.htm">Matthew 27:49</a>) says, "And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him." Here in St. Mark the words are recorded as having been spoken by him alone who offered our Lord the vinegar. According to St. John (John 21:28), the offering of the vinegar followed immediately upon the words of our Lord, "<span class="accented">I</span> thirst." This drink was not the stupefying potion given to criminals before their crucifixion, to lull the sense of pain, but the sour wine, the ordinary drink of the soldiers, called <span class="accented">posen.</span> The reed was most probably the long stalk of the hyssop plant. Dr. J. Forbes Royle, in an elaborate article on the subject, quoted in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' (vol. 1 p. 846), arrives at the conclusion that the hyssop is none other than the caper plant, the Arabic name of which, <span class="accented">asuf</span>, bears a strong resemblance to the Hebrew. The plant is the <span class="accented">Capparis spinosa</span> of Linnaeus. The apparent difference between the narratives of St. Matthew and St. Mark may be reconciled by weaving in the narrative of St. John with those of the synoptists - the "Let be" of the soldiers in the one case being intended to restrain the individual from offering the wine; and the "Let be" of the individual, corresponding to our "Wait a moment," while he answered our Savior's cry, "I thirst." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">someone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
