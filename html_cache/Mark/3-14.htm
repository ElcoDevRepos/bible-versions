This appointment marks a foundational moment in the establishment of the Church. The selection of twelve men reflects Jesus' intention to create a new covenant community, echoing the twelve patriarchs of Israel. This act also fulfills the role of Jesus as a leader who is reconstituting Israel around Himself.<p><b>whom He designated as apostles</b><br>The term "apostles" means "sent ones" and signifies those who are chosen and commissioned by Jesus to carry out His mission. This designation sets them apart with a specific authority and responsibility. The apostles are given a unique role in the early Church, serving as eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and as foundational leaders in spreading the Gospel. This role is further emphasized in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus tells them they will be His witnesses to the ends of the earth.<p><b>to accompany Him</b><br>The apostles are called to be in close relationship with Jesus, learning from His teachings and observing His actions. This companionship is crucial for their spiritual formation and preparation for future ministry. Being with Jesus allows them to understand His mission and message deeply, equipping them to represent Him accurately. This aspect of discipleship highlights the importance of personal relationship with Christ as the basis for effective ministry.<p><b>to be sent out to preach</b><br>The mission of the apostles involves active participation in spreading the Gospel. Preaching is central to their commission, as it is through the proclamation of the Word that people come to faith (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-15</a>). This sending out reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations. The apostles' preaching is empowered by the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where Peter's sermon leads to the conversion of thousands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who appoints the twelve apostles.

Their actual consecration (of all of them at least but one, namely, Judas Iscariot) took place when he breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>). But from this time they were his apostles "designate." They were henceforth to Be with him as his attendants and disciples. They were to go forth and preach under his direction, and by his power they were to cast out devils. Several manuscripts add here that they were "to heal sicknesses," but the words are emitted in some of the oldest authorities. The authority over unclean spirits is more formally conveyed later on (see <a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), so that here St. Mark speaks by anticipation. But this shows how much importance was attached to this part of their mission; for it recognizes the spiritual world, and the special purpose of the manifestation of the Son of God, namely, that he might "destroy the works of the devil." <span class="accented">He appointed twelve.</span> The number twelve symbolizes perfection and universality. The number three indicates what is Divine; and the number four, created things. Three multiplied by four gives twelve, the number of those who were to go forth as apostles into the four quarters of the world - called to the faith of the holy Trinity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He appointed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
