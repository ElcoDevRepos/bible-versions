He ruled during the time of Jesus' ministry. The "this" refers to the reports about Jesus' miraculous works and growing popularity. Herod's court would have been abuzz with news of Jesus, as His ministry was causing a significant stir in the region. Herod's interest in Jesus is consistent with his political and personal intrigue, as he was known for his curiosity about religious matters and his superstitious nature.<p><b>he said, &#8220;John, whom I beheaded</b><br>Herod had previously ordered the beheading of John the Baptist, as recorded in <a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-29</a>. This act was a result of a complex interplay of political maneuvering and personal vendetta, primarily influenced by Herodias, Herod's unlawful wife. John had publicly condemned Herod's marriage to Herodias, who was previously married to Herod's brother Philip, as unlawful according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16, 20</a>:21). Herod's acknowledgment of John's beheading indicates his awareness of the gravity of his actions and possibly a guilty conscience.<p><b>has risen from the dead!&#8221;</b><br>Herod's statement reflects the common Jewish belief in resurrection, which was a significant theme in Jewish eschatology. This belief is evident in other parts of the New Testament, such as in the Pharisees' doctrine (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>). Herod's fear that John had risen suggests his superstitious nature and possibly a fear of divine retribution. This mirrors the broader theme of resurrection in the New Testament, ultimately pointing to Jesus' own resurrection, which is central to Christian faith. Herod's reaction also highlights the confusion and misunderstanding about Jesus' identity, a recurring theme in the Gospels, where people often mistake Jesus for a prophet or a resurrected figure from the past.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, son of Herod the Great.

The moment news of miraculous power arrived, Herod&#8217;s attention snapped to it. This is the same pattern we see in <a href="/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7&#8211;9</a>, where political power finds itself rattled by spiritual authority. Herod&#8217;s curiosity is mixed with dread, reminding us that even earthly rulers are accountable to higher truth (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said</b><p>Herod moves straight to speech, revealing what fills his heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). His gut reaction exposes an inner dialogue of fear and guilt. Like Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16&#8211;17</a>, he recognizes his wrongdoing but searches for relief without true repentance. Notice that Herod does not call advisors first; conscience speaks faster than politics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"John, whom I beheaded</b><p>Herod names John the Baptist and admits the brutal fact: &#8220;whom I beheaded.&#8221; Scripture already narrated the grisly details (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17&#8211;29</a>), showing Herod&#8217;s weak capitulation to Herodias&#8217; demand. Now the unresolved sin resurfaces. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> declares, &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues,&#8221; and here the pursuer is memory itself. This clause also affirms historical reality: John truly died by Herod&#8217;s order, a fact echoed in <a href="/luke/3-19.htm">Luke 3:19&#8211;20</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has risen from the dead!</b><p>Herod jumps to resurrection, a concept firmly embedded in Old Testament hope (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>). He fears divine vindication: the prophet he silenced is alive, and judgment may follow. <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm">Matthew 14:2</a> records the same conclusion, underscoring that Herod&#8217;s reaction was immediate and consistent. Ironically, Herod&#8217;s terror foreshadows the later, literal resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/mark/16-6.htm">Mark 16:6</a>), which Herod would again fail to grasp (<a href="/luke/23-8.htm">Luke 23:8&#8211;11</a>). The verse also highlights how unmistakable Jesus&#8217; miracles were; even skeptics reached supernatural explanations rather than dismiss them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-16.htm">Mark 6:16</a> exposes a guilty ruler confronted by the unstoppable advance of God&#8217;s kingdom. Herod&#8217;s conscience, pricked by news of Jesus&#8217; power, leaps to the only explanation that fits his fears: John the Baptist is alive again. The verse illustrates how unrepented sin breeds torment, how God&#8217;s works demand acknowledgment, and how even the mighty must reckon with resurrection reality.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Herod</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;&#961;&#8180;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;r&#333;d&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2264.htm">Strong's 2264: </a> </span><span class="str2">Compound of heros and eidos; heroic; Herod, the name of four Jewish kings.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
