The six-day period may echo the six days of creation, suggesting a new revelation or creation is about to occur. It also parallels the six days Moses waited on Mount Sinai before God spoke to him (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>).<p><b>Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John</b><br>These three disciples form Jesus' inner circle, often present at significant moments (e.g., the raising of Jairus' daughter in <a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a> and Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane in <a href="/mark/14-33.htm">Mark 14:33</a>). Their selection underscores their future leadership roles in the early Church. Peter, James, and John are also symbolic of the Law, Prophets, and Writings, representing the fullness of the Old Testament witness to Jesus.<p><b>and led them up a high mountain by themselves</b><br>Mountains in biblical narratives are often places of divine revelation and encounter with God, such as Mount Sinai for Moses and Mount Carmel for Elijah. The specific mountain is not named, but tradition often identifies it as Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon. The solitude emphasizes the personal and profound nature of the revelation about to occur.<p><b>There He was transfigured before them</b><br>The transfiguration is a pivotal moment revealing Jesus' divine nature. The Greek word for "transfigured" is "metamorphoo," indicating a transformation that reveals His glory. This event fulfills the promise of seeing the kingdom of God come with power (<a href="/mark/9.htm">Mark 9:1</a>) and prefigures the resurrection. It also connects to Old Testament theophanies, where God's glory is revealed, such as in <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a> when Moses' face shone after speaking with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to reveal His divine glory to His closest disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples chosen by Jesus to witness the Transfiguration.

St. <a href="/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a> says, "About eight days after these sayings." There is no real discrepancy here. There were six whole days that intervened between our Lord's words and the Transfiguration itself. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John</span>. He chose these three, as the leaders amongst the disciples, and he showed to them his glory, because he intended also to show them afterwards his bitter agony in the garden. This magnificent splendor - this "excellent glory," as <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a> describes it - this, together with the voice of the Father," This is my beloved Son," would assure them that Christ was truly God, but that his essential Deity was hidden by the veil of the flesh; and that, although he was about to be crucified and slain, yet his Godhead could not suffer or die. It was an evidence beforehand, a prospective evidence, that he underwent death, even the death of the cross, not constrained by infirmity or necessity, but of his own will, for the redemption of man. It was plain that, since he could thus invest his body with this Divine glory, he could have saved himself from death if he had so willed. <span class="accented">He taketh with him Peter</span>, <span class="accented">and James</span>, <span class="accented">and John.</span> St. Peter's reference to the transfiguration (just alluded to) shows what a deep and abiding impression it made on his mind. St. James, too, was there, as one who was to be amongst the first to die for his sake. St. John also was with them, who, having seen the glory of the Son of God, which is subject to no limits of time, might be bold to send forth his grand testimony, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." And bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves. "It is necessary for all," says Remigius, "who desire to contemplate God, that they should not grovel amidst low thoughts and desires, but ever be lifted up to heavenly things. And thus our Lord was teaching his disciples that they must not look for the brightness of the Divine glory in the depths of this world, but in the kingdom of heavenly blessedness. And he leads them apart, because holy men are in intention and desire separated from evil, as they will be altogether separated from it in the world to come. For they who look for the glories of the resurrection ought now in heart and mind to dwell on high, and to seek these glories by continual prayer." <span class="accented">Into a high mountain.</span> A tradition of the time of Jerome identifies this mountain with Tabor, in Galilee. But there are two weighty objections to this view: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that our Lord was at this time in the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, a considerable distance from Tabor, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is strong reason for believing that Tabor had at this time a fortress on its summit. It must be remembered that Caesarea Philippi was at the foot of Libanus; and the spurs of Libanus would present several eminences answering to the description, "a high mountain (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Mount of Transfiguration was in all probability Hermon, a position of extreme grandeur and beauty, its snowy peaks overlooking the whole extent of Palestine. "High up," says Dean Stanley, "on its southern slopes there must be many a point where the disciples could be taken 'apart by themselves.' Even the transient comparison of the celestial splendor with the snow, where alone it could be seen in Palestine, should not, perhaps, be wholly overlooked. At any rate, the remote heights above the sources of the Jordan witnessed the moment when, his work in his own peculiar sphere being ended, he set his face for the last time to go up to Jerusalem." Although compelled to dismiss from our minds the old tradition of Tabor as the scene of the Transfiguration, we still think of that mountain as near to Nazareth, where our Lord was brought up; and of Hermon, where he was transfigured, as we rejoice in the fulfillment of the old prophecy, "Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name." And he was transfigured (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) before them. The fashion of his appearance was changed. It was no illusion, no imaginary appearance, but a real transformation. It was the Divine glory within him manifesting itself through his humanity; and yet not that glory of Deity which no man hath seen or can see; but such a manifestation that the disciples might in some degree behold the glory and majesty, of Deity through the veil of his flesh. Nor, we may believe, did our Lord in his transfiguration change the essence or form of his countenance. But he assumed a mighty splendor, so that, as St. <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a> tells us, "his face did shine as the sun." This splendor was not in the air, nor in the eyes of the disciples, but in the person of the Son of God - a splendor which communicated itself to his raiment, so <span class="cmt_word">that his garments became glistering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">exceeding white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them</span>. This figure is taken from natural things. The first idea of "fuller" from the Latin <span class="accented">fullo</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> that of one who cleanses by "stamping with the feet." His business is to restore the soiled cloth to its natural whiteness. The evangelist uses an earthly thing to represent the heavenly. The heavenly Fuller gives a purity and a brightness infinitely exceeding the power of any "fuller on earth." It would almost seem as if the figure was one specially supplied by St. Peter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">six</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7955;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(hex)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1803.htm">Strong's 1803: </a> </span><span class="str2">Six.
