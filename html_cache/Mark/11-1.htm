Jerusalem is the central city of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, making it a focal point for religious and political activity. Jesus' approach to Jerusalem signifies the fulfillment of His mission and the culmination of His earthly ministry. This journey is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem.<p><b>and came to Bethphage and Bethany</b><br>Bethphage and Bethany are two small villages located near Jerusalem. Bethphage, meaning "house of unripe figs," is less mentioned in the Bible but is significant as the starting point of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. Bethany, meaning "house of affliction," is more frequently mentioned and is known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. It is also the place where Jesus performed the miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11), which heightened His popularity and the anticipation of His arrival in Jerusalem.<p><b>at the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives is a ridge east of Jerusalem, significant in both Jewish and Christian traditions. It is a place of prophecy and eschatological importance, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, which predicts the Lord's feet standing on the Mount of Olives. This location is also where Jesus would later ascend into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>). The Mount of Olives offers a panoramic view of Jerusalem, symbolizing Jesus' impending entry into the city and His ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>Jesus sent out two of His disciples</b><br>This action demonstrates Jesus' authority and foreknowledge. By sending two disciples, Jesus is preparing for His entry into Jerusalem, ensuring that all details align with prophetic fulfillment. The sending of the disciples also reflects a pattern in Jesus' ministry of involving His followers in His work, teaching them obedience and trust. This act is reminiscent of the instructions given to the disciples in other parts of the Gospels, emphasizing the importance of following Jesus' commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, preparing for His triumphal entry into Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Two unnamed disciples are sent by Jesus to carry out a specific task.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, significant in Jewish history and prophecy, where Jesus is heading.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethphage.htm">Bethphage</a></b><br>A small village near Jerusalem, its name means "house of unripe figs."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>Another village near Jerusalem, known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A ridge east of Jerusalem, significant in biblical prophecy and Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>Jesus' instructions to His disciples demonstrate the importance of obedience, even when the task seems unusual or unclear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>The location and actions in this passage are deeply rooted in prophecy, reminding us of God's sovereign plan and the reliability of His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_worship.htm">Preparation for Worship</a></b><br>As Jesus approaches Jerusalem, He is preparing for a significant act of worship and sacrifice.

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>) says, "When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage." St. Mark mentions the three places together, because Bethphage and Bethany, being near together, were also both of them close to Jerusalem. The distance from Jericho to Jerusalem (about seventeen miles) would involve a journey of about seven hours. The country between Jerusalem and Jericho is hilly, rugged, and desolate. It is from the height overhanging Bethany that the finest view of Jerusalem is gained. It appears from St. John (<a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>) that our Lord on the preceding sabbath had supped, and probably passed the night, at Bethany; and that on the following day (answering to our Palm Sunday) he had come still nearer to Jerusalem, namely, to Bethphage; and from thence he sent two of his disciples for the ass and the colt. So his way to Jerusalem was from Bethany by Bethphage, the Mount of Olives, and the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Valley of Jehoshaphat, through which flows the brook Kedron, lies close to Jerusalem. Bethphage literally means "the house of green figs," as Bethany, lying a short distance west of it, means "the house of dates." The date palm growing in the neighbeurhood would furnish the branches with which the multitude strewed the way on the occasion of our Lord's triumphal entry. <span class="cmt_word">He sendeth two of his disciples</span>. Who were they? Bede thinks that they were Peter and Philip. Jansonius, with greater probability, thinks that they were Peter and John, because a little after this Christ sent these two to prepare for the Passover. But we know nothing certain on this point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
