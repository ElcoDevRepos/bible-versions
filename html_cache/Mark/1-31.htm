In the cultural context of the time, a rabbi or teacher might not typically enter the private quarters of a woman, especially one who was ill, due to purity laws. Jesus' action demonstrates His compassion and breaks social norms, emphasizing His mission to reach all people. This act of going to her also reflects the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, as He often sought out individuals to heal and teach.<p><b>took her by the hand</b><br>Taking someone by the hand was a gesture of compassion and personal connection. In the Jewish culture of the time, physical touch could render someone ceremonially unclean, especially if the person was sick. However, Jesus' touch brings healing rather than impurity, showcasing His authority over illness and His role as the ultimate healer. This act prefigures the many instances where Jesus' touch brings restoration, such as in the healing of Jairus' daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>).<p><b>and helped her up</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' active role in the healing process. It is not just His presence or touch, but His direct intervention that brings about healing. The act of helping her up symbolizes restoration and new life, akin to resurrection. This mirrors the spiritual resurrection Jesus offers to all who believe in Him, as seen in His promise of eternal life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><b>The fever left her</b><br>The immediate departure of the fever signifies the completeness and authority of Jesus' healing power. In the ancient world, fevers were often seen as serious and life-threatening, with limited medical remedies available. The instantaneous healing underscores Jesus' divine authority over physical ailments, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our sicknesses.<p><b>and she began to serve them</b><br>Her response to serve immediately after being healed reflects gratitude and restoration to her role within the household. In the cultural context, hospitality was a significant aspect of Jewish life, and her service indicates a return to normalcy and community. This act of service can be seen as a model for believers, illustrating that healing and salvation should lead to a life of service to others, as echoed in Jesus' teaching on servanthood (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion by healing Simon's mother-in-law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon's_mother-in-law.htm">Simon's Mother-in-law</a></b><br>The woman who was healed by Jesus.
