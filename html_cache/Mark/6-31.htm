It highlights His role as a teacher and leader, guiding His followers. In the context of <a href="/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>, Jesus had just sent the disciples out on a mission (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7-13</a>) and they returned to report their experiences. This moment underscores the importance of Jesus' personal relationship with His disciples, emphasizing His care and concern for their well-being.<p><b>Come with Me privately</b><br>Jesus invites His disciples to withdraw from the crowds. This reflects the need for intimacy and personal time with Jesus, away from the demands of ministry. It also suggests the importance of spiritual retreat and reflection. In the Gospels, Jesus often sought solitude for prayer and communion with the Father (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>), setting an example for His followers.<p><b>to a solitary place</b><br>The call to a solitary place indicates a physical and spiritual retreat. Geographically, this could refer to the remote areas around the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus often ministered. Solitude is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God meets individuals in quiet places (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>). It emphasizes the need for rest and renewal in God's presence.<p><b>and let us rest for a while</b><br>Rest is a biblical principle established from creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Jesus acknowledges the disciples' need for physical and spiritual rest after their ministry work. This rest is not just physical but also a time for spiritual rejuvenation. It reflects the Sabbath principle and points to Jesus as the ultimate rest for believers (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>For many people were coming and going</b><br>This phrase describes the constant demands on Jesus and His disciples. The crowds were drawn to Jesus' teaching and miracles, creating a hectic environment. It highlights the popularity of Jesus' ministry and the relentless nature of His work. This context shows the necessity of intentional withdrawal to maintain spiritual health.<p><b>and they did not even have time to eat</b><br>The disciples' lack of time to eat underscores the intensity of their ministry efforts. It reflects the sacrificial nature of following Jesus, where personal needs are often secondary to the mission. This situation also illustrates the human limitations of the disciples, emphasizing their dependence on Jesus for sustenance and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who invites His disciples to rest.

He is the Shepherd who observes the condition of His flock and speaks into their need (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). The disciples have just returned from preaching and healing (<a href="/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30</a>); their excitement is met by His loving guidance, reminding us that ministry is always directed by the Master&#8217;s voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come with Me</b><p>The invitation is first to companionship, not activity. Jesus does not merely say &#8220;Go,&#8221; but &#8220;Come.&#8221; Being with Him precedes doing for Him (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13</a>; <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).

Solitude is not escape from responsibility; it is preparation for faithful service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And let us rest for a while</b><p>Rest is God-given, not self-indulgent. The Lord who never slumbers (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>) still prescribes rest for His followers (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).
