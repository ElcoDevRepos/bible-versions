It highlights the ongoing need for compassion and charity within society. In the historical context of first-century Judea, poverty was widespread, and Jesus' followers would have been familiar with the social and economic challenges of the time. This statement underscores the importance of continual care for the needy, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>.<p><b>and you can help them whenever you want</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the opportunity and responsibility to assist the poor. It suggests that acts of charity should be a regular and voluntary part of a believer's life. The phrase implies that while the opportunity to help the poor is constant, it requires intentional action. This aligns with the teachings in <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a>, which stress the importance of faith being accompanied by deeds. The cultural context of the time would have included almsgiving as a common practice, seen as a righteous act in Jewish tradition.<p><b>But you will not always have Me</b><br>Here, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about the limited time they have with Him before His crucifixion. This statement highlights the unique and irreplaceable presence of Jesus during His earthly ministry. It points to the urgency of recognizing and valuing His presence and teachings. Theologically, this phrase foreshadows His impending death and resurrection, a pivotal event in Christian doctrine. It also connects to the idea of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, and the temporary nature of His physical presence, which would later be succeeded by the Holy Spirit as described in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples and others present, emphasizing the importance of His presence and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, specifically in the house of Simon the leper.
