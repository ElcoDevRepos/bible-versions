They were known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and the oral traditions that had developed around it. Their question to Jesus reflects their role as religious authorities who were concerned with maintaining the purity of Jewish law. The Pharisees often confronted Jesus, as seen in other passages like <a href="/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a> and <a href="/luke/6-2.htm">Luke 6:2</a>, where they challenge His actions and teachings. This interaction highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Look, why are they doing</b><br>The Pharisees' question is accusatory, drawing attention to the actions of Jesus' disciples. This reflects their focus on external observance of the law rather than the heart or intent behind actions. The use of "Look" indicates their intent to publicly challenge Jesus and His followers, suggesting a desire to discredit Him. This moment is part of a series of confrontations that illustrate the differing interpretations of the law between Jesus and the Pharisees.<p><b>what is unlawful on the Sabbath?&#8221;</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest instituted by God in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). By the time of Jesus, numerous additional rules had been added to define what constituted "work" on the Sabbath. The disciples were picking grain, which the Pharisees considered reaping, a form of work prohibited on the Sabbath. This reflects the broader debate about the purpose of the Sabbath, which Jesus addresses in <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>, emphasizing that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit. The Pharisees' interpretation of the law is contrasted with Jesus' teaching, which focuses on mercy and the spirit of the law, as seen in <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>. This incident foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of the law in Christ, who is Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Matthew&#8217;s parallel records, &#8220;When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a>), underscoring a pattern: whenever Jesus&#8217; ministry collides with their traditions, they speak up. Their focus is on defending man-made boundaries rather than celebrating the Messiah who stands before them (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look,</b><p>This single word is a finger-point.<p>&#8226; It signals moral outrage&#8212;&#8220;Observe this breach!&#8221;<p>&#8226; It drags the crowd&#8217;s attention toward an imaginary scandal.<p>Luke&#8217;s account echoes the tone: &#8220;Some of the Pharisees said, &#8216;Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-2.htm">Luke 6:2</a>). The spotlight is deliberately aimed at Jesus, the Teacher responsible for His disciples.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why are they doing</b><p>The action in question comes from the previous verse: &#8220;His disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they walked&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-23.htm">Mark 2:23</a>). Scripture actually permits this simple gleaning: &#8220;When you enter your neighbor&#8217;s grainfield, you may pluck the heads with your hand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>).<p>&#8226; No theft occurred.<p>&#8226; Hunger, not profit, motivated them.<p>What bothers the Pharisees is not the picking but the timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what is unlawful</b><p>God&#8217;s Law never forbade the act; the accusation rests on Pharisaic tradition that multiplied Sabbath regulations (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>). By their reckoning, rubbing grain equaled threshing&#8212;a category of labor they had fenced off. Jesus will expose this human overlay when He cites David eating consecrated bread (<a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>) and declares, &#8220;I desire mercy, not sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the Sabbath?</b><p>The Sabbath is God&#8217;s gracious gift of rest (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Yet legalism had turned it into a burden. Jesus later affirms, &#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Mercy outweighs ritual (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Human need outranks ceremonial scruples (<a href="/matthew/12-11.htm">Matthew 12:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The day ultimately points to the rest found in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/2-24.htm">Mark 2:24</a> captures a clash between rigid religion and living truth. The Pharisees, trusting their fence of rules, accuse Jesus&#8217; disciples of Sabbath-breaking. Jesus will reveal that their traditions, not God&#8217;s Word, have been violated. The verse challenges us to guard against elevating human regulations above Scripture and to remember that God&#8217;s commands, rightly understood, serve compassion, freedom, and life in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which is not lawful</span>.
