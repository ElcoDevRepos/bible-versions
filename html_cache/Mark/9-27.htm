In the context of <a href="/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>, Jesus has just performed an exorcism on a boy possessed by a spirit. The act of taking someone by the hand is a gesture of care and authority, often seen in other healing accounts (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-31.htm">Mark 1:31</a>, where Jesus heals Peter's mother-in-law). This physical touch signifies Jesus' willingness to engage personally with those He heals, breaking cultural norms that often avoided physical contact with the sick or demon-possessed.<p><b>and helped him to his feet</b><br>This action demonstrates Jesus' power to restore and renew. The boy, previously incapacitated by the spirit, is now able to stand, symbolizing a return to life and normalcy. This act can be seen as a type of resurrection, prefiguring Jesus' own resurrection and the ultimate restoration He offers to humanity. It also reflects the biblical theme of God lifting up the downtrodden, as seen in Psalms and the prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/psalms/145-14.htm">Psalm 145:14</a>).<p><b>and he stood up</b><br>The boy's ability to stand is a testament to the completeness of Jesus' healing. In biblical terms, standing often represents strength, readiness, and the ability to serve (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>, where believers are called to stand firm in spiritual battle). This moment signifies not only physical healing but also spiritual liberation and empowerment. The boy's standing is a visual confirmation of the miracle, reinforcing the authority of Jesus over evil and His role as the Messiah who brings freedom and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who performs a miracle by healing a boy possessed by an unclean spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boy.htm">The Boy</a></b><br>A young boy who was possessed by a spirit that caused him to be mute and have seizures.
