The context is significant as Jesus had just descended from the Mount of Transfiguration, where He was revealed in His divine glory to Peter, James, and John. The people&#8217;s reaction suggests that Jesus' presence was both anticipated and revered. This reflects the growing reputation of Jesus as a miracle worker and teacher, drawing large crowds wherever He went. The anticipation of the Messiah was high during this period, and Jesus' actions and teachings were seen as fulfilling many Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the coming of a divine healer.<p><b>they were filled with awe</b><br>The awe experienced by the people can be understood as a mixture of reverence, fear, and wonder. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter the divine or witness miraculous events (e.g., <a href="/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, where the Israelites were afraid to come near Moses after he spoke with God). The awe here may also be linked to the residual glory of the Transfiguration, as Jesus' appearance might have been altered in a way that reflected His divine nature, similar to Moses' shining face after encountering God.<p><b>and ran to greet Him</b><br>The act of running to greet Jesus demonstrates the eagerness and urgency of the crowd to be near Him. This eagerness can be seen throughout the Gospels, where people often go to great lengths to see Jesus, hear His teachings, or seek healing (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-24</a>, where Jairus urgently seeks Jesus to heal his daughter). The cultural context of the time placed great importance on hospitality and honor, and running to greet someone of importance was a sign of respect and recognition of their authority. This response also highlights the people's hope and expectation that Jesus could meet their needs, whether physical, spiritual, or both.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose presence inspires awe and draws people to Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people who are immediately drawn to Jesus, indicating His magnetic presence and the impact of His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the surrounding context, often learning from Jesus' interactions with the crowd.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_transfiguration.htm">Mount of Transfiguration</a></b><br>The preceding event where Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John, revealing His divine glory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are often in opposition to Jesus, present in the surrounding context, questioning His authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_awe_of_jesus'_presence.htm">The Awe of Jesus' Presence</a></b><br>Jesus' presence naturally draws people to Him, indicating His divine nature and authority.

It seems most probable that they saw in his countenance, always heavenly and majestic, something even yet more Divine, retaining some traces of the glory of his transfiguration, even as the face of Moses shone when he came down from the mount (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a>). It hardly seems likely that the amazement of the people was simply caused by our Lord having arrived at an opportune time to relieve his disciples of their difficulty. The Greek word expresses something more than would be satisfied by the fact of our Lord having come upon the scene just when he was wanted. Even if there were no remains of the transfiguration glory upon his countenance, the vivid recollection of the scene, of the conversation with Moses and Elijah, and the subject of it, and the voice of the Father, must have invested his countenance with a peculiar majesty and dignity. The same word, though without its compound (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), is used further on in <a href="/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a> to express the amazement of the disciples, as he pressed eagerly onwards before them on his way to Jerusalem and to his cross. There was no doubt something then in his countenance which astonished them. The multitude running to him, saluted him. The scribes had not been able to shake their faith. In their view he was still "that Prophet that should come into the world." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
