They often contained hidden meanings that required contemplation and spiritual insight to understand. In this context, Jesus uses a parable to address the religious leaders, illustrating truths about God's kingdom and their responsibilities.<p><b>A man planted a vineyard:</b><br>The vineyard is a symbol frequently used in the Old Testament to represent Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The man represents God, who established Israel as His chosen people, providing them with everything needed to flourish spiritually. This imagery would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, evoking themes of divine care and expectation.<p><b>He put a wall around it:</b><br>The wall signifies protection and separation, indicating God's provision and safeguarding of Israel. It also implies a boundary, setting apart His people from the surrounding nations. This reflects God's covenant relationship with Israel, where He provided laws and commandments to guide and protect them.<p><b>Dug a wine vat:</b><br>The wine vat is a symbol of expectation for fruitfulness. In a vineyard, the wine vat is where the harvested grapes are processed into wine, representing the anticipated spiritual fruitfulness of Israel. This expectation is rooted in God's desire for His people to produce righteousness and justice.<p><b>And built a watchtower:</b><br>The watchtower serves as a place of vigilance and oversight, symbolizing God's watchful care and the responsibility of the leaders to guard and nurture the spiritual well-being of the people. It also implies readiness against external threats, emphasizing the need for spiritual alertness.<p><b>Then he rented it out to some tenants:</b><br>The tenants represent the religious leaders of Israel, who were entrusted with the care and leadership of God's people. This arrangement highlights the responsibility and accountability expected from those in spiritual authority. The concept of stewardship is central, as the leaders were to manage God's vineyard faithfully.<p><b>And went away on a journey:</b><br>The journey signifies God's trust in the leaders to manage His vineyard in His absence. It also implies a period of testing, where the true character and faithfulness of the tenants would be revealed. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's patience and the eventual accountability of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who uses parables to teach spiritual truths.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of Israel, often used in the Old Testament to represent God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man (Owner)</a></b><br>Represents God, who establishes and cares for His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Symbolize the religious leaders of Israel, entrusted with the care of God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>Indicates God's trust in the tenants to manage His vineyard in His absence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_care.htm">God's Provision and Care</a></b><br>God has provided abundantly for His people, symbolized by the well-equipped vineyard.<br><br>Reflect on how God has equipped and provided for you in your life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_stewardship.htm">Responsibility and Stewardship</a></b><br>The tenants were entrusted with the care of the vineyard, highlighting the responsibility of stewardship.<br><br>Consider how you are stewarding the resources and responsibilities God has given you.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>The parable foreshadows the accountability the tenants will face, reminding us of our own accountability to God.<br><br>Evaluate areas in your life where you need to be more accountable to God's expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_god's_messengers.htm">Rejection of God's Messengers</a></b><br>The parable hints at the rejection of prophets and ultimately Jesus Himself by the religious leaders.<br><br>Reflect on how you respond to God's messages and messengers in your life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_justice.htm">God's Patience and Justice</a></b><br>The owner's patience with the tenants shows God's long-suffering nature, but justice will ultimately prevail.<br><br>Trust in God's timing and justice, even when it seems delayed.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_12_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 12:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_12_1_God_s_patience_expectations.htm">How does Mark 12:1 illustrate God's patience and expectations for His people?

The parable which, like that of the Sower, and like that only, is related in all the first three Gospels, was one which had obviously impressed itself strongly, as that had done, on the minds of those who heard it, and was reproduced by independent reporters with an almost textual exactness.<p><span class= "bld">A place for the winefat.</span>--Better, simply, <span class= "ital">a vine vat.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he began to speak unto them in parables</span>. This particular parable which follows was specially directed against the scribes and Pharisees; but it was uttered in the presence of a multitude of the people. "He <span class="accented">began</span> to speak... in parables." He had not used this form of instruction till now in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">A man planted a vineyard</span>. The imagery of the parable would be familiar to them from Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>). But Palestine was eminently a land of "vineyards," as well as of "oil olives." The man who planted the vineyard is no other than God himself. "Thou hast brought a vine" out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it." The imagery is specially appropriate. No property was considered to yield so rich a return as the vineyard, and none required such unceasing care and attention. The vine represents the kingdom of God in its idea and conception; not the Jewish Church in particular. The owner of this vineyard had himself made it. (He had "planted it." This planting took place in the establishment of the Jewish polity in the land of Canaan, when the heathen were cast out. <span class="cmt_word">He set a hedge about it</span>. This and the following descriptions are not mere ornaments of the parable. The "hedge" was an important protection to the vineyard. It might be a wall or a "quick hedge," a living fence. The vineyards in the East may now be seen often with a strong hedge planted round them. Such hedges, made of the prickly cactus, are to be seen at this day in the neighborhood of Joppa. Figuratively, this hedge would represent the middle wall of partition which then existed between the Jew and the Gentile; and in this, their separation from the idolatrous nations around them, lay the security of the Jews that they should enjoy the continued protection of God. It is well remarked by Archbishop Trench that the geographical position of Judaea was figurative of this, the spiritual separation of the people - guarded as Judaea was eastward by the river Jordan and its chain of lakes, northward by Antilibanus, southward by the desert and Idumaea, and westward by the Mediterranean Sea. <span class="cmt_word">Digged a place for the winepress</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">torcular</span>); the words are literally, <span class="accented">digged a pit for the winepress</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); the digging could only apply to the pit, a place hollowed out and then fitted with masonry. Sometimes these pits were formed out of the solid rock. Examples of these are frequent in Palestine. There were usually two pits hollowed out of the rock, one sloping to the other, and with openings between them. The grapes were placed in the upper pit; and the juice, crushed out by the feet of men, flowed into the lower pit, from whence it was taken out and put into wine-skins. "I have trodden the winepress alone." <span class="cmt_word">And built a tower</span>. The tower (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) was probably the watch-tower, where a watchman was placed to guard the vineyard from plunderers. Particular directions are given in the rabbinical writings (see Lightfoot) for the dimensions both of the winepress and of the tower. The tower was to be ten cubits high and four cubits square. It is described as "a high place, where the vine-dresser stands to overlook the vineyard." Such towers are still to be seen in Palestine, especially in the neighborhood of Bethlehem, of Hebron, and in the vine-growing districts of Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">And let it out to husbandmen</span>. The husbandmen would be the ordinary stated teachers of the people, though not excluding the people themselves. The Jewish nation in fact, both the teachers and the taught, represented the husbandmen, each member of the Church, then as now, being required to seek the welfare of the whole, body. <span class="cmt_word">And went into a far country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">and went into another country.</span> St. Luke (<a href="/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9</a>) adds (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>), "for a long time." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] began</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#961;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;rxato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_756.htm">Strong's 756: </a> </span><span class="str2">To begin.
