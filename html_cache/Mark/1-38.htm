The mention of "neighboring towns" suggests a deliberate plan to cover more ground, reflecting the itinerant nature of His ministry.<p><b>so I can preach there as well</b><br>Preaching was central to Jesus' mission.

In any case, however, the disciples in this stage of their progress, would hardly enter, as we enter, into the full meaning of that mission.
