Prior to this, Jesus had been performing miracles and teaching in various regions, including the healing of Jairus' daughter and the woman with the issue of blood. This movement signifies the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry, as He traveled throughout Galilee and beyond, spreading His message. It reflects the fulfillment of His mission to preach the Kingdom of God to all, as seen in <a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>.<p><b>and came to His hometown</b><br>Jesus' hometown is Nazareth, a small village in Galilee. Nazareth was not highly regarded, as reflected in Nathanael's question in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" This visit to Nazareth is significant because it highlights the fulfillment of prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). It also sets the stage for the rejection Jesus would face from those who knew Him from His youth, illustrating the theme of a prophet not being honored in his own country (<a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>).<p><b>accompanied by His disciples</b><br>The presence of His disciples underscores the role of Jesus as a rabbi or teacher, with His followers learning from His actions and teachings. This journey with His disciples also serves as a training ground for them, as they witness firsthand the challenges and opposition Jesus faces. The disciples' presence is crucial for the continuation of Jesus' mission after His ascension, as they would become the apostles who spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is returning to His hometown.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hometown.htm">Hometown</a></b><br>Refers to Nazareth, where Jesus grew up.

The shift underscores that miracles never distracted Him from the broader mission (<a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar rhythm appears in <a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>, where Jesus &#8220;went through all the towns and villages.&#8221; Each departure foreshadows the Great Commission pattern of going (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The deliberate &#8220;went on&#8221; models obedience to the Father&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and came to His hometown</b><p>&#8226; Nazareth, the place where He had grown up (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>), receives another visit.

Nazareth would be about a day's journey from Capernaum. This was not the first public exercise of his ministry at Nazareth. Of that and its results St. Luke gives us the account (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>). It would seem reasonable to suppose that, after the fame which he had now acquired, he should again visit the place where he had been brought up. His sisters were still living there. St. Mark here again uses the historical present <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "he cometh," for which there is better authority than for <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">His disciples follow him</span>.
