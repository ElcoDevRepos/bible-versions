Synagogues were central to Jewish religious life, serving as places of worship, teaching, and community gathering. Jesus' presence in the synagogue underscores His role as a teacher and His engagement with Jewish religious practices. This setting also highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, as synagogues were often places where He encountered opposition. The phrase "once again" suggests that Jesus' ministry was consistent and persistent, emphasizing His commitment to reaching the Jewish people.<p><b>and a man with a withered hand was there</b><br>The presence of a man with a withered hand introduces a situation that sets the stage for a miraculous healing, demonstrating Jesus' compassion and divine authority. The term "withered hand" suggests a condition of paralysis or severe atrophy, rendering the hand useless. In the cultural context, physical disabilities often led to social and economic marginalization. This man's presence in the synagogue may indicate his desire for healing or spiritual solace. The healing that follows serves as a testament to Jesus' power over physical ailments and His willingness to restore individuals to wholeness.

He did not act sporadically; He consistently engaged with the people in their places of worship (<a href="/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21</a>; <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>).<p>- Scripture records Him teaching, healing, and confronting error each time He returned, showing faithfulness to His mission and to the Father&#8217;s timing (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>).<p>- The wording underscores reliability: what follows is not anecdotal but a factual continuation of His public work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus entered the synagogue</b><p>- Synagogues were centers of Scripture reading and community life. By entering, Jesus placed Himself squarely within the everyday religious rhythm of Israel (<a href="/matthew/12-9.htm">Matthew 12:9</a>; <a href="/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6</a>).<p>- His presence fulfilled the Law, never ignored it (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). He came not to overthrow the gathering of God&#8217;s people but to illuminate its true purpose.<p>- Previous visits (<a href="/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21&#8211;28</a>) had already demonstrated His authority over teaching and unclean spirits. This entrance anticipates another revelation of that authority&#8212;this time over human infirmity.<p>- It also set the stage for conflict with religious leaders who valued tradition over mercy (<a href="/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a man with a withered hand was there</b><p>- The description is concise yet poignant: permanent disability, likely muscle atrophy, leaving the man unable to work fully or participate in aspects of worship requiring both hands (cf. <a href="/leviticus/21-18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a> for priestly restrictions).<p>- His presence was not random; in divine providence he stood where the Healer would be. Similar encounters&#8212;such as the blind man in <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a> and the bent woman in <a href="/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11</a>&#8212;show Jesus seeking out the afflicted to display God&#8217;s works.<p>- The man&#8217;s need highlights the tension between compassion and legalism. On the Sabbath, religious leaders would scrutinize any healing (<a href="/luke/6-7.htm">Luke 6:7&#8211;11</a>). Jesus was about to demonstrate that mercy fulfills the heart of God&#8217;s law (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/3-1.htm">Mark 3:1</a> sets the scene for a pivotal Sabbath miracle. By repeatedly entering the synagogue, Jesus affirmed corporate worship and the authority of Scripture; by focusing on a man with a withered hand, He exposed the spiritual paralysis of legalism. The verse prepares readers to witness Christ&#8217;s power, compassion, and lordship&#8212;reminding us that wherever people gather to hear God&#8217;s Word, the Savior still comes to restore what is broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">III.</span><p>(1-6) <span class= "bld">A man there which had a withered hand.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-9.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he went into their synagogue:">Matthew 12:9-14</a>. St. Mark omits the reference to the sheep fallen into a pit, and, on the other hand, gives more graphically our Lord's "looking round" with an "anger" which yet had in it a touch as of pitying grief. The form of the Greek participle implies compassion as well as sorrow. St. Mark alone names (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) the Herodians as joining with the Pharisees in their plot for His destruction.

And there was a man there which had a withered hand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>); literally<span class="accented">, which had his hand withered</span>, or <span class="accented">dried up. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And they watched him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">kept watching him.</span> There were probably scribes sent for this purpose from Jerusalem. St. Jerome informs us that in an apocryphal Gospel in use amongst the Nazarenes and Ebionites, the man whose hand was withered is described as a mason, and is said to have asked for help in the following terms: - "I was a mason, seeking my living by manual labour. I beseech thee, Jesus, to restore me the use of my hand, that I may not be compelled to beg my bread." This is so far consistent with St. Mark's description (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) as to show that the malady was the result of disease or accident, and not congenital. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6</a>) informs us that it was the right hand. The disease probably extended through the whole arm according to the wider meaning of the Greek word It seems to have been a kind of atrophy, causing a gradual drying up of the limb; which in such a condition was beyond the reach of any mere human skill. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] entered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eis&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
