In the context of <a href="/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>, Jesus has just rebuked the unclean spirit, demonstrating His authority over demonic forces. This moment is pivotal, showcasing the immediate power of Jesus' words.<p><b>the unclean spirit</b><br>Unclean spirits, or demons, are spiritual beings opposed to God, often associated with impurity and evil. In Jewish culture, they were believed to cause physical and mental afflictions. The presence of an unclean spirit highlights the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in the Gospels, where Jesus confronts and overcomes evil.<p><b>threw the man into convulsions</b><br>The convulsions indicate the violent reaction of the demon as it is forced to leave. This physical manifestation underscores the struggle between the spiritual and physical realms. It also reflects the destructive nature of demonic possession, which contrasts with the peace and healing Jesus brings.<p><b>and came out</b><br>The departure of the unclean spirit signifies Jesus' victory and authority over demonic forces. This act fulfills prophecies about the Messiah's power to liberate captives (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate defeat of evil through Jesus' death and resurrection.<p><b>with a loud shriek</b><br>The loud shriek is a final act of defiance and recognition of Jesus' authority. It serves as a public acknowledgment of Jesus' power, reinforcing His divine nature.

It could hardly here mean physically "laceration," for St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>) is careful to say that "when the devil had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt." At all events, the expression indicates the close union of the evil spirit with the possessed man's consciousness and with his physical frame. And the manner in which he departed showed his malignity, as though, being compelled by the supreme authority of Christ to leave the man, he would injure him as far as he was able to do so. But the power of Christ prevented him from doing any real injury. And all this was done <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that there might be clear evidence that the man was actually possessed by the evil spirit; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the anger and malice of the evil spirit might be shown; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it might be manifest that the unclean spirit came out, not of his own accord, but constrained and vanquished by Christ. We may observe also that the power of Christ restrained him from the use of any articulate words. While he was in possession he used the possessed man's organs of speech; but when he came out there was no articulate speech - it was nothing but a cry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
