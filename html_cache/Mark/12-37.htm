This is significant because it establishes the divine nature of the Messiah, who is greater than David. In Jewish tradition, the Messiah was expected to be a descendant of David, a human king who would restore Israel. By calling the Messiah "Lord," David acknowledges His superiority and divine authority. This challenges the prevailing Jewish understanding of the Messiah as merely a political leader.<p><b>So how can He be David&#8217;s son?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus poses this rhetorical question to highlight the dual nature of the Messiah as both human and divine. While the Messiah is a descendant of David (as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), He is also the eternal Son of God. This question underscores the mystery of the Incarnation, where Jesus is both fully God and fully man. It invites the audience to reconsider their expectations of the Messiah and recognize Jesus' unique identity.<p><b>And the large crowd listened to Him with delight.</b><br>The crowd's reaction indicates that Jesus' teaching was both engaging and thought-provoking. His ability to confound the religious leaders and present profound truths in a simple manner resonated with the people. This delight also reflects the growing popularity of Jesus among the common people, who were often marginalized by the religious elite. The crowd's response contrasts with the hostility of the religious leaders, highlighting the divide between those open to Jesus' message and those resistant to it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The revered king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a prophet.
