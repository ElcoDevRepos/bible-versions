The Sadducees, who posed this question to Jesus, did not believe in the resurrection, unlike the Pharisees who did. The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, which discusses the resurrection of the dead and the hope it provides to believers. The question posed here is intended to challenge Jesus on the logistics of resurrection, reflecting the Sadducees' skepticism.<p><b>whose wife will she be?</b><br>This question is based on the Levirate marriage law found in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, where a man is required to marry his brother's widow if the brother dies without leaving children. The Sadducees use this law to create a hypothetical scenario to test Jesus. The question is designed to highlight what they perceive as the absurdity of resurrection, by suggesting a complicated marital situation that would arise. This reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where family lineage and inheritance were of significant importance.<p><b>For all seven were married to her.&#8221;</b><br>The scenario involves a woman who was married to seven brothers, each of whom died without leaving children. This hyperbolic situation is meant to emphasize the perceived impracticality of resurrection. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, which may suggest the totality of the argument the Sadducees are trying to make. This phrase also highlights the Sadducees' misunderstanding of the nature of the resurrection life, which Jesus addresses in His response, indicating that earthly institutions like marriage do not apply in the same way in the afterlife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question posed by the Sadducees.
