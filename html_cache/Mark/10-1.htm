He had been in Galilee, a region where He performed many miracles and taught extensively. The departure signifies a shift towards the final phase of His earthly ministry, which would culminate in Jerusalem. This movement is part of the divine plan leading to His crucifixion and resurrection.<p><b>and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan.</b><br>Judea was a significant region for the Jewish people, containing Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. "Beyond the Jordan" refers to the area known as Perea, east of the Jordan River. This journey highlights Jesus' intentional movement towards Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and death. The geographical reference also connects to the ministry of John the Baptist, who baptized in this region, preparing the way for Jesus.<p><b>Again the crowds came to Him</b><br>The repeated mention of crowds emphasizes Jesus' growing popularity and the widespread interest in His teachings and miracles. Despite the increasing opposition from religious leaders, the common people were drawn to Him, seeking healing, wisdom, and hope. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, where the people walking in darkness have seen a great light.<p><b>and He taught them, as was His custom.</b><br>Teaching was a central aspect of Jesus' ministry. His teachings often challenged the religious norms of the day, focusing on the heart of the Law rather than mere external observance. This phrase underscores His role as the ultimate Rabbi and Teacher, imparting divine wisdom and truth.

Putting the accounts together, we conclude that, being refused by the Samaritans, he passed eastwards along their frontier, having Galilee on his left, and Samaria on his right; and then crossed the Jordan, perhaps at Scythopolis, where was a bridge, and so entered Peraea. As Judaea and Galilee both lay west of the Jordan, this route above described would be literally coming "to the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan."
