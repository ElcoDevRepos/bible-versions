Jesus elevates their importance, emphasizing humility and service. Welcoming a child in His name signifies accepting those who are humble and dependent, reflecting the kingdom values of humility and servitude. This phrase also highlights the importance of doing acts of kindness and service in the name of Jesus, which aligns with His teachings on love and compassion.<p><b>and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the unity between Jesus and God the Father. In the Jewish tradition, a messenger was often seen as an extension of the one who sent him. By welcoming Jesus, one is also welcoming God, as Jesus is the divine representative of the Father. This reflects the theological concept of the Trinity, where Jesus and the Father are distinct yet one in essence.<p><b>but the One who sent Me</b><br>This phrase refers to God the Father, who sent Jesus into the world. It emphasizes the divine mission of Jesus and His role as the Messiah. The sending of Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah, which speak of a coming servant who will bring salvation. This connection reinforces the idea that accepting Jesus is integral to accepting God's plan for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the nature of true greatness in the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are being instructed on humility and service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_little_child.htm">A Little Child</a></b><br>Represents innocence, humility, and the least in society, whom Jesus uses as an example to teach a profound spiritual truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_humility.htm">The Value of Humility</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that true greatness is found in humility and service, not in status or power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/welcoming_the_least.htm">Welcoming the Least</a></b><br>By welcoming a child, we are called to embrace those who are often overlooked or undervalued in society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_character.htm">Reflecting Christ's Character</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are to embody His humility and love, serving others selflessly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_perspective.htm">The Kingdom Perspective</a></b><br>Jesus challenges worldly views of greatness, inviting us to adopt a kingdom mindset that values humility and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_childlike_faith.htm">The Importance of Childlike Faith</a></b><br>Embracing a childlike faith means trusting God fully and approaching Him with innocence and openness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_9_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 9:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_welcome_others_like_Jesus_today.htm">How can we welcome others as Jesus describes in Mark 9:37 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_receives_a_child_mean.htm">What does "receives one of these little children" mean in our context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_9_37_Matt_18_5_Welcoming_children.htm">How does Mark 9:37 connect with Matthew 18:5 on welcoming children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_Christ_s_humility_daily.htm">In what ways can we embody Christ's humility in our daily interactions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Welcoming_others_our_bond_with_God.htm">How does welcoming others reflect our relationship with God and Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_9_37_Receiving_Jesus_and_God.htm">What does Mark 9:37 reveal about the nature of receiving Jesus and God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_9_37_Rethink_greatness_humility.htm">How does Mark 9:37 challenge our understanding of greatness and humility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_9_37_stress_welcoming_kids.htm">In what ways does Mark 9:37 emphasize the importance of welcoming children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_stress_over_tomorrow_today.htm">What happens to young children after they die?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_true_christian.htm">What defines a true Christian?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_injustices_persist_if_karma_is_true.htm">If 'a man reaps what he sows' (Galatians 6:7) is universally true, why do injustices and unmerited suffering persist?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/honor_parents_or_not_(ex._20_12_vs._lk._14_26).htm">Should we honor our parents?

St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-48.htm">Luke 9:48</a>) says, 'Whosoever shall receive <span class="accented">this little child</span> in my Name receiveth me." Our Lord, therefore, speaks first, literally of a little child, and secondly, in a mystical sense, of those who are like little children; making that little child in his arms the figure and type of all those who are like little children. The sense, therefore, of his words is this: "Humility, which is the foundation and the measure of spiritual perfection, so pleases me that I delight in little children. And all who would be my disciples must become as little children, and so will they deserve to be received by all; for men will think that they receive me in them, because they receive them for my sake." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8011;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">welcomes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;&#958;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dex&#275;tai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1209.htm">Strong's 1209: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take, receive, accept, welcome.
