The number "five thousand" refers specifically to men, not including women and children, which suggests the total number of people fed could have been significantly higher. This event is one of the few miracles recorded in all four Gospels (<a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>, <a href="/luke/9-14.htm">Luke 9:14</a>, <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>), emphasizing its importance. The large crowd reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the people's eagerness to hear His teachings and witness His miracles. In the cultural context of the time, counting only men was a common practice, reflecting the patriarchal society.<p><b>who had eaten the loaves.</b><br>The loaves refer to the five barley loaves that Jesus miraculously multiplied to feed the multitude. This miracle demonstrates Jesus' divine authority over creation and His compassion for the physical needs of the people. It also serves as a foreshadowing of the Last Supper and the spiritual nourishment that Jesus provides as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The act of eating together in the Jewish culture was significant, symbolizing fellowship and community. This miracle also recalls the provision of manna in the wilderness during the Exodus (Exodus 16), drawing a parallel between Moses and Jesus as providers for God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the five thousand.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distributed the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Comprising five thousand men, not including women and children, who were fed by Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_feeding_the_five_thousand.htm">The Miracle of Feeding the Five Thousand</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus multiplies five loaves and two fish to feed a large crowd.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethsaida.htm">Bethsaida</a></b><br>The region where this miracle took place, near the Sea of Galilee.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundant_provision.htm">God's Abundant Provision</a></b><br>Just as Jesus provided for the physical needs of the crowd, God is able to meet our needs abundantly.
