It was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>).

Understanding the Sabbath's original intent is crucial for interpreting this passage.<p><b>Jesus was passing through the grainfields</b><br>This setting indicates a rural area, likely in Galilee, where agriculture was common. The grainfields would have been fields of wheat or barley, staple crops in ancient Israel.

The disciples' actions were lawful under Mosaic Law but were scrutinized by the Pharisees due to their interpretation of Sabbath laws.<p><b>as they walked along</b><br>This phrase suggests a casual, everyday activity, emphasizing the normalcy of the disciples' actions.

St. Luke (<a href="/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a>) here adds to St. Mark's account the words, "and did eat, rubbing them [that is, the ears of corn] in their hands;" an incidental evidence of a simple life, that they did not here eat prepared food, but the simple grains of wheat, which they separated from the chaff by rubbing the ears of corn in their hands. This passage marks with some nicety the time of the year. The corn in that district would be ripening about May. It would, therefore, be not long after the Passover. The difficult expression in St. <a href="/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, and which is rendered in the Authorized Version "on the second sabbath after the first," is reduced by the Revisers of 1881 to the simple phrase (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>), "on a sabbath," there not being sufficient evidence to persuade them to retain the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>. But other evidences seem to show that the incident occurred earlier than as recorded by St. Matthew. The Fathers are fond of spiritual applications of this rubbing of the ears of corn. Bede, in remarking upon the fact of the disciples plucking the ears of corn, and rubbing them until they get rid of the husks, and obtain the food itself, says that they do this who meditate upon the Holy Scriptures, and digest them, until they find in them the kernel, the quintessence of delight; and St. Augustine blames those who merely please themselves with the flowers of Holy Scripture, but do not rub out the grain by meditation, until they obtain the real nourishment of virtue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
