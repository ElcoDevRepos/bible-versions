In the context of <a href="/mark/8.htm">Mark 8</a>, Jesus had already attempted to heal the man once, which is unique among His miracles. This two-step healing process may symbolize the gradual understanding and spiritual enlightenment of the disciples, who often struggled to fully grasp Jesus' teachings. The act of placing hands is a common biblical gesture of blessing and healing, seen in other instances such as in the healing of Jairus' daughter (<a href="/mark/5-23.htm">Mark 5:23</a>) and the laying on of hands for the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>).<p><b>and when he opened them his sight was restored</b><br>The restoration of sight is a powerful metaphor for spiritual awakening and understanding. In the Old Testament, blindness often symbolizes spiritual ignorance or judgment (<a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>). Jesus' ability to restore sight fulfills messianic prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened. This miracle serves as a physical manifestation of Jesus' mission to bring light to a darkened world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>and he could see everything clearly</b><br>The clarity of vision represents complete healing and understanding. This contrasts with the partial sight the man experienced earlier, symbolizing the disciples' journey from confusion to clarity regarding Jesus' identity and mission. The Greek word used for "clearly" (&#964;&#951;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#947;&#8182;&#962;) implies seeing at a distance, suggesting not just physical sight but also insight and perception. This moment foreshadows the eventual full revelation of Jesus' nature and purpose to His followers, culminating in Peter's confession of Christ (<a href="/mark/8-29.htm">Mark 8:29</a>) and the transfiguration (<a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of healing the blind man.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' healing, representing those in need of spiritual and physical restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethsaida.htm">Bethsaida</a></b><br>The location where this miracle takes place, a town known for its unbelief despite witnessing many miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/progressive_revelation.htm">Progressive Revelation</a></b><br>Just as the blind man's sight was restored in stages, our spiritual understanding often grows progressively.

The same Savior who &#8220;took the children in His arms and blessed them, laying His hands on them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>) now places His hands deliberately on blind eyes.<p>&#8226; Repetition underscores patient compassion. Earlier He had already touched the man and asked what he could see (<a href="/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23&#8211;24</a>). Instead of leaving the healing half&#8211;done, Jesus stays until the work is complete, echoing His pattern in <a href="/mark/7-32.htm">Mark 7:32&#8211;35</a> where He &#8220;put His fingers into the man&#8217;s ears&#8230; and his ears were opened.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hands, not words alone. The scene fulfills prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, &#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,&#8221; demonstrating that the Messiah&#8217;s power is physical as well as spiritual.<p>&#8226; Personal involvement signals value. <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD gives sight to the blind.&#8221; By touching, Jesus shows Himself to be that covenant&#8211;keeping LORD in the flesh.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when he opened them</b><p>&#8226; The man cooperates with the Savior. Just as the blind man in <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a> &#8220;went and washed, and came back seeing,&#8221; this man must open his eyelids to receive the miracle.<p>&#8226; A moment of obedience. <a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a> records lepers cleansed &#8220;as they went.&#8221; Faith is often verified in a simple, responsive act.<p>&#8226; Timing matters. Healing comes after the second touch, hinting that God sometimes works in stages even though His power is unlimited.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sight was restored</b><p>&#8226; Restoration signals wholeness. The verb implies returning to an original design marred by the fall (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a> for God&#8217;s &#8220;very good&#8221; creation).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment of messianic mission. Jesus had announced in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, quoting Isaiah, that He was sent &#8220;to proclaim recovery of sight for the blind.&#8221; <a href="/mark/8-25.htm">Mark 8:25</a> shows that promise occurring in real time.<p>&#8226; Proof of deity. Human doctors can assist eyes; only the Creator can instantly re-create them (<a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-34.htm">Matthew 20:34</a> where &#8220;Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he could see everything clearly</b><p>&#8226; Total clarity replaces partial vision. Moments earlier the man saw &#8220;people&#8230; like trees walking&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-24.htm">Mark 8:24</a>). Now there is no blur or shadow.<p>&#8226; Physical clarity mirrors the spiritual point Jesus makes to His disciples who, a few verses earlier, were chastised for having &#8220;eyes but fail to see&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-18.htm">Mark 8:18</a>). Their understanding will also come in stages until the resurrection.<p>&#8226; A picture of future perfection. &#8220;Now we see but a dim reflection; then we shall see face to face&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). One day every believer&#8217;s perception will match this man&#8217;s newfound clarity.<p>&#8226; Enlightened hearts. Paul prays in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a> that &#8220;the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,&#8221; the same outcome Jesus begins here.<p>&#8226; From darkness to light. &#8220;God&#8230; made His light shine in our hearts&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>). The miracle illustrates the gospel that opens blind eyes everywhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/8-25.htm">Mark 8:25</a> records the second, finishing touch of Jesus that moves a man from blurred shapes to perfect sight. The scene highlights Christ&#8217;s patient compassion, the necessity of responsive faith, and the Messiah&#8217;s power to restore what sin has broken. Physical clarity becomes a living parable of the spiritual insight He longs to give all who will trust and obey Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Every man.</span>--The better MSS. give "all things."

Now, here it pleased our Lord, not suddenly, but by degrees, to give perfect sight to this blind man. And this he did <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he might give examples of different kinds of miracles, showing that" there are differences of operations," and that he, as sovereign Lord, was not absolutely tied to any one particular method of working; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he might administer his power in increasing measures, as the faith of the recipient waxed stronger; that so he might gradually kindle greater hope and desire in him. It may be that the spiritual condition of this blind man was one which specially needed this gradual method of treatment. Our Lord was a wise and skillful Physician. At first he healed him in part, as one who imperfectly believed; that he who as yet saw little with a little sight, might believe more perfectly, and so be healed at last more perfectly; and thus by this miracle Christ teaches us that for the most part the unbeliever and the sinner is by degrees illuminated by God, so as to advance step by step in the knowledge and worship of God. "By this miracle," says Bede, "Christ teaches us how great is the spiritual blindness of man, which only by degrees, and by successive stages, can come to the light of Divine knowledge." The experiences of this blind man in gradually recovering his eyesight show as in a parable the stages of the spiritual change from absolute darkness to glimmering light, and thence to bright and clear vision. Cornelius a Lapide says, "We see an example of this in children and scholars, who must be taught and instructed by degrees. Otherwise, if the master, impatient of delay and labour, seeks to deliver all things to them at once, he will overwhelm their mind and their memory, so that they will take in nothing; as wine, when it is poured into a narrow-necked vessel, if you attempt to pour in the whole at once, scarcely any will enter, but almost all is wasted." A Lapide adds the well-known Italian proverb, "Piano, piano, siva lontano." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Eita)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1534.htm">Strong's 1534: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of succession, then, moreover.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] placed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#941;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epeth&#275;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2007.htm">Strong's 2007: </a> </span><span class="str2">To put, place upon, lay on; I add, give in addition.
