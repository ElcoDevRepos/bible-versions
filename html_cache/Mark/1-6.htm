This connection to Elijah is important because John is seen as the forerunner to Christ, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a> about Elijah's return before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord." Camel's hair was a coarse material, symbolizing John's ascetic lifestyle and his separation from worldly comforts, emphasizing his role as a prophet calling for repentance.<p><b>with a leather belt around his waist</b><br>The leather belt further aligns John with the prophet Elijah, who also wore a leather belt. This detail underscores John's prophetic authority and mission. In the cultural context of the time, a leather belt was practical for someone living in the wilderness, indicating readiness and simplicity. It also serves as a visual contrast to the fine clothing of the religious leaders, highlighting John's message of repentance and humility.<p><b>His food was locusts and wild honey</b><br>Locusts were considered clean food according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>), and they were a common source of protein in the region, especially for those living in the wilderness. Wild honey, found in rock crevices and trees, provided natural sweetness and energy. John's diet reflects his ascetic lifestyle and reliance on God's provision, setting him apart from the indulgence of the religious elite. This simple diet also symbolizes purity and a return to the basics, aligning with his call for spiritual renewal and preparation for the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophetic figure who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

John&#8217;s rough garment is literal, but it also signals:<p>&#8226; Continuity with Elijah, who &#8220;was a hairy man&#8230; with a leather belt girded around his waist&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>). <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a> and <a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a> connect that Elijah-like appearance with the promised forerunner of Messiah.<p>&#8226; A rejection of the soft fabrics worn in royal courts (<a href="/matthew/11-8.htm">Matthew 11:8</a>). John&#8217;s clothing shouts humility, separation from worldly luxury, and total devotion to his calling.<p>&#8226; Prophetic authenticity: <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a> mentions the &#8220;hairy cloak&#8221; once typical of true prophets. John&#8217;s attire quietly announces, &#8220;God has spoken&#8212;I&#8217;m here on His business.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A leather belt around his waist</b><p>&#8211; The belt is more than a fashion detail:<p>&#8226; Practically, it cinched the loose camel-hair garment, freeing John to move quickly through the rugged Judean wilderness.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it pictures readiness and truthfulness. Just as soldiers &#8220;stand firm&#8230; with the belt of truth buckled&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>), John stands for uncompromising truth, calling Israel to repent.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, to &#8220;gird up&#8221; often means to prepare for action (<a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>). John&#8217;s belt says he is alert, prepared, and single-minded about the coming King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His food was locusts</b><p>&#8211; The text means exactly what it says. John ate the large, protein-rich insects common to the region.<p>&#8226; Locusts are specifically listed among the creatures God declared clean and edible (<a href="/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>). John&#8217;s diet was both lawful and simple.<p>&#8226; His choice of food underlines a life free from earthly indulgence, matching the Nazarite-like call announced before his birth: &#8220;He is never to take wine or strong drink&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Eating what the wilderness readily provided freed John to focus entirely on preaching, showing that God sustains those who seek His kingdom first (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And wild honey</b><p>&#8211; Wild honey balanced the starkness of locusts, offering natural sweetness and energy:<p>&#8226; Scripture often links honey with God&#8217;s generous provision (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>). Even in barren places, the Lord supplied what His servant needed.<p>&#8226; The combination of locusts and honey underscores how God&#8217;s creation can fully sustain His people when they obey His call.<p>&#8226; Honey also reminds us of the promised &#8220;land flowing with milk and honey,&#8221; hinting that John&#8217;s message is the doorway to covenant blessing for those who repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In one vivid sentence, Mark shows us a prophet who looks, lives, and eats differently because he belongs entirely to God. John&#8217;s camel-hair cloak and leather belt tie him to Elijah and mark him as an authentic messenger. His austere diet of locusts and wild honey proclaims reliance on the Lord&#8217;s provision and rejection of worldly comforts. Taken together, these details reveal a life that backs up the message: &#8220;Prepare the way for the Lord.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And John was clothed</span>. . . .--See Note on <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with camel's hair</span>. This was a rough, coarse garment, characteristic of the doctrine which John taught, namely, penitence and contempt of the world. Camels abounded in Syria. <span class="cmt_word">And a leathern girdle about his loins</span>. Not only the prophets, but the Jews and the inhabitants of Syria generally, used a girdle to keep the long flowing garment more closely about them, so as to leave them more free for journeying or for labour. Thus our Lord says (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>), "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning." <span class="cmt_word">And he did eat locusts and wild</span> <span class="cmt_word">honey.</span> The insect called the locust (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) was permitted to be eaten (see <a href="/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>). It was used as food by the common people in Judaea. The Arabs eat them to this day; but they are considered as a common and inferior kind of food. They are a sign of temperance, poverty, and penitence. The wild honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) was simply honey made by wild bees, either in the trees or in the hollows of the rocks. Isidorus says that it was of an inferior flavour. Both these kinds of food were consistent with the austere life and the solemn preaching of the Baptist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">John</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
