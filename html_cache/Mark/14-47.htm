The term "bystanders" indicates those who were not part of the arresting party but were present with Jesus. In the Gospel of John, this bystander is identified as Peter (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>). The presence of bystanders highlights the tension and confusion of the moment, as Jesus' followers were not fully aware of the unfolding events.<p><b>drew his sword</b><br>The act of drawing a sword suggests a readiness to defend or protect. In the cultural and historical context, carrying a sword was not uncommon for self-defense. The disciples, expecting a messianic kingdom, may have anticipated a physical confrontation. This action reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, which was not to establish an earthly kingdom through violence.<p><b>and struck the servant of the high priest</b><br>The servant of the high priest, identified as Malchus in <a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>, was likely part of the group sent to arrest Jesus. The high priest held significant religious authority, and his servants would have been involved in maintaining order. This act of violence against a servant of such a high-ranking official underscores the gravity of the situation and the disciples' desperation.<p><b>cutting off his ear</b><br>The cutting off of the ear is a specific detail that emphasizes the impulsive and defensive nature of the act. In <a href="/luke/22-51.htm">Luke 22:51</a>, Jesus heals the servant's ear, demonstrating His commitment to peace and His divine authority. This miracle serves as a testament to Jesus' teachings on non-violence and love for one's enemies, contrasting with the expectations of a militant Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bystander.htm">Bystander</a></b><br>This refers to one of Jesus' disciples, specifically identified in other Gospels as Peter.

In that tension, one disciple reacts instinctively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>drew his sword</b><p>&#8226; The presence of a sword indicates the disciples expected possible conflict. <a href="/luke/22-38.htm">Luke 22:38</a> records they had two swords among them.<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s draw stresses self-reliance, contrasting with Jesus&#8217; earlier warnings that His kingdom would not advance by physical force (<a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>).<p>&#8226; This act exposes a misunderstanding: even after three years with the Lord, Peter still thinks earthly weapons can defend a heavenly mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and struck the servant of the high priest</b><p>&#8226; The target is not a soldier but a servant&#8212;<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a> names him Malchus. Peter lashes out at someone of lesser status and authority, showing how uncontrolled anger easily misfires.<p>&#8226; Ironically, Peter aims at a representative of the very priesthood plotting Jesus&#8217; death, yet damages only a servant, hinting at the futility of fleshly combat against spiritual forces (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later tells Peter, &#8220;Put your sword back in its place&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>)&#8212;a gentle yet firm rebuke underscoring that violence opposes His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cutting off his ear</b><p>&#8226; The injury is severe yet non-fatal, illustrating human aggression&#8217;s limited reach compared with divine sovereignty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/22-51.htm">Luke 22:51</a> records Jesus immediately heals the ear, displaying compassion even toward an enemy. That miracle halts further bloodshed and underscores His authority and mercy.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; healing also fulfills His own teaching: &#8220;Love your enemies&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). In the same moment Peter harms, Jesus heals, contrasting human impulse with divine love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/14-47.htm">Mark 14:47</a> highlights the clash between human zeal and God&#8217;s redemptive purpose. Peter&#8217;s impulsive sword-swing shows how easily fear and misunderstanding can lead believers to rely on worldly means. Yet Jesus&#8217; subsequent rebuke and healing prove His mission is accomplished not by force but by sacrificial love, fulfilling Scripture and revealing the true nature of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his</span> <span class="cmt_word">ear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).
