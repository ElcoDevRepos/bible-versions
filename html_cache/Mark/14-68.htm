This denial fulfills Jesus' earlier prophecy that Peter would disown Him three times before the rooster crowed (<a href="/mark/14-30.htm">Mark 14:30</a>). The act of denial is significant in Jewish culture, where loyalty and honor are highly valued. Peter's fear of association with Jesus during His trial reflects the intense pressure and danger faced by Jesus' followers.<p><b>&#8220;I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Peter's response is a strong disavowal, emphasizing both ignorance and misunderstanding. This reflects a common human reaction to fear and threat, where self-preservation can lead to denial of truth. The language used here is emphatic, indicating Peter's desperation to distance himself from Jesus. This moment is a stark contrast to Peter's earlier bold declarations of loyalty (<a href="/mark/14-29.htm">Mark 14:29-31</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the frailty of human resolve without divine strength.<p><b>Then he went out to the gateway,</b><br>The gateway likely refers to the entrance of the high priest's courtyard, a place of transition between the inner court and the outside world. This movement symbolizes Peter's physical and spiritual distancing from Jesus. The courtyard setting is significant, as it was a place where servants and guards gathered, increasing the risk of recognition and confrontation for Peter. This setting underscores the tension and danger of the moment.<p><b>and the rooster crowed.</b><br>The crowing of the rooster is a fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy and serves as a poignant reminder of Peter's failure. In the cultural context, the rooster's crow was associated with the early morning hours, marking the end of the night. This timing is symbolic of the dawning realization of Peter's denial and the beginning of his path to repentance. The rooster's crow is a call to awareness and reflection, both for Peter and for readers of the Gospel, highlighting themes of repentance and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and impulsive nature.

It amounts to this: "So little do I know who this Jesus is, that I know not what you say or what you ask concerning him. I know not who or what he is or anything about him. A question has been raised as to the number of times that Peter denied our Lord. The narratives are best explained by the consideration that all the denials took place in the house of Caiaphas. Furthermore, the accounts of the evangelists may be reconciled thus: First, Peter denied the Lord in the court of the high priest, when he was first asked by the maidservant, as he sat over the fire (Matthew 24:69); secondly, he denied him with an oath; thirdly, when urged still more, he denied him with many oaths and execrations. The cock crew the first time after the first denial, when we read (<a href="/matthew/26-71.htm">Matthew 26:71</a>) that he went out into the porch (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This crowing would be about one or two in the morning. The second crowing would not be until five or six. This shows us the length of time that the proceedings lasted.
