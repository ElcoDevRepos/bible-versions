In Jewish culture, the day began at sunset, but the early morning was often considered a time for new beginnings and spiritual renewal. This practice of rising early for prayer is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the life of King David (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>) and the patriarchs. It underscores the importance of prioritizing communion with God before the day's activities begin.<p><b>while it was still dark</b><br>The mention of darkness highlights the solitude and quietness of the time, allowing for undisturbed communion with God. Darkness can symbolize the challenges and trials of life, and Jesus' choice to pray during this time may reflect His desire to seek strength and guidance from the Father before facing the day's demands. This also emphasizes the discipline and intentionality in Jesus' spiritual life.<p><b>Jesus got up</b><br>This action demonstrates Jesus' commitment and intentionality in seeking time with the Father. It reflects His humanity, as He needed rest, yet chose to prioritize prayer. This serves as a model for believers to actively pursue a relationship with God, even when it requires sacrifice or effort.<p><b>and went out</b><br>Jesus' decision to leave His current location suggests a deliberate choice to find a place free from distractions. This act of physically moving to a different place for prayer is a practice seen in other biblical figures, such as Moses and Elijah, who often sought solitude to hear from God. It highlights the importance of creating an environment conducive to focused prayer.<p><b>to a solitary place</b><br>The solitary place, or "desolate place," is significant as it represents a setting away from the busyness and demands of daily life. In the Gospels, Jesus frequently withdrew to such places to pray (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). This practice underscores the necessity of solitude in spiritual life, allowing for deeper reflection and connection with God.<p><b>to pray</b><br>Prayer was central to Jesus' ministry and life, serving as a means of communication with the Father. This act of prayer before significant events or decisions is a recurring theme in the Gospels, such as before choosing the twelve apostles (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>) or before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-44</a>). It highlights the dependence on God for guidance, strength, and alignment with His will. Jesus' prayer life serves as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of regular, intentional communication with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who demonstrates the importance of prayer and communion with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solitary_place.htm">Solitary Place</a></b><br>This refers to a remote or secluded location where Jesus could be alone with God, away from distractions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, which Jesus prioritized even amidst His busy ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_priority_of_prayer.htm">The Priority of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus prioritized prayer above all else, even when He was busy.

Jesus chose the dawn hours&#8212;before the day&#8217;s demands&#8212;to meet with the Father (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>). Because the Son is our perfect example (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>), His pattern invites us to carve out first-fruits time with God, giving Him the best of our attention rather than leftovers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while it was still dark</b><p>The darkness underscores both the quiet and the cost. Jesus sought communion before distractions stirred (<a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>). Rising when others slept reflected discipline (<a href="/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9-11</a>) and underscored dependence on divine strength rather than public acclaim (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>). The unseen moments of fellowship prepared Him for the visible moments of ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus got up</b><p>Action follows desire. Christ physically left the comfort of rest to fulfill spiritual necessity (<a href="/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a>). His getting up shows that intimacy with the Father is chosen, not accidental (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14-16</a>). If the sinless Son needed this communion, how much more do we?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went out</b><p>Stepping outside the house marked separation from competing voices (<a href="/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29-33</a>). Movement away from noise and need&#8212;though temporary&#8212;was essential for renewed effectiveness (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>). Jesus teaches that withdrawal for prayer is not escape but preparation (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to a solitary place</b><p>Solitude provides an uncluttered arena for hearing God (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>). In lonely places prophets were shaped (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9-13</a>), and here the Messiah models the same rhythm. Silence amplifies Scripture and stirs sensitivity to the Spirit (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>). Such spaces can be anywhere we intentionally remove distractions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to pray</b><p>Prayer crowned the purpose of His early rising. Jesus communed, listened, and aligned with the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>). His intercession fuels ours; the Savior who prayed on earth now intercedes in heaven (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>). Prayer is partnership, warfare, and communion all at once (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a> shows Jesus setting a pattern: intentional time, chosen discipline, purposeful solitude, and wholehearted prayer. The verse calls believers to prioritize private fellowship with the Father, trusting that hidden moments with Him empower public ministry and daily obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">A great while before day.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">very early, while it was yet night.</span> The note of time is peculiar to St. Mark. Prayer seems to have been sought now, as at other times, after a day of extraordinary and exhausting labour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the morning, at great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed</span>. Our Lord thus prepared himself by prayer for his first departure on a missionary tour. This would be the morning of the first day of the week. A great while before day he left the scene of excitement. That was not a time for preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom. The miracles attracted attention to him, but they were not the object for which he came. They were necessary as means of stirring and awakening men's minds, and of fixing their attention upon him and upon the great salvation which he came to reveal. So he left the miracles to do their subordinate work; and he himself went into a desert place, that he might pray with more quiet and less distraction. He retired that he might escape the applause of men, which they were ready to lavish upon him after seeing so many miracles; that he might thus teach us to shun the praise of men. Let us learn from Christ to give the early morning to prayer, and to rise with the dawn of day, that we may have time for meditation, and give the firstfruits of the morning to God. The early morning is favorable for study; but it is specially dear to God and his angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Early in the morning,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#8146;</span> <span class="translit">(pr&#333;i)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4404.htm">Strong's 4404: </a> </span><span class="str2">Early in the morning, at dawn.
