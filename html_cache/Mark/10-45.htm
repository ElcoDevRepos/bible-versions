Jesus frequently uses this title to emphasize both His humanity and His divine authority. It reflects His role as the representative of humanity and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<p><b>did not come to be served</b><br>In the cultural context of the first century, leaders and kings were typically served by others. Jesus contrasts this expectation by highlighting His mission as one of humility and service. This statement challenges the disciples' understanding of greatness and leadership, which they often equated with power and status.<p><b>but to serve</b><br>Jesus exemplifies servant leadership, a concept that is countercultural both in His time and today. His life and ministry were marked by acts of service, such as healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and washing the disciples' feet (<a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1-17</a>). This phrase underscores the call for His followers to adopt a similar posture of humility and service.<p><b>and to give His life</b><br>This phrase foreshadows Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. It highlights the voluntary nature of His sacrifice, emphasizing that He willingly laid down His life. This act of giving is central to the Christian understanding of atonement and redemption.<p><b>as a ransom for many</b><br>The term "ransom" refers to the price paid to release someone from bondage or captivity. In the biblical context, it signifies Jesus' death as the means of liberating humanity from sin and death. The word "many" indicates the vast scope of His redemptive work, aligning with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11-12</a>, which speak of the suffering servant bearing the sins of many.
