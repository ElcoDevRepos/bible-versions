The morning is often symbolic of new beginnings or revelations in Scripture. The context here is the day after Jesus cleansed the temple, a significant act that demonstrated His authority and foreshadowed the coming judgment on Israel for their spiritual barrenness. The morning setting also emphasizes the freshness of the disciples' memory of the previous day's events, including Jesus cursing the fig tree.<p><b>they saw the fig tree</b><br>The fig tree is a symbol frequently used in the Bible to represent Israel (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a>). In this context, the fig tree that Jesus cursed the previous day (<a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>) serves as a metaphor for the spiritual state of Israel. Despite its appearance of fruitfulness, it bore no fruit, symbolizing the religious leaders' outward piety but lack of true spiritual fruit. The disciples' observation of the tree highlights the immediate and visible consequences of Jesus' words, underscoring His authority over creation.<p><b>withered from its roots</b><br>The detail that the fig tree withered from its roots is significant. In biblical symbolism, roots often represent the foundation or source of life and strength. The withering from the roots indicates a complete and total judgment, not just a superficial or temporary condition. This serves as a warning of the thoroughness of God's judgment against unfruitfulness and hypocrisy. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of judgment beginning at the root level, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>, where John the Baptist warns that "the axe is already laid at the root of the trees."<br><br>This event is a prophetic act illustrating the fate of those who fail to produce spiritual fruit, aligning with Jesus' teachings on the necessity of bearing fruit in passages like <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>. The withering of the fig tree serves as a type of Christ's judgment, foreshadowing the destruction of the temple and the judgment upon Israel for their rejection of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who previously cursed the fig tree for not bearing fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who witness the withered fig tree and learn from the event.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fig_tree.htm">Fig Tree</a></b><br>A symbol of fruitlessness and judgment, which Jesus cursed the previous day.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city near which this event takes place, significant in Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>The location from which Jesus and His disciples are returning, a place of many significant events in Jesus' life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_bearing_fruit.htm">The Importance of Bearing Fruit</a></b><br>Just as the fig tree was expected to bear fruit, Christians are called to live fruitful lives that reflect their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_accountability.htm">Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>The withering of the fig tree serves as a reminder of God's judgment on unfruitfulness and the importance of living a life that honors Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_prayer.htm">Faith and Prayer</a></b><br>This event underscores the power of faith and the necessity of prayer in the believer's life, as Jesus later teaches His disciples.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_fig_tree.htm">Symbolism of the Fig Tree</a></b><br>The fig tree represents Israel and, by extension, any believer or community that fails to live up to God's expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rootedness_in_christ.htm">Rootedness in Christ</a></b><br>The withering from the roots signifies the importance of being deeply rooted in Christ to sustain spiritual life and growth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_11_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 11:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_20_Faith_s_power_in_life.htm">How does Mark 11:20 demonstrate the power of faith in our lives?

They had returned the evening before, probably after sunset, to Bethany; and so, in the twilight, had not noticed the withered tree. St. Matthew gathers the whole account of the fig tree into one notice. St. Mark disposes of the facts in their chronological order. It was on the Monday morning, the day after the triumphant entry, and when they were on their way to Jerusalem, that our Lord cursed the fig tree. Thence he passed on at once into Jerusalem, and drove out the profaners of the temple, and taught the people. In the evening he returned to Bethany; and then on the next morning, as they were on their way into the city, they saw what had happened to the fig tree. And then <span class="cmt_word">Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him; Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), the same Greek word as in the preceding verse.
