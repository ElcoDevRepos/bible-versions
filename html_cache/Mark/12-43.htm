This act of calling them to Him indicates the importance of what He is about to say. It is a common practice in the Gospels for Jesus to use teachable moments to impart wisdom to His followers. The setting is the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and teaching, which underscores the gravity of His message. By addressing His disciples directly, Jesus ensures that they understand the deeper spiritual truths beyond the surface actions they observe.<p><b>&#8220;Truly I tell you,</b><br>The phrase "Truly I tell you" is a solemn affirmation used by Jesus to emphasize the truth and importance of His statement. In the original Greek, the word "Amen" is used, which conveys certainty and authority. This introduction signals to the disciples that what follows is a profound truth that challenges conventional thinking. It is a call to pay close attention and to understand that Jesus is revealing a divine perspective.<p><b>this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury.</b><br>The "poor widow" represents the marginalized and vulnerable in society, often overlooked and undervalued. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judea, widows were among the most destitute, lacking a male protector or provider. The treasury refers to the collection boxes in the temple where people would deposit their offerings. Jesus contrasts the widow's offering with those of the wealthy, highlighting that her small contribution is of greater value in God's eyes because it was given out of her poverty and with a sacrificial heart. This teaching aligns with the biblical principle that God values the heart and intent behind the gift more than the amount (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also reflects the prophetic call for justice and care for widows and the poor found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>). The widow's act is a type of Christ's own sacrificial giving, as she gives all she has, foreshadowing Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples a lesson about true generosity and the value of sacrificial giving.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are being taught to understand the deeper meaning of giving and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_widow.htm">The Poor Widow</a></b><br>A woman of humble means who gives two small coins, representing her entire livelihood, into the temple treasury.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_treasury.htm">The Treasury</a></b><br>The place in the temple where offerings were collected, often a public area where people could see the contributions being made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jewish people, located in Jerusalem, where this event takes place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_generosity.htm">True Generosity</a></b><br>True generosity is measured by the heart and sacrifice, not by the amount given.

What follows is not opinion but the settled verdict of God.

In <a href="/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13</a>, He is &#8220;moved with compassion&#8221; for another bereaved woman.

She gave more, when she threw in those two mites, than all the others were giving - more, that is, in the estimation of him who sees not as man sees. God does not weigh the gift so much as the mind of the giver. That gift is really the greater in his sight, not which is actually of greater value, but which is greater in respect of the giver. Therefore this poor widow, when she gave her farthing, gave more than they all, because she gave all her living - all, that is, that she had beforehand for that day, trusting that the Lord would give her her bread for that day. And so she carried off the palm for liberality, Christ himself proudly present, but what you offer with being the Judge. St. Ambrose says, "That humility and devotion." which God esteems is not that which you proudly present, but what you offer with humility and devotion. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
