As new wine ferments, it expands, requiring a flexible container. Old wineskins, having already been stretched and dried out, lack the elasticity needed for this process. This metaphor illustrates the incompatibility of Jesus' new teachings with the old Jewish traditions and legalistic practices. The new wine represents the gospel of grace and the kingdom of God, which cannot be contained within the rigid structures of the old covenant. This teaching aligns with the broader theme of transformation and renewal found throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, which speaks of becoming a new creation in Christ.<p><b>If he does, the wine will burst the skins,</b><br>The bursting of the wineskins symbolizes the destructive consequences of trying to fit the new covenant of grace into the old covenant of law. This imagery highlights the futility and danger of attempting to merge the new life in Christ with the old legalistic ways. Historically, this reflects the tension between Jesus and the Pharisees, who were often resistant to His teachings. The bursting signifies the inevitable failure of such an attempt, emphasizing the need for a complete departure from the old system.<p><b>and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.</b><br>This phrase underscores the loss and damage that occur when the new and old are improperly combined. The new wine, representing the gospel, is wasted, and the old wineskins, symbolizing the Jewish law and traditions, are destroyed. This dual ruin serves as a warning against syncretism and the blending of incompatible beliefs. It also points to the necessity of embracing the new covenant fully, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>, which speaks of the old covenant becoming obsolete.<p><b>Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.&#8221;</b><br>The conclusion of this teaching emphasizes the need for a new framework to accommodate the new message of Jesus. New wineskins represent the renewed hearts and minds of believers who are receptive to the transformative power of the gospel. This transformation is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which calls for the renewal of the mind. The new wineskins also symbolize the church, the body of Christ, which is built on the foundation of grace and truth. This teaching encourages believers to embrace the new life offered through Christ, leaving behind the constraints of the old covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this metaphor to teach about the newness of His message and the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_of_john_and_pharisees.htm">Disciples of John and Pharisees</a></b><br>The context of this teaching involves a question about fasting, posed by the disciples of John and the Pharisees, who represent the old religious order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wineskins.htm">Wineskins</a></b><br>A common item in ancient times used to store wine, made from animal skins.

The sense is this: New wine, in the process of fermentation, will burst old bottles made of wine-skins not strong enough to resist the strength of the fermenting fluid; so that there is a twofold loss - both that of the bottles and that of the wine. And therefore new wine must be poured into bottles made of fresh wine-skins, which, by reason of their strength and toughness, shall be able to resist the fermenting energy of the new wine. And by these very apt illustrations our Lord teaches us that it is a vain thing to attempt to mingle together the spiritual freedom of the gospel with the old ceremonies of the Law. To attempt to engraft the living spiritual energy of the gospel upon the old legal ceremonial now about to pass away, would be as fatal a thing as to piece an old garment with new material, or to put new wine into old wineskins. There is here, therefore, a valuable lesson for the Christian Church, namely, to treat new converts with gentleness and consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">no one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(oudeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3762.htm">Strong's 3762: </a> </span><span class="str2">No one, none, nothing. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">pours</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ballei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_906.htm">Strong's 906: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I cast, throw, rush, (b) often, in the weaker sense: I place, put, drop.
