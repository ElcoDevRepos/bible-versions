In the context of the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus takes charge, demonstrating His authority and compassion. This directive is a precursor to the miracle, showing His intention to provide for the people's needs. It reflects the order and structure that Jesus often brings to situations, reminiscent of God&#8217;s orderly creation in Genesis.<p><b>to have the people sit</b><br>The act of sitting indicates preparation for receiving something, in this case, a meal. It also suggests a posture of rest and expectation. In Jewish culture, sitting was a common posture for teaching, indicating that the people were about to receive not just physical nourishment but also spiritual teaching. This mirrors the way Jesus often taught His disciples and the crowds.<p><b>in groups</b><br>Organizing the people into groups suggests a sense of community and order. This method of organization would facilitate the distribution of food, ensuring that everyone was served. It reflects the communal nature of the early church as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where believers shared everything in common. This grouping also foreshadows the structure of the church, where believers gather in communities.<p><b>on the green grass</b><br>The mention of green grass is significant, indicating the time of year as spring, around Passover. This detail connects to <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where the Good Shepherd makes His sheep lie down in green pastures, symbolizing provision and peace. The lush grass also contrasts with the wilderness setting, emphasizing the miraculous provision in a place where resources were scarce. This imagery reinforces Jesus as the Shepherd who provides for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of feeding the 5,000.

It would not be green in that district after April. Thus St. Mark's account of the state of the grass at that time (an account evidently repeated from an eye-witness) coincides with the account of St. John, who says that "the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand" (<a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] directed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epetaxen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2004.htm">Strong's 2004: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give order, command, charge.
