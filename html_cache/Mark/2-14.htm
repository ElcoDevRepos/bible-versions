Jesus frequently traveled through towns and villages, teaching and performing miracles. His itinerant lifestyle reflects the urgency and outreach of His mission, as seen in other passages like <a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>.<p><b>He saw Levi son of Alphaeus</b><br>Levi, also known as Matthew, is identified as the son of Alphaeus. This name is significant as it connects him to a specific family lineage, though not much is known about Alphaeus. Levi's other name, Matthew, is more commonly used in the Gospel of Matthew, where he is listed among the twelve apostles (<a href="/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>). The dual name may indicate a transformation or new identity in Christ, similar to Simon Peter.<p><b>sitting at the tax booth</b><br>Tax booths were common in Roman-occupied territories, where tax collectors gathered tolls and taxes. Levi's position as a tax collector would have made him unpopular among the Jewish people, as tax collectors were often seen as collaborators with the Roman authorities and were notorious for extortion. This context highlights the radical nature of Jesus' call, as He reaches out to those marginalized by society.<p><b>&#8220;Follow Me,&#8221; He told him</b><br>Jesus' invitation to "Follow Me" is a direct call to discipleship. This command is central to Jesus' ministry, as He calls individuals to leave their former lives and commit to His teachings and mission. The call to follow is not just physical but spiritual, requiring a transformation of heart and priorities. This phrase echoes similar calls to other disciples, such as Peter and Andrew in <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>.<p><b>and Levi got up and followed Him</b><br>Levi's immediate response demonstrates his willingness to leave his lucrative position and social status to follow Jesus. This act of obedience and faith is significant, as it shows the power of Jesus' call and the transformative impact it has on individuals. Levi's decision to follow Jesus is a testament to the compelling nature of Christ's presence and message, paralleling the responses of other disciples who left everything to follow Him (<a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who calls Levi to follow Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi (Matthew)</a></b><br>Also known as Matthew, he is a tax collector, a profession often despised by the Jewish people for its association with Roman oppression and corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/alphaeus.htm">Alphaeus</a></b><br>The father of Levi, mentioned to identify Levi's lineage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tax_booth.htm">Tax Booth</a></b><br>The place where Levi was working when Jesus called him.

This teaches us the importance of responding promptly to God's call in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leaving_the_old_life_behind.htm">Leaving the Old Life Behind</a></b><br>Levi leaves his tax booth, symbolizing a departure from his old life.
