Their role was not only religious but also political, as they maintained a delicate balance of power with the Roman authorities. Their involvement in Jesus' trial highlights the tension between Jesus' teachings and the established religious order.<br><br>Began to accuse Him: The accusations against Jesus were part of a premeditated plan to eliminate Him as a threat to their authority. The chief priests had previously plotted to kill Jesus (<a href="/mark/14.htm">Mark 14:1</a>) and now sought to present charges that would warrant Roman intervention. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is oppressed and afflicted yet does not open His mouth in defense.<br><br>Of many things: The accusations were numerous and likely included claims of blasphemy, misleading the nation, forbidding tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be a king (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). These charges were designed to portray Jesus as a political insurgent, a threat to Roman rule, and a blasphemer against Jewish law.

This small conjunction ties the verse to the scene that has just unfolded in Pilate&#8217;s court (<a href="/mark/15-1.htm">Mark 15:1-2</a>), showing the rapid progression from the religious trial to the civil one.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;and&#8221; to signal escalating opposition to Christ, such as in <a href="/luke/22-63.htm">Luke 22:63-71</a>, where abuse follows interrogation.<p>&#8226; The continuous narrative underscores God&#8217;s sovereign plan moving forward without pause (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the chief priests</b><p>&#8226;

Their leadership in hostility fulfills Jesus&#8217; prediction that He would be rejected by &#8220;the chief priests and the teachers of the law&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence before Pilate echoes an earlier conspiracy (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>), revealing the deep-seated intent to eliminate Jesus rather than seek truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>began to accuse</b><p>&#8226; The verb shows determined, ongoing action: they are not merely presenting facts but launching a barrage of charges (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; False testimony had already been marshaled in the Sanhedrin (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>), and now those fabrications are repackaged for Roman ears.<p>&#8226; The pattern aligns with <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>: &#8220;Malicious witnesses rise up; they question me about things I do not know.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By accusing instead of worshiping, they invert their God-given role, illustrating <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>&#8212;calling evil good and good evil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Him&#8221; points unmistakably to Jesus, the sinless Son of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Though standing silent, He embodies the Lamb led to slaughter (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="/mark/15-5.htm">Mark 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s later statement, &#8220;I find no fault in this man&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>), highlights the stark contrast between human accusation and divine innocence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of many things</b><p>&#8226;

Multiple fabricated charges also fulfill prophecy that Messiah would be &#8220;despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Matthew notes they sought &#8220;false testimony&#8230;so that they could put Him to death&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-60</a>), exposing their motives.<p>&#8226; Their strategy collapses under its own weight, for diverse lies cannot mask the singular truth of Christ&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3</a> reveals a calculated, escalating assault by Israel&#8217;s religious elite against their promised Messiah. The chief priests, intended to represent God&#8217;s justice, instead unleash a torrent of false charges, fulfilling prophecy and showcasing the contrast between human corruption and the Lord&#8217;s flawless integrity. Their many accusations cannot tarnish His innocence; rather, they advance the divine purpose of the cross, where Jesus will bear not merely human slander but the full penalty for sin&#8212;demonstrating both the tragedy of blind religion and the triumph of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">But he answered</span> <span class= "bld">nothing.</span>--Many MSS. omit these words, but the fact is implied in Pilate's question, and in "Jesus yet answered nothing," in <a href="/mark/15-5.htm" title="But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.">Mark 15:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the chief priests accused him of many things</span>.

But they are to be found in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12</a>); and Pilate's question in the next verse confirms St. Matthew's statement, and makes the sentence unnecessary here. Our Lord answered nothing, because all that they had to say against him was manifestly false or frivolous, and unworthy of any reply.
