In the context of <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, Jesus is speaking about the end times and the great distress that will occur. The "days" likely refer to a time of judgment and upheaval, possibly linked to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 or a future eschatological event. The idea of God intervening to limit the duration of suffering is consistent with His character of mercy and compassion, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8-9</a>, where God preserves a remnant for His purposes.<p><b>nobody would be saved</b><br>This highlights the severity of the tribulation, suggesting that without divine intervention, the destruction would be total. The term "saved" here can be understood both in a physical sense&#8212;preservation of life&#8212;and a spiritual sense&#8212;salvation from eternal judgment. This duality is seen throughout scripture, where physical deliverance often symbolizes spiritual salvation, as in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>).<p><b>But for the sake of the elect</b><br>The "elect" refers to those chosen by God, a concept found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a> and <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>. This group is set apart for God's purposes and is often associated with the faithful remnant who remain true to God amidst widespread apostasy. The preservation of the elect underscores God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His sovereign choice.<p><b>whom He has chosen</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty in salvation, aligning with passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, which speak of God's predestining work. The concept of divine election is a recurring theme in scripture, highlighting that salvation is initiated by God and not based on human merit. This choice is rooted in God's grace and purpose, ensuring that His plans are fulfilled.<p><b>He has cut them short</b><br>God's intervention to shorten the days of tribulation is an act of mercy, ensuring the survival of the elect. This divine action reflects God's control over history and His ability to alter events for the sake of His people. It also serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over time and circumstances, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to God, who exercises sovereign control over the events of history and the timing of the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elect.htm">The Elect</a></b><br>Those chosen by God for salvation, highlighting the doctrine of election and God's special care for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_days.htm">The Days</a></b><br>Refers to a period of great tribulation and distress, a time of intense suffering and trial.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The deliverance from sin and its consequences, ultimately leading to eternal life with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribulation.htm">Tribulation</a></b><br>A future period of severe trial and suffering, often associated with the end times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the future.

If the time of the siege of Jerusalem had lasted much longer, not one of the nation could have survived; all would have perished by war, or famine, or pestilence. The Romans raged against the Jews as an obstinate and rebellious nation, and would have exterminated them. But "the Lord" shortened the time of this frightful catastrophe, for the elect's sake, that is, partly for the sake of the Christians who could not escape from Jerusalem, and partly for that of the Jews, who, subdued by this awful visitation, were converted to Christ or would hereafter be converted to him We learn from hence how great is the love of God towards his elect, and his care for them. For their sakes he spared many Jews. For their sakes he created and preserves the whole world. Yea, for their sakes, Christ the eternal Son was made man, and became obedient unto death. "All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is <span class="accented">God's."</span> It may be added that a number of providential circumstances combined to shorten these days of terror. Titus was himself disposed to clemency, and friendly towards Josephus. Moreover, he was attached to Bernice, a Jewess, the sister of Agrippa. All these and other circumstances conspired in the providence of God to "shorten the days." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
