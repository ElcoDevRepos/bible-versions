Their father, Zebedee, was a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee, indicating a background of modest means.

It echoes the cultural norms of the time, where positions of authority were sought after for personal gain. Their request also parallels the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where Satan offered Him all the kingdoms of the world (<a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8-9</a>).

The two accounts are readily reconciled if we consider that the request was made by Salome and her sons, and by her in their behalf. This request was made by them not long after they had heard our Lord's great promise that his apostles "in the regeneration" should "sit upon thrones," judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). He and very soon after they had heard his repeated announcement of his sufferings and death. But the thought of the glory which was to follow swallowed up the thought of the suffering that was to precede it; and so these two disciples were emboldened at once to ask for prominent positions amongst the thrones. St. Chrysostom finds an excuse for the imperfection of their faith. He says, "The mystery of the cross was not yet accomplished; nor yet was the grace of the Holy Spirit poured into their hearts. Wherefore, if you desire to know the strength of their faith, consider what they became after they had been endued with power from on high." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">James</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Iak&#333;bos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2385.htm">Strong's 2385: </a> </span><span class="str2">The same as Iakob Graecized; Jacobus, the name of three Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">John,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
