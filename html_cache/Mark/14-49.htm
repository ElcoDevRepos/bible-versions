His daily teaching underscores His dedication to His mission and His accessibility to the public. It reflects the pattern of His ministry, which was open and transparent, contrasting with the secretive actions of His arresters. This also emphasizes His fulfillment of the role of a rabbi, who would regularly teach in public spaces.<p><b>teaching in the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were central to Jewish religious life, serving as a place for teaching, worship, and gathering. Jesus' teaching in this location signifies His authority and His challenge to the religious leaders of the time. The temple was not only a religious center but also a cultural and social hub, making it a strategic place for Jesus to reach a wide audience. His presence there fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speaks of the Lord coming to His temple.<p><b>and you did not arrest Me</b><br>This phrase points to the inconsistency and cowardice of the religious leaders. Despite having ample opportunity to arrest Jesus publicly, they refrained, likely due to fear of the people's reaction (<a href="/mark/12-12.htm">Mark 12:12</a>). This highlights the leaders' awareness of Jesus' popularity and the potential for public unrest. It also underscores the fulfillment of God's timing, as Jesus' arrest and crucifixion were to occur according to divine plan, not human scheming.<p><b>But this has happened that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.</b><br>This statement affirms the divine orchestration of events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which foretold the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. Jesus' reference to the fulfillment of Scripture emphasizes His role as the prophesied Savior and the inevitability of God's redemptive plan.
