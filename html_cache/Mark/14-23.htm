The "cup" here is significant as it represents the new covenant in Jesus' blood, a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. The act of taking the cup is symbolic of Jesus' acceptance of His impending sacrifice.<p><b>gave thanks</b><br>The act of giving thanks, or "Eucharisteo" in Greek, is where the term "Eucharist" originates. This reflects Jesus' gratitude to the Father, even in the face of suffering. It also sets a precedent for believers to approach the Lord's Table with thanksgiving, acknowledging the grace and sacrifice of Christ.<p><b>and gave it to them</b><br>Jesus distributing the cup to His disciples signifies the sharing of His life and sacrifice with His followers.

It also prefigures the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to all believers.<p><b>and they all drank from it</b><br>The disciples' participation in drinking from the cup symbolizes their acceptance of the new covenant and their unity with Christ. This act is a precursor to the Christian practice of communion, where believers partake in the body and blood of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm">1 Corinthians 11:25-26</a>.
