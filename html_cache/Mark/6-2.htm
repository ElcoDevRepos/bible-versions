It was customary for Jews to gather in synagogues for prayer and teaching. Jesus often used the Sabbath as an opportunity to teach, emphasizing the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in Himself (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>He began to teach in the synagogue</b><br>Synagogues were central to Jewish community life, serving as places of worship, education, and legal proceedings. Jesus teaching in the synagogue aligns with His role as a rabbi or teacher, a respected position in Jewish society. His teaching often challenged traditional interpretations, emphasizing the spirit rather than the letter of the Law (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p><b>and many who heard Him were astonished</b><br>The astonishment of the listeners reflects the authority and wisdom with which Jesus spoke, distinguishing Him from other teachers of the Law. This reaction is consistent with other accounts of Jesus' teaching, where His insights and understanding of Scripture left audiences amazed (<a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Where did this man get these ideas?&#8221; they asked</b><br>The question highlights the perceived incongruity between Jesus' humble origins and His profound teaching. Jesus, known as the carpenter's son from Nazareth, did not have formal rabbinical training, which puzzled those who heard Him (<a href="/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;What is this wisdom He has been given?</b><br>The wisdom of Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospels, often linked to His divine nature and mission. This wisdom is seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of wisdom resting upon Him.<p><b>And how can He perform such miracles?</b><br>The miracles of Jesus served as signs of His divine authority and the inauguration of God's Kingdom on earth. They fulfilled prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which describe the miraculous works of the coming Messiah. The people's amazement at His miracles underscores their recognition of something extraordinary, yet they struggled to reconcile this with their expectations of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, teaching in the synagogue with wisdom and performing miracles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>A place of Jewish worship and teaching, where Jesus often taught.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>The Jewish day of rest and worship, significant for communal gatherings and teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present in the synagogue who were astonished by Jesus' teachings and miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>Jesus' hometown, where this event takes place, and where familiarity breeds skepticism.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_jesus'_teaching.htm">The Authority of Jesus' Teaching</a></b><br>Jesus' wisdom and authority come from God, not human institutions.
