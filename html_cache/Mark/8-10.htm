The immediacy suggests a deliberate transition from the previous event, which was the feeding of the 4,000. Jesus often used boats to travel across the Sea of Galilee, a central location in His ministry. The Sea of Galilee was a hub for fishing and trade, making it a strategic location for spreading His message. The presence of His disciples emphasizes their role as witnesses and participants in His ministry, learning directly from His teachings and actions.<p><b>and went to the district of Dalmanutha</b><br>Dalmanutha is mentioned only in this passage, and its exact location is uncertain. Some scholars suggest it may be near Magdala, on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. This area was part of the region where Jesus performed many miracles and teachings. The movement to Dalmanutha signifies Jesus' continued mission to reach different communities. The journey reflects the itinerant nature of His ministry, fulfilling the prophecy of being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This movement also sets the stage for the subsequent interactions with the Pharisees, highlighting the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/boat.htm">Boat</a></b><br>A common mode of transportation for Jesus and His disciples, often used to travel across the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/district_of_dalmanutha.htm">District of Dalmanutha</a></b><br>A region mentioned in the New Testament, its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the Sea of Galilee.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_trust.htm">Obedience and Trust</a></b><br>Jesus' disciples followed Him into the boat without question, demonstrating trust and obedience.
