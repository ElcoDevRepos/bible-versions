they did not debate or delay.<p>&#8226; Such ready obedience echoes earlier models: Abraham leaving at God&#8217;s word (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), the servants filling waterpots at Cana (<a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a>), and the disciples preparing the Passover exactly as told (<a href="/mark/14-16.htm">Mark 14:16</a>).<p>&#8226;
