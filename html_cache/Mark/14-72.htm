In the cultural context of first-century Judea, roosters were common, and their crowing marked the early morning hours. This specific timing underscores the immediacy and accuracy of Jesus' prediction. The second crowing serves as a divine reminder to Peter of his earlier conversation with Jesus, highlighting the precision of Jesus' foreknowledge.<p><b>Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him:</b><br>Peter's recollection of Jesus' words is significant as it marks a moment of realization and conviction. In the biblical narrative, memory often serves as a catalyst for repentance and transformation. This moment is pivotal for Peter, as it brings to mind Jesus' earlier warning during the Last Supper (<a href="/mark/14-30.htm">Mark 14:30</a>). The act of remembering is not just cognitive but deeply spiritual, prompting Peter to confront his failure.<p><b>&#8220;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy by Jesus is a direct prediction of Peter's denial, emphasizing the foreknowledge and sovereignty of Christ. The specificity of the prophecy&#8212;mentioning both the rooster's crowing and the number of denials&#8212;demonstrates Jesus' understanding of human frailty. The number three in biblical terms often signifies completeness or emphasis, underscoring the gravity of Peter's denial. This event fulfills Jesus' words and serves as a humbling lesson for Peter, who had previously declared his unwavering loyalty.<p><b>And he broke down and wept.</b><br>Peter's emotional response is one of deep remorse and repentance. The act of weeping indicates a profound sense of sorrow and regret for his actions. In the cultural context, public weeping was a common expression of grief and penitence. This moment is crucial for Peter's spiritual journey, as it marks the beginning of his restoration. His tears reflect a genuine contrition, setting the stage for his eventual reinstatement by Jesus after the resurrection (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-19</a>).

The English version assumes that it means "casting his mind or thoughts," just as "to reflect" is "to bend the mind," and is probably right. The marginal readings give two conjectures.
