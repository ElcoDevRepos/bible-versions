This gathering indicates a formal response to their accusations, emphasizing the importance of His teaching. Jesus often used gatherings to teach and correct misunderstandings, as seen in other instances like the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7).<p><b>and began to speak to them in parables:</b><br>Parables are a hallmark of Jesus' teaching method, using simple stories to convey profound spiritual truths. They were accessible to those open to understanding but concealed from those who were hard-hearted. This method fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, "I will open my mouth in a parable." Parables also served to challenge the listeners to think deeply and reflect on their spiritual condition.<p><b>&#8220;How can Satan drive out Satan?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the absurdity of the accusation that Jesus was casting out demons by Satan's power. It underscores the logical inconsistency in the scribes' claim, as a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand (<a href="/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24</a>). This statement also points to the spiritual warfare theme present throughout the Gospels, where Jesus' authority over demons demonstrates His divine power and the coming of God's kingdom. The question invites the audience to consider the true source of Jesus' power, aligning with His mission to destroy the works of the devil (1 <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the accusations made against Him by the scribes.

But then he goes on to show that if this their allegation were true, namely, that he cast out devils by the prince or the devils, then it would follow that Satan's kingdom would be divided against itself. As a house divided against itself cannot stand, so neither could the kingdom of Satan exist in the world if one evil spirit was opposed to another for the purpose of dispossessing, the one the other, from the minds and bodies of men. Our Lord thus employs another argument to show that he casts out evil spirits, not by Beelzebub, but by the power of God. It is as though he said, "As he who invades the house of a strong man cannot succeed until he first binds the strong man; in like manner I, Christ Jesus, who spoil the kingdom of Satan, whilst I lead sinners who had been under his power to repentance and salvation, must first bind Satan himself, otherwise he would never suffer me to take his captives from him. Therefore he is my enemy, and not in league with me, not my ally in the casting out of evil spirits, as you falsely represent me to be. It behoves you, then, to understand that it is with the Spirit of God that I cast out devils, and that therefore the kingdom of God is come upon you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] called them together</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
