This ability to discern hearts is consistent with His nature as God (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The Pharisees and Herodians, typically adversaries, unite in their opposition to Jesus, highlighting the threat He posed to their authority. Their hypocrisy is evident as they pretend to seek His wisdom while intending to trap Him.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Why are you testing Me?</b><br>Jesus directly addresses their deceitful intentions, exposing their attempt to ensnare Him. This question echoes the testing of God by the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>), where testing God was seen as a lack of faith. Jesus, aware of their malice, challenges their motives, emphasizing His role as the true teacher and authority.<p><b>Bring Me a denarius to inspect.&#8221;</b><br>The denarius was a Roman coin, commonly used in Jesus' time, bearing the image of the emperor. This request sets the stage for His teaching on the relationship between civic duty and spiritual allegiance. The coin's image and inscription would have been familiar to His audience, symbolizing Roman authority and the political tension of the period. Jesus uses this moment to illustrate a deeper truth about the kingdom of God versus earthly kingdoms, foreshadowing His teaching on rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tested by the Pharisees and Herodians.

Jesus instantly recognized the sham&#8212;just as He &#8220;knew what was in a man&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>) and discerned the thoughts of the scribes (<a href="/luke/5-22.htm">Luke 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often exposes religious pretense. Isaiah spoke of people who drew near with lips while their hearts were far away (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). Jesus labeled that attitude &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; again in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>.<p>&#8226; His ability to see straight to the heart fulfills &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>) and echoes God&#8217;s word to Samuel: &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By unveiling their duplicity, Jesus shows that He is the righteous Judge (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>) and underscores that motives matter as much as words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why are you testing Me?</b><p>&#8220;Why are you testing Me?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-15.htm">Mark 12:15</a>b)<p>&#8226; The question exposes their sin. Testing God is a pattern Israel was warned against: &#8220;You shall not test the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, reflecting <a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Satan tried the same tactic in the wilderness, and Jesus replied, &#8220;You shall not test the Lord your God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-7.htm">Matthew 4:7</a>). By repeating the warning here, He equates Himself with the Lord who must not be tested.<p>&#8226; Their test was strategic. If Jesus rejected the tax, Rome could charge Him with sedition; if He endorsed it, nationalists could accuse Him of disloyalty. Luke&#8217;s parallel notes they &#8220;watched closely and sent spies&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s counter-question flips the spotlight from His allegiance to their intentions, recalling how He often answered questions with questions (<a href="/mark/11-30.htm">Mark 11:30</a>; <a href="/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a>) to uncover hearts rather than merely win debates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring Me a denarius to inspect</b><p>&#8220;Bring Me a denarius to inspect.&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-15.htm">Mark 12:15</a>c)<p>&#8226; A denarius was the standard day&#8217;s wage (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>) and bore the image of Tiberius Caesar. By asking for the coin, Jesus forces His challengers to produce the very symbol of Roman authority&#8212;an object they already carry and use.<p>&#8226; This simple request sets up His famous conclusion, &#8220;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-17.htm">Mark 12:17</a>). The object lesson is visual, memorable, and unanswerable.<p>&#8226; The tactic echoes Old Testament prophets who used physical items to illustrate truth&#8212;Jeremiah&#8217;s yoke (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>) or Ezekiel&#8217;s tile (<a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Handling the coin also exposes their inconsistency: they recoil at paying tax yet comfortably possess Caesar&#8217;s money. <a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a> reminds, &#8220;Honest scales and balances belong to the LORD; all the weights in the bag are His work,&#8221; pointing to God&#8217;s sovereignty over every economy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a> later applies the principle: &#8220;Pay everyone what you owe him&#8230;taxes to whom taxes are due,&#8221; yet always with ultimate allegiance to God (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-15.htm">Mark 12:15</a> highlights Jesus&#8217; flawless discernment, His rejection of hypocritical testing, and His masterful use of a common coin to expose false motives while preparing to teach about rightful allegiance. The verse reassures believers that Christ sees through every facade, confronts sin directly, and guides His people to honor earthly authorities without compromising wholehearted devotion to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But he, knowing their hypocrisy.</span>--St. Mark uses the specific word that describes the sin of the questioners, instead of the more general "wickedness" of St. Matthew. On the other hand, he omits the word "hypocrites" as applied to them by our Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-18.htm">Matthew 22:18</a>) says, "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?' You pretend that you are approaching me with a good conscience, sincerely desirous to know how you ought to act in this matter; when at the same time you are enemies alike of me and of God, and are thirsting for my blood, and are doing all in your power to torment me, and to entangle me by fraud. "The first virtue," says St. Jerome, "of the respondent is to know the mind of the questioner, and to adapt his answer accordingly." These Pharisees and Heredians flatter Christ that they may destroy him; but he rebukes them, that, if possible, be might save them. <span class="cmt_word">Bring me a penny, that I may see it</span>. The Roman denarius was equal to about eight-pence halfpenny. This was the coin in which the tribute money was to be paid. It had stamped upon it the image of Tiberius Caesar, the then reigning Roman emperor. The cognomen of Caesar was first given to Julius Caesar, from whom it was devolved to his successors. The current coin of the country proved the subjection of the country to him whose image was upon it. Maimonides, quoted by Dr. John Lightfoot (vol. 2 p. 230), says, "Wheresoever the money of any king is current, there the inhabitants acknowledge that king for their lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] saw through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eid&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
