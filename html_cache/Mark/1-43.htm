The Greek word used here for "promptly" suggests a sense of immediacy and determination. This reflects Jesus' authoritative nature and His control over the situation. In the context of <a href="/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>, Jesus had just healed a man with leprosy, a disease that rendered individuals ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (Leviticus 13-14). By sending the man away quickly, Jesus was ensuring that the man would follow the necessary steps to be reintegrated into society, as prescribed by the law. This action also highlights Jesus' respect for the Mosaic Law, even as He demonstrates His power over physical ailments.<p><b>with a stern warning:</b><br>The stern warning given by Jesus underscores the seriousness of the instructions He was about to give. The Greek term used here can imply a strong emotional charge, suggesting that Jesus was deeply concerned about the man's compliance. This warning was likely related to the instructions for the man to show himself to the priest and offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses for his cleansing (<a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>). This was important not only for the man's reintegration into the community but also as a testimony to the priests of Jesus' authority and fulfillment of the law. The warning also serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to Jesus' commands, a theme that runs throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle and gives the stern warning.
