In Jewish law, the testimony of two or more witnesses was required to establish a fact (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, sought to find evidence against Jesus to justify His execution. However, the witnesses could not provide consistent testimony, highlighting the lack of legitimate evidence against Him. This reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, where David speaks of false witnesses rising against him, a type of Christ's own experience.<p><b>was inconsistent.</b><br>The inconsistency of the testimony underscores the unjust nature of the trial. The false witnesses could not agree on their accusations, which should have invalidated their testimony according to Jewish law. This inconsistency is significant because it demonstrates the innocence of Jesus and the lengths to which the religious leaders went to condemn Him. The failure to produce consistent testimony fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is oppressed and afflicted, yet remains silent before His accusers. This moment also prefigures the ultimate truth of Christ's resurrection, which would stand in stark contrast to the falsehoods presented at His trial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is on trial before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council responsible for religious and legal matters.

The Sanhedrin had already entertained several false witnesses against Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55&#8211;58</a>), yet the verse draws attention to a turning point: something is about to be exposed. Scripture often uses &#8220;but&#8221; to highlight God&#8217;s overruling of human schemes, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a> when Joseph says, &#8220;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.&#8221; In the same way, the plans of the religious leaders were about to unravel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even</b><p>The word &#8220;even&#8221; intensifies the statement, underscoring the depth of failure in the witness reports. Though the leaders had assembled many accusers (<a href="/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>), &#8220;even&#8221; those witnesses&#8212;handpicked for a guilty verdict&#8212;could not present a coherent case. <a href="/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13</a> shows a similar tactic later used against Stephen, reminding readers that God exposes dishonesty despite human efforts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their testimony</b><p>Testimony held legal weight in Jewish courts, and Mosaic Law required &#8220;two or three witnesses&#8221; to agree (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The Sanhedrin sought this unanimity, yet &#8220;their testimony&#8221; stood on shaky ground. <a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a> forbids bearing false witness, a command now flagrantly violated. The scene spotlights how human testimony fails when driven by malice rather than truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was inconsistent</b><p>The core issue: none of the statements lined up. <a href="/mark/14-59.htm">Mark 14:59</a> declares, &#8220;But even their testimony was inconsistent.&#8221; Contradictions broke the legal case apart, echoing <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a> where David pleads, &#8220;Do not hand me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.&#8221; Jesus faces the same reality, yet the inconsistency of the accusers validates His innocence. Still, the leaders press on, illustrating <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>: &#8220;He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth,&#8221; showing the silent endurance of the true Lamb of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/14-59.htm">Mark 14:59</a> reveals that despite determined efforts, the Sanhedrin could not secure the agreement required by God&#8217;s Law, exposing the hollowness of their case. The contrast (&#8220;But&#8221;), the emphasis (&#8220;even&#8221;), the legal framework (&#8220;their testimony&#8221;), and the final verdict (&#8220;was inconsistent&#8221;) combine to show God&#8217;s sovereign protection of truth and the fulfilment of prophecy, even as Jesus willingly walks the path to the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(59) <span class= "bld">Neither so did their witness</span> <span class= "bld">agree together.</span>--This, again, is peculiar to St. Mark.
