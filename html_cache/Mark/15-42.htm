Evening in Jewish reckoning begins at sunset, marking the end of one day and the beginning of the next. This detail indicates that Jesus' crucifixion occurred on the day of preparation, and His body needed to be taken down before the Sabbath began at sunset. The urgency to bury Jesus before the Sabbath reflects Jewish customs and laws regarding work and rest on the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>).<p><b>Since it was Preparation Day</b><br>Preparation Day refers to the day before the Sabbath, a time when Jews would prepare meals and complete tasks forbidden on the Sabbath. This day was particularly significant during Passover week, as it was a time of heightened religious observance. The mention of Preparation Day underscores the importance of adhering to Jewish law, even amidst the extraordinary events of Jesus' death. It also highlights the fulfillment of Jesus as the Passover Lamb, as His crucifixion coincides with the preparation for Passover (<a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>).<p><b>(that is, the day before the Sabbath),</b><br>The clarification that Preparation Day is the day before the Sabbath emphasizes the immediacy of the situation. The Sabbath, a day of rest instituted by God (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>), was strictly observed, and no work, including burial, could be performed. This context explains the haste in which Joseph of Arimathea sought to bury Jesus (<a href="/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>). The timing also aligns with the prophecy of Jesus being in the grave for three days and three nights (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>), as His burial before the Sabbath allowed for this timeline to be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>This refers to the time of day, specifically the period after sunset. In Jewish tradition, the day begins at sunset, so this marks the transition from one day to the next.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_day.htm">Preparation Day</a></b><br>This is the day before the Sabbath, a time when Jews would prepare for the Sabbath by completing tasks that could not be done on the Sabbath itself. It is significant because it sets the context for the urgency in the burial of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is a day of rest observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening.

By the time His body hung lifeless, &#8220;evening&#8221; had set in, signaling the close of that same day (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law required a body not remain on a tree overnight (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>), so the approach of nightfall put urgency on removing Jesus from the cross.<p>&#8226; The moment underscores fulfilled prophecy: His suffering ended exactly within the limits set by Scripture, highlighting the Father&#8217;s perfect timing (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God works on a precise timetable.
