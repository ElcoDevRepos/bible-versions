This encounter is set in the context of increasing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of His time. Jesus' response demonstrates His wisdom and authority, often leaving His challengers without a rebuttal.<p><b>&#8220;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&#8217;s</b><br>The mention of "Caesar" refers to the Roman Emperor, under whose rule Judea was a province. The Roman Empire imposed taxes on its subjects, which was a point of contention among the Jewish people, who resented Roman occupation. By stating this, Jesus acknowledges the legitimacy of secular authority and the obligation to fulfill civic duties. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical principle of respecting governing authorities, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, where Paul instructs believers to submit to governing authorities as they are established by God.<p><b>and to God what is God&#8217;s.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the statement emphasizes the higher obligation to God, which transcends earthly authorities. It implies that while civic duties are important, spiritual obligations are paramount. This dual responsibility highlights the distinction between earthly and divine realms. The phrase calls believers to recognize God's sovereignty over all aspects of life, including those that belong to Him, such as worship, obedience, and moral conduct. This echoes the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which commands love and devotion to God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>And they marveled at Him.</b><br>The reaction of marveling indicates that Jesus' answer was unexpected and profound, leaving His questioners without a means to trap Him. This response showcases Jesus' unparalleled wisdom and ability to navigate complex social and political issues. The amazement of the crowd and His opponents is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' teachings and actions often leave onlookers in awe, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds are astonished at His teaching because He taught with authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question designed to trap Him.

Jesus&#8217; answer dissolves a political trap, honors civil order, and exalts divine sovereignty&#8212;all in one sentence that still leaves listeners marveling today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's</span>. It is as though our Lord said, "Since you Jews are now subject to Caesar - and there is here this evidence of it, that his coin is current amongst you; you would not use it were you not obliged, because all Gentile rites and symbols are an abhorrence to you; - but since Caesar demands nothing of you but his tribute - the coin stamped with his own image and name - it is your duty to render to him his own denarius for tribute. But spiritual things, such as worship and obedience, give these to God; for these he demands from you as his right, and by so doing you will offend neither God nor yet Caesar." Our Lord, in his infinite wisdom, avoids the question altogether whether the Jews were rightly in subjection to the Romans. This was a doubtful question. But there could be no doubt as to the fact that they were tributary. This was made plain by the evidence of the current coin. Now, this being so, it was manifestly the duty of the Jewish people to give to Caesar the tribute money which he demanded of them for the expenses of government, and especially of supporting an army to defend them from their enemies. And it was no less their duty to give their tribute to God, which he in his own right demanded of them as his creatures and faithful subjects. The rights of Caesar are one thing, and those of God are another; and there is nothing that need clash between them. State polity is not opposed to religion, nor religion to state. Tertullian says, "'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's;' that is, give to Caesar his image stamped upon his coin, and give to God his own image stamped upon you; so that while you render to Caesar the coin which is his due, you may render your own self to God." This wonderful answer of our Lord teaches us that we ought to try to speak so wisely, and so to moderato our speech amongst those who are captious, that we may, if possible, offend neither side, but steer safely between Scylla and Charybdis. <span class="cmt_word">And they marvelled at him</span>.

He vaulted over the trap set for him, leaving them entangled in it.
