In this context, the fig tree in leaf suggests the appearance of fruitfulness. Geographically, fig trees were common in the region, and their leaves would typically indicate the presence of fruit. This scene sets the stage for a lesson on spiritual fruitfulness and hypocrisy.<p><b>He went to see if there was any fruit on it</b><br>Jesus' approach to the fig tree is an acted parable. The expectation of finding fruit despite the season highlights the importance of genuine spiritual productivity. This action parallels Jesus' search for true faith and righteousness among the people of Israel, who outwardly appeared devout but often lacked true spiritual fruit.<p><b>But when He reached it, He found nothing on it except leaves</b><br>The absence of fruit despite the presence of leaves serves as a metaphor for religious pretense without true devotion. This reflects the condition of many religious leaders of the time, who maintained an outward appearance of piety but lacked genuine faith and obedience (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><b>since it was not the season for figs</b><br>This phrase underscores the unexpected nature of Jesus' action. While it was not the typical time for figs, the presence of leaves suggested the possibility of early fruit. This highlights the urgency of being spiritually prepared at all times, as Jesus often taught about readiness for the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>).

The fig season had not come, and therefore the fruit, if any had been borne, would not have been gathered. There is nothing, however, against taking the words in their more natural sequence. The precocious foliage had suggested the thought that some of the early ripe figs might be already formed; but it was no exception, as far as fruit was concerned, to others of its kind. For it, as for them, the season, even of the earliest fruit, had not come. The seeing the fig-tree "afar off," is a touch peculiar to St. Mark, and adds force to the narrative, as implying a keener pressure of hunger than St. Matthew's description.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>) says he saw "one fig tree" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>), and therefore more conspicuous. Fig trees were no doubt plentiful in the neighborhood of Bethphage, "the house of figs." Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 418) says that "Mount Olivet is still sprinkled with fig trees." This fig tree had leaves, but no fruit; for it <span class="cmt_word">was not the season of figs</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Other trees would all be bare at this early season, but the fig trees would be putting forth their broad green leaves. It is possible that this tree, standing by itself as it would seem, was more forward than the other fig trees around. It was seen "from afar," and therefore it must have had the full benefit of the sun. Our Lord says (St. <a href="/luke/21-29.htm">Luke 21:29</a>), "Behold the fig tree, and all the trees: when they now shoot forth, ye see it, and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh." He puts the fig tree first, as being of its own nature the most forward to put forth its buds. But then it is peculiar to the fig tree that its fruit begins to appear before its leaves. It was, therefore, a natural supposition that on this tree, with its leaves fully developed, there might be found at least some ripened fruit. Our Lord, therefore, approaches the tree in his hunger, with the expectation of finding fruit. But as he draws near to it, and realizes the fact that the tree, though full of leaf, is absolutely fruitless, he forgets his natural hunger in the thought of the spiritual figure which this tree began to present to his mind. The accident of his hunger as a man, brought him into contact with a great parable of spiritual things, presented to him as God; and as he approached this fig tree full of leaf, but destitute of fruit, there stood before him the striking but awful image of the Jewish nation, having indeed the leaves of a great profession, but yielding no fruit. The leaves of this fig tree deceived the passer-by, who, from seeing them, would naturally expect the fruit. And so the fig tree was cursed, not for being barren, but for being false. When our Lord, being hungry, sought figs on the fig tree, he signified that he hungered after something which he did not find. The Jews were this unprofitable fig tree, full of the leaves of profession, but fruitless. Our Lord never did anything without reason; and, therefore, when he seemed to do anything without reason, he was setting forth in a figure some great reality.
