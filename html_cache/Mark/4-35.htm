Evening in Jewish culture begins at sunset, marking the transition from one day to the next. This setting provides a backdrop for the events that follow, emphasizing the natural rhythm of life and the human need for rest, even for Jesus and His disciples.<p><b>He said to His disciples</b><br>Jesus often used direct communication with His disciples to teach and guide them. This phrase highlights the close relationship between Jesus and His followers, who were chosen to learn directly from Him. The disciples were often privy to Jesus' plans and teachings, which were not always shared with the larger crowds. This intimate communication underscores the role of the disciples as future leaders of the early Church.<p><b>Let us cross to the other side</b><br>This directive from Jesus initiates a journey across the Sea of Galilee, a significant body of water in the region. The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Tiberias or Lake Gennesaret, is located in the northern part of Israel and is known for its sudden storms due to its geographical setting. Crossing to the other side implies a movement from the Jewish side to the predominantly Gentile region, symbolizing the broader mission of Jesus to reach all people.
