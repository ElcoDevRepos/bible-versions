Jesus' gaze often signifies His deep understanding and insight into a person's heart and situation. In biblical context, Jesus' look is not merely physical but penetrates to the spiritual and emotional state of the individual, as seen in other instances like Peter's denial (<a href="/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a>).<p><b>loved him</b><br>The love Jesus shows here is agape love, a selfless, unconditional love that seeks the best for others. This love is significant because it demonstrates Jesus' compassion and genuine concern for the man's spiritual well-being. It reflects the nature of God, who is love (1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>), and aligns with the greatest commandments to love God and neighbor (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30-31</a>).<p><b>and said to him</b><br>Jesus' words are authoritative and carry the weight of divine wisdom. His speech often reveals truth and challenges individuals to consider their spiritual state. This moment is a direct communication from the Messiah, emphasizing the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>&#8220;There is one thing you lack:</b><br>This statement highlights the man's spiritual deficiency despite his adherence to the law. It underscores the idea that salvation and eternal life cannot be earned through works alone but require a heart fully surrendered to God. This echoes the theme of the insufficiency of the law for salvation, as Paul discusses in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>.<p><b>Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor,</b><br>Jesus challenges the man to relinquish his material wealth, which is a barrier to his spiritual growth. This command reflects the biblical principle of detachment from earthly possessions to gain spiritual riches (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). It also aligns with the teachings of generosity and care for the poor found throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>).<p><b>and you will have treasure in heaven.</b><br>This promise of heavenly treasure contrasts with earthly wealth, emphasizing the eternal value of spiritual investments. It connects to Jesus' teachings on storing up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>) and the concept of eternal rewards for those who follow God's will (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-14</a>).<p><b>Then come, follow Me.&#8221;</b><br>The call to follow Jesus is an invitation to discipleship, requiring total commitment and prioritization of Christ above all else. This mirrors Jesus' earlier calls to His disciples (<a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a>) and encapsulates the essence of Christian life&#8212;following Jesus' example and teachings. It also reflects the cost of discipleship, as seen in <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who speaks to the rich young man.

In using such words our Lord taught the questioner, as He had before taught His disciples, with what clear prevision He looked forward to the form and manner of His death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus looking upon him loved him</span>.

The words express most vividly an earnest, tender, searching look. They seem, if it may be said reverently, to combine the Divine penetration with human sympathy and compassion. The counsel of our Lord which follows was not a general command, but a particular precept, which the young ruler specially needed. <span class="cmt_word">One thing thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">lackest</span>. In St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>) the words are, "If thou wouldest be perfect." But our Lord's words here, "One thing thou lackest," fit in excellently with the young ruler's question given just before in St. Matthew, "What lack I yet?" showing a substantial unity in the narrative, with just that variety which we should expect in the account of the same incident given by two independent but equally trustworthy witnesses. The "one thing thou lackest" of St. Mark, and "if thou writ be perfect of St. Matthew, both point to the same conclusion - that our Lord's object was to reveal this young man to himself. His stumbling-block was his wealth; and so our Savior at once pierces his besetting sin of covetousness. The precept was a special counsel to him; it directed him to do something which, as our Lord saw, was in his case necessary to his salvation. He could not follow Christ without parting with this sin, and with that which ministered to it. This was his particular spiritual difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">looked at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#956;&#946;&#955;&#941;&#968;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(emblepsas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1689.htm">Strong's 1689: </a> </span><span class="str2">From en and blepo; to look on, i.e. to observe fixedly, or to discern clearly.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
