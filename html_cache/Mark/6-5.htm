The context is crucial here; Jesus had returned to Nazareth, where He was well-known, and the familiarity of the people with His earthly family led to skepticism about His divine authority. This reflects a broader biblical theme where faith is often a prerequisite for experiencing God's power (<a href="/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>). The phrase does not imply a lack of power on Jesus' part but rather a lack of receptivity among the people. This situation is reminiscent of the Old Testament prophets who were often rejected by their own people (<a href="/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>).<p><b>except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.</b><br>Despite the general unbelief, Jesus' compassion is evident as He still heals a few individuals. The act of laying hands is significant in Jewish culture, symbolizing the transfer of blessing or authority (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>). This action by Jesus demonstrates His willingness to heal and bless those who have even a small measure of faith. The healing of the sick serves as a testament to His divine nature and fulfills the messianic prophecies of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speak of the Messiah bearing our infirmities. This phrase also connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus heals those who come to Him in faith, underscoring the importance of belief in His ministry (<a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in His hometown of Nazareth, where He faces unbelief from those who knew Him growing up.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>A small town in Galilee, known as Jesus' hometown.

The townspeople&#8217;s familiarity bred contempt, and their unbelief created a barrier Jesus would not override. <a href="/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a> says, &#8220;And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief,&#8221; echoing the same point.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Could not&#8221; is moral rather than mechanical. The Son who calmed storms (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and raised Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>) never lacks power. Yet He sovereignly withholds displays of that power where hearts are hardened, just as <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a> recalls Israel &#8220;limiting the Holy One.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links faith to divine action. In <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a> the woman is told, &#8220;Your faith has healed you.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God.&#8221; Nazareth chose doubt, and Jesus honored their choice.<p>&#8226; This restraint underscores human responsibility. <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a> notes that iniquities &#8220;have separated you from your God,&#8221; a truth illustrated here: unbelief short-circuits the blessings God longs to give.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them</b><p>Even in an environment thick with unbelief, grace shines through. <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a> shows that Jesus often healed by laying on hands, a gesture of personal compassion.<p>&#8226; A &#8220;few&#8221; received what the many rejected. Their quiet faith opened the door (compare <a href="/luke/8-48.htm">Luke 8:48</a>).<p>&#8226; The tenderness of touch matters. <a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a> records Jesus stretching out His hand to a leper; here, the same gentle contact reaches receptive hearts.<p>&#8226; This remnant healing reveals consistency with God&#8217;s character&#8212;slow to anger, abounding in mercy (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). While judgment met unbelief, mercy met faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a> teaches that Jesus&#8217; power is unfailing, yet He chooses to act where faith is present. Unbelief in Nazareth did not diminish His ability; it restricted the town&#8217;s experience of His mercy. Still, He healed the few who trusted Him, illustrating both the seriousness of rejecting God&#8217;s Son and the tenderness awaiting those who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He laid his hands.</span>--St. Matthew says simply, "not many miracles." The fuller description is peculiar to St. Mark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he could there do no mighty work</span>. This is a remarkable expression. <span class="accented">He could do no mighty work there.</span> The words imply want of power - that in some sense or other he was unable to do it. He did indeed perform some miracles. He laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them; but he wrought none of his greater miracles there. Of course, even these less striking miracles ought to have sufficed. in a miracle there must be the suspension of some known law of nature; and one clear instance of such suspension ought to be as conclusive as a hundred. Then it must be remembered that it is not God's method in his dealings with his creatures to force conviction upon them when the ordinary means prove insufficient. For men's actions must be free if they are to be made the test of judgment, and they would not be free if God constrained men to obey his will. The men of Nazareth had sufficient evidence had they not chosen to be blinded, and a greater amount of evidence would only have increased their condemnation. So their unbelief thwarted his purposes of mercy, and he went in and out amongst them like one hampered and disabled, marvelling at their unbelief, or rather <span class="cmt_word">marveling because of their unbelief</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). The condition of mind of these Nazarenes was what caused amazement to the Saviour. At length he turned away from Nazareth, never, so far as we know, to visit it again; for this was their second opportunity, and the second occasion which they deliberately rejected him. What, however, they refused he immediately offered to others. He was not discouraged<span class="cmt_word">.
