The concept of fulfillment is central to the New Testament, showing that Jesus' life and death were in accordance with God's predetermined plan. This fulfillment underscores the reliability and authority of Scripture, as prophecies made centuries earlier come to fruition in the life of Christ.<p><b>that says,</b><br>This introduces the specific prophecy being referenced, pointing to the importance of the written Word as a testament to God's promises. The phrase emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, where the events of Jesus' life are seen as a direct continuation and realization of the prophetic tradition.<p><b>&#8220;And he was numbered with the transgressors.&#8221;</b><br>This is a direct reference to <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, a passage from the "Suffering Servant" section of Isaiah, which is often interpreted as a messianic prophecy. The phrase signifies Jesus' identification with sinners, as He was crucified between two criminals. This act of being "numbered with the transgressors" highlights Jesus' role as the sin-bearer, taking upon Himself the sins of humanity. It also reflects the humility and self-sacrifice of Christ, who, though sinless, was willing to be counted among sinners to fulfill His redemptive mission.
