In the context of <a href="/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a>, Jesus has just interacted with the rich young ruler, who left sorrowful because he was unwilling to part with his wealth. Jesus' action of looking around may imply a deliberate engagement with His surroundings and His disciples, emphasizing the gravity of His forthcoming teaching.<p><b>and said to His disciples</b><br>Jesus often used teachable moments to instruct His disciples, who were His closest followers and would later be responsible for spreading His teachings. This direct address underscores the importance of the lesson for those who would lead the early Church. The disciples, coming from various backgrounds, including fishermen and a tax collector, would have understood the societal implications of wealth and status.<p><b>&#8220;How hard it is for the rich</b><br>The difficulty for the rich to enter the kingdom of God is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings. Wealth in the first-century Jewish context was often seen as a sign of God's favor, yet Jesus challenges this notion. The rich young ruler's story illustrates the spiritual hindrance that wealth can pose, as it may lead to reliance on material possessions rather than on God.<p><b>to enter the kingdom of God!&#8221;</b><br>The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' ministry, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. Entering the kingdom requires a heart aligned with God's values, often characterized by humility, dependence on God, and a willingness to forsake earthly attachments. This statement by Jesus serves as a warning about the spiritual dangers of wealth, echoing teachings found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus states that one cannot serve both God and money.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the challenges wealth poses to entering God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being taught about the spiritual dangers of wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_young_ruler.htm">The Rich Young Ruler</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the preceding context involves a rich young man who struggles with the call to give up his wealth to follow Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the eternal life offered to believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a> includes Jesus' journey towards Jerusalem, where He will ultimately face crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_spiritual_challenge_of_wealth.htm">The Spiritual Challenge of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can create a false sense of security and self-sufficiency, making it difficult to rely on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_radical_discipleship.htm">The Call to Radical Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to prioritize the kingdom of God over material possessions, challenging them to live with open hands and generous hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom's_inverted_values.htm">The Kingdom's Inverted Values</a></b><br>The kingdom of God often inverts worldly values, where the last become first, and the poor in spirit are blessed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's provision rather than their own resources, reflecting a heart of faith and dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focusing on eternal treasures rather than earthly wealth aligns our hearts with God's purposes and prepares us for His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_10_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 10:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_23_Wealth_vs_Spiritual_Priorities.htm">How does Mark 10:23 challenge our view of wealth and spiritual priorities?

Discipleship involves continual correction and clarification (<a href="/mark/4-10.htm">Mark 4:10</a>; <a href="/mark/8-27.htm">Mark 8:27-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples had just watched a wealthy, morally upright seeker leave saddened; now their own assumptions about blessing and success must be challenged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How hard it is</b><p>&#8226; The Lord does not say &#8220;impossible,&#8221; but &#8220;hard.&#8221; The obstacle is real and significant.<p>&#8226; Other passages echo the sober tone: &#8220;For the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>), and &#8220;We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement confronts any casual view of salvation; entry requires divine intervention and humble surrender.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the rich</b><p>&#8226; Wealth itself is not condemned, yet riches lure the heart into self-reliance. &#8220;Those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus just pinpointed the ruler&#8217;s attachment: &#8220;Go, sell whatever you own&#8230; then come, follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>). The man&#8217;s refusal illustrates the peril.<p>&#8226; The parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>) and the story of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>) reinforce the warning: abundance can numb the sense of need for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to enter the kingdom of God!</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s saving reign that one must personally enter, as Jesus told Nicodemus: &#8220;No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Entry is by grace through faith, yet earthly security often competes for that faith. Hence Jesus counsels, &#8220;Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The exclamation mark in Mark&#8217;s account conveys passion. Christ&#8217;s love compels Him to warn; He wants none to miss the everlasting kingdom because of temporary treasure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus&#8217; steady gaze, His address to committed followers, and His emphatic words form one integrated lesson: earthly riches create real, though not insurmountable, barriers to salvation. Wealth tempts the heart toward self-sufficiency, making childlike trust in Christ difficult. Only by recognizing this danger, releasing our grip on possessions, and depending wholly on God can anyone&#8212;rich or poor&#8212;enter the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And Jesus looked round.</span>--The glance and gesture are mentioned by St. Mark only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).

Partly because the love of riches tempts men to heap them up, whether lawfully or unlawfully. Partly because the love of riches binds the soul to earth, so that it is less likely to think of Partly because riches are an incentive to pride and luxury and other sins. The heathen poet Ovid could speak of riches "irritamenta malorum." Poverty and contempt of riches often open that heaven which wealth and covetousness close. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">looked around</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#949;&#968;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(periblepsamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4017.htm">Strong's 4017: </a> </span><span class="str2">To look around on, survey.
