The high priest at the time was Caiaphas, who held the position from AD 18 to 36. The high priest was the highest religious authority in Judaism, responsible for the Temple and its rituals. This event fulfills Jesus' prediction of His suffering and trial (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33</a>). The act of leading Jesus away signifies His submission to the authorities, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which describes the suffering servant as being led like a lamb to the slaughter.<p><b>and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled</b><br>This assembly represents the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of 71 members including the high priest. The chief priests were mainly Sadducees, while the elders and scribes were often Pharisees. This gathering was significant as it was an illegal night trial, contrary to Jewish law, which prohibited trials at night or during festivals. The assembly's purpose was to find a reason to condemn Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers gather against the Lord's anointed.

Annas and his five sons held the high priesthood in succession, Caiaphas, his son-in-law, stepping in between the first and the second son, and holding the office for twelve years. It is supposed that it was in the house of Annas that the price of the betrayal was paid to Judas. Annas, though not then high priest, must have had considerable influence in the counsels of the Sanhedrim; and this will probably explain the fact of our Lord having been first taken to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They led</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#942;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;gagon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lead, carry, take away; met: To be led astray, seduced.
