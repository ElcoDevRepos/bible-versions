The high priest's action here signifies his perceived blasphemy at Jesus' claim to divinity. This act also underscores the seriousness of the accusation against Jesus, as the high priest would only tear his garments in response to something he considered profoundly offensive or sacrilegious. The high priest, Caiaphas, was part of the Sadducees, a sect that held significant power in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council.<p><b>and declared,</b><br>The high priest's declaration is a formal pronouncement, indicating the gravity of the situation. In the context of a trial, his words carry the weight of authority and are meant to influence the council's decision. This moment is pivotal in the trial of Jesus, as it marks the transition from gathering evidence to making a judgment.<p><b>&#8220;Why do we need any more witnesses?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies that the high priest believes the evidence against Jesus is already sufficient. In Jewish legal proceedings, multiple witnesses were required to establish a charge (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). However, the high priest's question suggests that Jesus' own words, which he interprets as blasphemy, are enough to convict Him. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who often sought to trap Him with His own words (<a href="/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13-17</a>). The question also highlights the predetermined nature of the trial, as the leaders were already seeking a reason to condemn Jesus (<a href="/mark/14.htm">Mark 14:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest during this time was Caiaphas.

The Greek verb here rendered "rent" implies violent dramatic action. The Jewish tunic was open under the chin, and large enough to receive the head, so that it could easily be placed over the shoulders, by inserting the head. When the wearer wished to give this sign of indignation or grief, he would seize the garment at this opening with both hands, and violently tear it asunder down to the waist. But it was unlawful for the high priest to do this in a private grief (<a href="/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>). Some of the Fathers think that by this action Caiaphas involuntarily typified the rending of the priesthood from himself and from the Jewish nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-63.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
