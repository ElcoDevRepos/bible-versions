It is a common introductory phrase in the Gospels, indicating that what follows is a significant teaching. Jesus often used this phrase to capture attention and underscore the authority of His words.<p><b>that if anyone says to this mountain</b><br>The "mountain" here is often interpreted metaphorically, representing seemingly insurmountable obstacles or challenges. In the context of Jesus' ministry, mountains can symbolize significant spiritual or personal barriers. Geographically, Jesus was likely near the Mount of Olives, which would have been a familiar landmark to His listeners. The use of "this mountain" could also be a hyperbolic expression to illustrate the power of faith.<p><b>&#8216;Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,&#8217;</b><br>This imagery of a mountain being cast into the sea is hyperbolic, emphasizing the miraculous power of faith. The "sea" could refer to the Dead Sea, visible from the Mount of Olives, known for its depth and vastness. The act of moving a mountain into the sea symbolizes overcoming impossible situations through faith.<p><b>and has no doubt in his heart</b><br>Doubt is contrasted with faith throughout Scripture. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of belief and trust. This phrase underscores the necessity of unwavering faith, free from skepticism or hesitation. <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a> similarly warns against doubting, likening it to being tossed by the wind.<p><b>but believes that it will happen</b><br>Belief is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus. This phrase emphasizes the necessity of confident trust in God's power and promises. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see, highlighting the assurance required in belief.<p><b>it will be done for him</b><br>This promise reflects the power of faith in action. It aligns with other biblical assurances that God responds to faith, such as in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where Jesus states that faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains. This phrase assures believers of God's willingness to act on their behalf when they exercise genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the power of faith and prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to understand and apply His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountain.htm">Mountain</a></b><br>Symbolic of seemingly insurmountable obstacles or challenges in life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea.htm">Sea</a></b><br>Represents the vastness and depth, illustrating the complete removal of obstacles through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The broader context of this teaching is Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, where He demonstrates His authority and prepares for His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>Faith is not about the size but the sincerity and purity of belief.

When He says, &#8220;Truly,&#8221; He is guaranteeing the statement that follows (cf. <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).<p>- This echoes earlier teachings where He prefaces pivotal truths the same way (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>; <a href="/mark/10-15.htm">Mark 10:15</a>). The certainty builds faith in the listener before the command is even heard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that if anyone says to this mountain</b><p>- &#8220;Anyone&#8221; widens the promise beyond the Twelve; it embraces every believer (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>).<p>- &#8220;This mountain&#8221; was the Mount of Olives, in plain view. Jesus uses a literal landmark to make a literal point: God&#8208;enabled faith can move what is immovable (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>).<p>- Mountains symbolize daunting obstacles throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>), yet they remain real, physical entities&#8212;reminding us that God&#8217;s power is not limited to metaphor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,&#8217;</b><p>- The command is daring, picturing a total removal of the obstacle&#8212;flung far away into the depths (<a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>).<p>- The Sea likely refers to the Dead Sea nearby, reinforcing the concreteness of the illustration.<p>- This reflects God&#8217;s pattern of decisive interventions, such as the Red Sea parting (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-28</a>) and the Jordan&#8217;s retreat (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and has no doubt in his heart</b><p>- Doubt divides loyalty, so faith must be whole (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a>).<p>- The heart is the center of conviction (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>); internal certainty precedes external action.<p>- Jesus calls for single-minded trust, the same trust Abraham displayed when he &#8220;did not waver in unbelief&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but believes that it will happen,</b><p>- Biblical belief rests on God&#8217;s character, not wishful thinking (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>- Faith speaks in harmony with God&#8217;s will; it does not manipulate Him (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>).<p>- The tense is immediate: faith expects fulfillment in God&#8217;s timing, as Elijah did concerning rain after years of drought (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will be done for him</b><p>- The promise is categorical: &#8220;it will be done.&#8221; Nothing is impossible with God (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>).<p>- The action is God&#8217;s, not human force; believers speak, but God performs (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-7</a>,16).<p>- Jesus later ties the promise to prayer in the very next verse, anchoring &#8220;mountain-moving&#8221; faith in ongoing communion with the Father (<a href="/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a> assures every believer that wholehearted, doubt-free faith in God&#8217;s power and will can overcome the heaviest obstacles. Jesus uses a literal mountain and sea to show that nothing physical or spiritual stands immovably before God. Our role is to trust, speak in agreement with His revealed purposes, and watch Him accomplish what human strength never could.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Those things . . . he shall have whatsoever he saith.</span>--The better MSS. give, "that <span class= "ital">the thing</span> which he saith cometh to pass," and "he shall have <span class= "ital">it."</span> The promise is specific rather than general in its form, and so prepares the way for the wider generalisation of the next verse.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Truly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
