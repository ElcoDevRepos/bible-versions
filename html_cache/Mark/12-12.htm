This phrase indicates their intent to seize Him, reflecting their growing hostility. The leaders' desire to arrest Jesus is rooted in their perception of Him as a threat to their authority and the established religious order. This tension is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the conflict between Jesus and the religious establishment.<p><b>for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them</b><br>The parable in question is the Parable of the Tenants, which Jesus used to illustrate the rejection of God's messengers and ultimately His Son. The leaders understood that they were the wicked tenants in the story, who mistreated and killed the servants and the son of the vineyard owner. This recognition of their role in the parable underscores their awareness of their own corruption and rejection of God's message. The parable serves as a prophetic indictment of their actions and foreshadows their role in Jesus' eventual crucifixion.<p><b>But fearing the crowd</b><br>The leaders' fear of the crowd reveals the tension between their desire to eliminate Jesus and their concern for public opinion. Jesus was popular among the people, who saw Him as a prophet and teacher. The leaders were wary of inciting a riot or losing their influence over the populace. This fear of the crowd often restrained their actions, as seen in other instances where they hesitated to act against Jesus due to His widespread support.<p><b>they left Him and went away</b><br>Despite their intentions, the leaders chose to withdraw rather than confront Jesus directly at this moment. This retreat highlights their inability to act decisively against Him without risking backlash from the people. It also demonstrates Jesus' authority and the divine timing of events leading to His crucifixion. The leaders' departure is temporary, as they continue to plot against Jesus, ultimately leading to His arrest and crucifixion. This moment of withdrawal underscores the tension between human plans and divine sovereignty in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts and has just delivered a parable that convicts the religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/religious_leaders.htm">Religious Leaders</a></b><br>These include the chief priests, scribes, and elders who are the primary audience of Jesus' parable.
