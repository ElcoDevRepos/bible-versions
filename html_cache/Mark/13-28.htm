Jesus uses the fig tree as a metaphor to teach about discernment and awareness of the times. The fig tree is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/24.htm">Jeremiah 24</a> and <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, where it represents Israel. The lesson here is about understanding signs and being prepared, much like the prophets called Israel to recognize the signs of their times.<p><b>As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves,</b><br>The fig tree's cycle is well-known in the region; it loses its leaves in winter and begins to sprout new leaves in late spring. This natural process is a sign of the changing seasons. In the context of Jesus' teaching, the tender branches and new leaves symbolize the beginning of a new phase or event. This imagery is used to illustrate the importance of recognizing the signs of the times, particularly in relation to prophetic events. The tender branches can also be seen as a type of renewal or new life, which is a theme throughout Scripture, pointing to spiritual awakening and readiness.<p><b>you know that summer is near.</b><br>Summer, in this context, represents the culmination or fulfillment of a process. Just as the sprouting leaves indicate the approach of summer, the signs Jesus speaks of indicate the nearness of significant prophetic events. This phrase emphasizes the certainty and imminence of what is to come, urging believers to be vigilant and prepared. In a broader biblical context, summer can symbolize harvest and judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/amos/8.htm">Amos 8:1-2</a>, where the end of the harvest signifies the end of an era or the coming of judgment. This ties into the eschatological themes present in <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, where Jesus speaks of the end times and the need for readiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, providing a parable to His disciples about the signs of the times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to understand the signs of the end times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fig_tree.htm">Fig Tree</a></b><br>A common tree in Israel, used by Jesus as a metaphor to illustrate the discernment of signs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_signs.htm">Understanding Signs</a></b><br>Just as the fig tree's budding indicates the approach of summer, believers are called to discern the signs of the times and be prepared for Christ's return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>This passage encourages Christians to develop spiritual discernment, being attentive to the movements of God in the world and in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_for_christ's_return.htm">Readiness for Christ's Return</a></b><br>The lesson of the fig tree serves as a reminder to live in a state of readiness, anticipating the return of Jesus with hope and vigilance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/growth_and_fruitfulness.htm">Growth and Fruitfulness</a></b><br>The budding of the fig tree can also symbolize spiritual growth and fruitfulness, urging believers to cultivate their faith and bear fruit in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/connection_to_israel.htm">Connection to Israel</a></b><br>Understanding the fig tree as a symbol of Israel can deepen our appreciation for God's covenant relationship with His people and His faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_13_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 13:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_13_28_guide_discernment.htm">How does Mark 13:28 encourage us to discern spiritual seasons in our lives?

Likewise, the end-time signs Jesus listed&#8212;global turmoil, gospel proclamation, celestial disturbances&#8212;are the outward manifestations of God&#8217;s sovereign timetable (<a href="/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6-14</a>).<p>&#8226; These signs are not meant to frighten but to reassure that God&#8217;s plan is unfolding precisely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you know that summer is near</b><p>&#8226; When leaves appear, no farmer doubts that summer is close. In the same way, when believers see the prophetic signs, they can be certain that &#8220;He is near&#8212;right at the door&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-29.htm">Mark 13:29</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Near&#8221; underscores imminence, not delay (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). Though the exact day remains hidden (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>), the season will be obvious.<p>&#8226; This knowledge fuels readiness and hope (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus uses the fig tree to give a simple, reliable gauge: just as tender branches and fresh leaves announce summer, the clear prophetic signs He listed will announce His imminent return. He expects His followers to notice, learn, and live alert, confident that Scripture&#8217;s timetable is perfectly trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Ye know that summer is near.</span>--Many of the best MSS. give "it is known," but it may fairly be assumed, from the parallel passages in St. Matthew and St. Luke, that this was the error of an early transcriber of the document which served as a basis for the reports of all the three Evangelists.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now from the fig tree learn her parable</span>; that is, her own particular teaching. Our Lord makes frequent mention and use of the fig tree, as we have seen already. It is probable that a fig tree may have been near to them. <span class="cmt_word">When her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh</span>. The branch (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) would be the young shoot, now become tender under the quickening influences of the spring; and this was an evident sign that the summer was at hand. The Asiatic fig tree requires a considerable amount of warmth to enable it to put forth leaves and fruit. Its rich flavour requires a summer heat to mature it. Aristotle says that the fig is the choice food of bees, from which they make their richest honey. Then the fig tree does not flower after the ordinary manner; but produces flower and fruit at once from the tree, and rapidly matures the fruit. The lesson, therefore, from the fig tree is this - the speed with which she ripens her fruit when she feels the warmth of summer. In like manner, as soon as the disciples perceived the signs of Christ's coming, they were to learn that he was close at hand, as certainly as the ripening fruit of the fig tree showed that summer was at hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">learn</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(mathete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3129.htm">Strong's 3129: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prolongation from a primary verb, another form of which, matheo, is used as an alternate in certain tenses; to learn.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
