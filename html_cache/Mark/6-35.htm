The timing is significant as it indicates the end of the day, a period when people would typically be preparing to rest and eat. The lateness of the hour emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the disciples' concern for the crowd's well-being. In biblical times, the setting of the sun marked the end of the day, and activities would cease, highlighting the need for a solution to feed the multitude before nightfall.<p><b>So the disciples came to Jesus and said,</b><br>The disciples approaching Jesus demonstrates their reliance on Him for guidance and solutions. This reflects a pattern throughout the Gospels where the disciples turn to Jesus in times of need or uncertainty. It also shows their growing understanding of His authority and ability to provide. This interaction is a precursor to the miracle, emphasizing the disciples' role in the narrative and their relationship with Jesus as their teacher and leader.<p><b>&#8220;This is a desolate place,</b><br>The description of the location as "desolate" underscores the isolation and lack of resources available to the crowd. This setting is significant as it highlights the miraculous nature of the feeding that follows. The wilderness or desolate places in Scripture often serve as settings for divine encounters and provision, reminiscent of God providing manna in the wilderness for the Israelites (Exodus 16). It also symbolizes spiritual barrenness, which Jesus addresses through His teaching and miracles.<p><b>and the hour is already late.&#8221;</b><br>Reiterating the lateness of the hour emphasizes the urgency and the disciples' concern for the practical needs of the people. This repetition underscores the human limitations and the pressing need for divine intervention. The disciples' statement sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His compassion and power, foreshadowing the miraculous provision that will follow. It also serves as a reminder of Jesus' ability to transcend time and circumstance to meet the needs of His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching the crowds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_desolate_place.htm">The Desolate Place</a></b><br>A remote area where Jesus and His disciples had gone to find rest, but were followed by a large crowd.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people who followed Jesus to hear His teachings and witness His miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>The setting for the miracle of feeding the 5,000, which follows this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_human_limitations.htm">Recognizing Human Limitations</a></b><br>The disciples acknowledge the lateness of the hour and the desolation of the place, highlighting human limitations in contrast to divine provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_jesus.htm">Dependence on Jesus</a></b><br>In times of need and desolation, we are reminded to turn to Jesus, who can provide beyond our expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The disciples' concern for the crowd's needs prompts them to seek Jesus' guidance, illustrating the importance of faith in action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing.htm">God's Timing</a></b><br>The mention of the late hour reminds us that God's timing is perfect, even when it seems inconvenient to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_others.htm">Compassion for Others</a></b><br>The disciples' awareness of the crowd's needs reflects the importance of compassion and care for others in our Christian walk.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_6_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 6:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_35_Trust_God_s_provision.htm">How does Mark 6:35 inspire us to trust God's provision in scarcity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_35_Jesus_compassion_explained.htm">What does Mark 6:35 teach about Jesus' compassion for physical and spiritual needs?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Mark_6_35_to_serve_today.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example in Mark 6:35 to serve others today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Mark_6_35_to_Exodus_16_4_s_provision.htm">How does Mark 6:35 connect with God's provision in Exodus 16:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_6_35_teach_God_s_timing.htm">In what ways can Mark 6:35 encourage us to rely on God's timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_a_remote_place_in_Mark_6_35.htm">Why did Jesus choose a remote place in Mark 6:35 for teaching the crowd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_35_Jesus_compassion_shown.htm">How does Mark 6:35 reflect Jesus' compassion for the people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Mark_6_35_Disciples_view_on_Jesus_mission.htm">What does Mark 6:35 reveal about the disciples' understanding of Jesus' mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jesus_walk_on_water_scientifically.htm">In Mark 6:48&#8211;51, how can Jesus walking on water be reconciled with known scientific laws? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_miracle_accounts_differ_in_gospels.htm">Why do the accounts of the same miracle differ between Matthew 14 and the other Gospels, possibly indicating inconsistencies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_allow_disciples_a_staff.htm">Did Jesus allow his disciples to keep a staff on their journey?

Thus our Lord prepared the way for his miracle, he detained the multitude till the day was far spent, so that the disciples might be induced to pray him to dismiss them. This would open the way for him to direct the disciples to feed them. And thus the miracle would appear all the more evident in proportion as they found themselves in a strait, and utterly destitute of the needful supplies of food for such a multitude in the desert. St. John's account here is much more full. He tells us (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>) that Jesus, addressing Philip, said, "Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?" And he adds, "This he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do." Our Lord, it would seem, asked Philip rather than the others, because Philip was simple-minded, sincere, and teachable, rather than clever, and so was accustomed to ask things which appeared plain to others. We have an instance of this simplicity of mind in the question which he asks (<a href="/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a>), "Lord show us the Father, and it sufficeth us." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hour</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8037;&#961;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;ras)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5610.htm">Strong's 5610: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently a primary word; an 'hour'.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genomen&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">already</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#948;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;d&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2235.htm">Strong's 2235: </a> </span><span class="str2">Already; now at length, now after all this waiting.
