He did not limit His work to a single location but traveled extensively throughout the region. This reflects the itinerant nature of His mission, reaching diverse populations. The mention of "villages and towns and countrysides" indicates that His message and healing were accessible to all, regardless of their social or economic status. This approach fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as bringing good news to the poor and healing the brokenhearted.<p><b>they laid the sick in the marketplaces</b><br>Marketplaces were central to community life in ancient times, serving as hubs for trade, social interaction, and public gatherings. By bringing the sick to these locations, people ensured maximum exposure to Jesus' healing power. This act demonstrates the desperation and faith of the people, believing that proximity to Jesus could bring healing. The public nature of these healings also served to spread His fame and the message of the Kingdom of God.<p><b>and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak.</b><br>The "fringe of His cloak" refers to the tassels (tzitzit) that Jewish men wore on the corners of their garments, as commanded in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>. These tassels were a reminder of God's commandments and a symbol of piety. The act of touching the fringe signifies faith in Jesus' divine authority and power. This mirrors the earlier account of the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>, who was healed by touching Jesus' garment, illustrating the belief that even the smallest contact with Him could result in miraculous healing.<p><b>And all who touched Him were healed.</b><br>This statement underscores the completeness and universality of Jesus' healing power. It emphasizes that faith in Jesus, even expressed through a simple touch, was sufficient for healing. This reflects the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speak of the Messiah bearing our infirmities and bringing healing.
