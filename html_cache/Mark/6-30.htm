This gathering indicates a return from their mission, as described earlier in <a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7-13</a>, where Jesus sent them out two by two. The gathering around Jesus suggests a close, intimate relationship and a desire to report back to their teacher. This reflects the practice of discipleship in Jewish culture, where students would return to their rabbi to discuss their experiences and learn further.<p><b>and brought Him news of all they had done and taught.</b><br>The apostles were eager to share their experiences, highlighting the importance of accountability and communication in ministry. This phrase underscores the dual focus of their mission: actions ("done") and teachings ("taught"). Their activities likely included healing the sick and casting out demons, as Jesus had empowered them to do. This mirrors Jesus' own ministry, emphasizing the continuation of His work through His followers. The report back to Jesus also serves as a model for Christian ministry, where actions and teachings are both crucial and should align with the teachings of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The twelve disciples chosen by Jesus, who were sent out to preach, heal, and cast out demons.
