The mountain is traditionally identified as Mount Tabor, though some suggest Mount Hermon due to its proximity to Caesarea Philippi. The event signifies a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, revealing His divine glory to the disciples. The mountain setting echoes significant Old Testament events, such as Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai, highlighting the continuity of God's revelation.<p><b>Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen</b><br>Jesus instructs the disciples to maintain secrecy about the transfiguration. This command reflects the "Messianic Secret," a theme in the Gospels where Jesus often tells others not to reveal His identity or miracles. This secrecy is strategic, preventing misunderstandings about His mission as a political Messiah and allowing His ministry to unfold according to divine timing. The disciples' understanding of Jesus' identity and mission was still developing, and premature disclosure could lead to confusion or opposition.<p><b>until the Son of Man had risen from the dead</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a figure with authority and dominion. Jesus uses this title to emphasize both His humanity and His divine authority. The reference to rising from the dead foreshadows His resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith. This prediction underscores the necessity of His death and resurrection for the fulfillment of His redemptive work. The disciples' later testimony would be grounded in the reality of the resurrection, providing a complete understanding of Jesus' mission and identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is instructing His disciples in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples who were with Jesus during the Transfiguration and are now descending the mountain with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>The location of the Transfiguration, where Jesus was revealed in His glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>The event where Jesus' divine nature was revealed to Peter, James, and John.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>A title Jesus uses for Himself, emphasizing His role in fulfilling prophecy and His future resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timing_in_revelation.htm">The Importance of Timing in Revelation</a></b><br>Jesus instructs His disciples to keep the vision of the Transfiguration secret until after His resurrection.

They were not even to tell their fellow-disciples, lest it might cause vexation or envy that they had not been thus favored. The time of our Lord's resurrection would be a fitting opportunity for revealing this mystery; and then the disciples would understand and believe it, when, after his passion and death, which were an offense to them, they should see him rising in glory, of which event the Transfiguration was a type. For, by the Resurrection they would certainly know that Christ underwent the death of the cross, not by constraint, but of his own accord, and out of his great love for us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[As]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
