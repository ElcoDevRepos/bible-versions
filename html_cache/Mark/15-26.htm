This served as a deterrent to others who might consider committing similar offenses. In the case of Jesus, the charge was written in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, ensuring that all who passed by could read it. This trilingual inscription highlights the universal nature of Jesus' kingship and the widespread reach of the Roman Empire.<p><b>THE KING OF THE JEWS.</b><br>This title, while intended as a mockery by the Roman authorities, holds profound theological significance. It acknowledges Jesus' messianic role as the promised King from the line of David, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as those found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. The title also reflects the tension between Jesus' spiritual kingdom and the political expectations of a messianic deliverer who would overthrow Roman rule. Pilate's inscription, though meant to ridicule, inadvertently proclaimed a truth about Jesus' identity and mission. This title connects to other scriptural references, such as <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>, where Jesus explains that His kingdom is not of this world, and <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, which describes Jesus as "King of kings and Lord of lords."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Messiah, and the Son of God.

This would probably be the shortest form of inscription, and in Latin, "Rex Judaeorum." All the evangelists mention the inscription; but no two of them in precisely the same words. It appears by comparison of them that the whole title was, "This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." In the case of remarkable prisoners the accusation was written on a white tablet, and carried before them as they went to the place of execution. It was then placed over their heads when the cross was erected. St. John tells us that our Lord's title was written in three languages - Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Such appears to be the proper order of the words, namely, the national, the official, and the common dialect. St. Mark, writing at Rome, would naturally mention the Latin title. It is quite possible that the superscription may have varied in the different renderings in which it was given. It is evident from St. John (<a href="/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19-22</a>) that the title was much canvassed by the Jews and the chief priests. Bode says that this title was fitly placed over his head, because, although he was crucified in weakness for us, yet he shone with the majesty of a King above his cross. The title proclaimed that he was after all a King; and that from henceforth he began to reign from his cross over the Jews. And therefore Pilate was divinely restrained from making any alteration in the title, so that it should mean anything less than this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
