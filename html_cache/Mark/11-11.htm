Jerusalem is the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple, the heart of Jewish worship. Jesus' entry fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem riding on a donkey, symbolizing peace and humility.<p><b>and went into the temple courts.</b><br>The temple courts were the outer areas of the Temple, accessible to all, including Gentiles. This area was often bustling with activity, including buying and selling, which Jesus would later address. The Temple was the focal point of Jewish worship and sacrifice, and Jesus' presence here signifies His authority and His role as the true High Priest.<p><b>He looked around at everything,</b><br>Jesus' observation indicates His awareness and understanding of the spiritual state of the Temple and its practices. This act of looking around is a prelude to His cleansing of the Temple, which He would perform the following day. It reflects His concern for true worship and the purity of God's house.<p><b>but since it was already late,</b><br>The mention of the time suggests that Jesus' actions were deliberate and planned. The lateness of the hour indicates that He chose to wait until the next day to take action, showing His patience and strategic approach to His mission.<p><b>He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</b><br>Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, was a place of refuge and rest for Jesus. It was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, His close friends. This retreat to Bethany underscores the importance of fellowship and rest in the midst of ministry. The presence of the Twelve highlights the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry and His role as a teacher and leader to His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who enters Jerusalem as part of His final week leading to the crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, significant in Jewish history and prophecy, where Jesus enters triumphantly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer area of the temple in Jerusalem, a place of worship and teaching, where Jesus observes the activities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem, where Jesus often stayed, especially during the final week of His life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve.htm">The Twelve</a></b><br>The twelve apostles who were Jesus' closest followers and companions during His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_observation.htm">The Significance of Observation</a></b><br>Jesus' act of looking around the temple courts signifies the importance of understanding and discerning the spiritual state of our surroundings before taking action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timing.htm">The Importance of Timing</a></b><br>Jesus' decision to leave and return the next day shows the importance of God's timing in addressing issues, teaching us patience and discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_temple.htm">The Role of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple represents a place of worship and reverence.

The minuteness and precision of St. Mark's report are in themselves, <span class= "ital">prima facie,</span> an evidence in its favour. The word "eventide" is somewhat indefinite, but it included the two or three hours before sunset, as well as after. The procession, if it started in the morning, had probably been delayed by frequent halts, and its movement through such a dense crowd must have been but slow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - This visit to the temple is not mentioned by St. Matthew. It is an important addition to his narrative. The moment of our Lord's triumphant entry into Jerusalem was not the moment for the display of his indignation against the profaners of the temple. He was then surrounded by an enthusiastic and admiring multitude; so he contented himself on this occasion with looking <span class="cmt_word">round about upon all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). His keen and searching eye saw at a glance all that was going on, and penetrated everything. But without any comment or action at that time, he went out unto Bethany (it was now eventide) with the twelve. No doubt the disciples, and especially Peter, saw what was involved in this visit of inspection, which prepared them for what took place on the morrow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] entered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eis&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
