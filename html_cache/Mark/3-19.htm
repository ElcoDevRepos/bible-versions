His surname, "Iscariot," likely indicates his origin from Kerioth, a town in Judea, distinguishing him from the other Judas among the disciples. Judas's role as the treasurer for the group (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>) suggests he was trusted with financial matters, yet his character is often associated with greed and betrayal. His inclusion among the apostles fulfills the necessity of having a betrayer, as prophesied in the Old Testament (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>).<p><b>who betrayed Jesus</b><br>Judas's betrayal is a pivotal event in the Passion narrative. He agreed to hand Jesus over to the chief priests for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>), fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>. This act of betrayal is significant in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as it leads to Jesus's arrest, trial, and crucifixion. Judas's actions are often seen as a warning against the dangers of hypocrisy and the love of money. His betrayal is a stark contrast to the loyalty and faithfulness expected of a disciple, highlighting the theme of human free will and divine sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus.
