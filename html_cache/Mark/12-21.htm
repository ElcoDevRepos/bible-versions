According to <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>, if a man died without leaving a son, his brother was to marry the widow to produce offspring in the deceased brother's name. This practice ensured the continuation of the family line and the preservation of property within the family. The cultural importance of family lineage and inheritance in ancient Israel is highlighted here, reflecting the societal norms and legal obligations of the time.<p><b>but he also died and left no children</b><br>The repetition of death and childlessness emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the Sadducees' question to Jesus, as they were attempting to challenge the concept of resurrection, which they did not believe in. This scenario underscores the futility and tragedy of the situation, as the family line remains unfulfilled. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual barrenness without Christ, who is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets.<p><b>And the third did likewise</b><br>The continuation of the pattern with the third brother further illustrates the Sadducees' attempt to create an absurd scenario to trap Jesus. This reflects their misunderstanding of the resurrection and the power of God. In a broader biblical context, the number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection, which contrasts with the incompleteness and imperfection of the Sadducees' understanding. This passage invites reflection on the nature of eternal life and the transformative power of the resurrection, as later clarified by Jesus in His response.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_brother.htm">The Second Brother</a></b><br>In the context of the Sadducees' question to Jesus, the second brother marries the widow in accordance with the Levirate marriage law, but he also dies childless.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>She is central to the hypothetical scenario presented by the Sadducees, having been married to multiple brothers in succession, each dying without leaving children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_brother.htm">The Third Brother</a></b><br>Like the second, he marries the widow and also dies without producing offspring, continuing the pattern set in the Sadducees' question.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, they present this scenario to Jesus to challenge the concept of resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure who is being questioned by the Sadducees, ultimately providing a profound teaching on the resurrection and the nature of life after death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_levirate_marriage.htm">Understanding Levirate Marriage</a></b><br>The practice of Levirate marriage was designed to preserve family lineage and inheritance.
