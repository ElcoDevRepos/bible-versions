The Sea of Galilee, where this event likely took place, was a central location for Jesus' ministry. The act of stepping ashore signifies His readiness to engage with the people, emphasizing His accessibility and willingness to meet the needs of the crowd.<p><b>and saw a large crowd</b><br>The presence of a large crowd reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the people's eagerness to hear His teachings and witness His miracles. This crowd likely consisted of a diverse group, including Jews from various regions, illustrating the widespread impact of His ministry. The gathering of such a crowd also fulfills the prophetic anticipation of a leader who would draw people to Himself.<p><b>He had compassion on them</b><br>Jesus' compassion is a recurring theme in the Gospels, demonstrating His deep love and concern for humanity. This compassion is not merely an emotional response but a driving force for His actions. It reflects the heart of God, who is described in the Old Testament as compassionate and gracious (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). Jesus' compassion here is a model for Christian ministry, emphasizing the importance of empathy and care for others.<p><b>because they were like sheep without a shepherd</b><br>This imagery of sheep without a shepherd is rich in biblical symbolism. In the Old Testament, leaders of Israel are often described as shepherds, and the people as sheep (<a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34:1-10</a>). The lack of a shepherd implies a lack of guidance, protection, and care. Jesus, as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), fulfills the role of the true leader who provides for and guides His people. This phrase also echoes Moses' concern for Israel in <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>, where he asks God to appoint a leader so the people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.<p><b>And He began to teach them many things</b><br>Teaching was central to Jesus' ministry, and His teachings often focused on the Kingdom of God, repentance, and righteousness. The phrase indicates that Jesus' response to the crowd's need was to provide spiritual nourishment through His words. This teaching would have included parables, moral instructions, and revelations about God's nature and His plan for salvation. Jesus' role as a teacher fulfills the prophetic expectation of a prophet like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>), who would guide the people with divine wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His compassion and role as a teacher and shepherd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_large_crowd.htm">The Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the people who were seeking Jesus, illustrating their spiritual hunger and need for guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep_without_a_shepherd.htm">Sheep Without a Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Jesus to describe the spiritual state of the crowd, indicating their lack of direction and leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/teaching.htm">Teaching</a></b><br>The act of Jesus imparting wisdom and guidance to the crowd, addressing their spiritual needs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>The setting where Jesus and the crowd are located, emphasizing the physical and spiritual journey of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_as_a_core_attribute_of_jesus.htm">Compassion as a Core Attribute of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' compassion is not just an emotion but a driving force for action.
