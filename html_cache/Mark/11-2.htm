This command reflects His role as a teacher and leader, guiding His followers in preparation for His entry into Jerusalem. It also highlights the obedience expected from His disciples.<p><b>Go into the village ahead of you</b><br>The village is likely Bethphage, located near Bethany on the Mount of Olives. This area is significant in biblical history, as it is close to Jerusalem and often served as a place of rest and preparation for those entering the city. The instruction to go ahead indicates a deliberate plan and purpose in Jesus' actions.<p><b>and as soon as you enter it</b><br>This phrase underscores the immediacy and precision of Jesus' knowledge. It suggests divine insight, as He knows exactly what the disciples will encounter upon entering the village. This foreknowledge is a testament to His divine nature.<p><b>you will find a colt tied there</b><br>The colt, a young donkey, is significant in fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of the Messiah entering Jerusalem on a donkey. The colt being tied indicates it is ready and waiting for its purpose, symbolizing peace and humility, contrasting with a war horse.<p><b>on which no one has ever sat</b><br>In biblical times, animals that had not been used for ordinary purposes were often reserved for sacred tasks. This detail emphasizes the colt's purity and suitability for carrying the Messiah. It also signifies a new beginning, as Jesus' entry into Jerusalem marks a pivotal moment in His ministry.<p><b>Untie it and bring it here</b><br>The act of untying the colt can symbolize liberation and readiness for service. Jesus' command to bring the colt to Him reflects His authority over creation and His role as the orchestrator of events leading to His crucifixion and resurrection.

Like when He sent out the Twelve with clear directions (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7-13</a>), He equips followers with what they need before asking them to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go into the village ahead of you</b><p>The Lord directs them to a specific place&#8212;&#8220;the village opposite you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-30.htm">Luke 19:30</a>). Obedience often begins with a simple step toward a clear, practical target. Abraham&#8217;s journey to Mount Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1-3</a>) and Peter&#8217;s instruction to go to &#8220;the house of Cornelius&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19-20</a>) echo this pattern: God guides purposefully, expecting trustful, immediate response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and as soon as you enter it</b><p>Timing matters. Jesus assures them they will see the sign the moment they arrive. This immediacy echoes Elijah&#8217;s experience when the ravens fed him &#8220;morning and evening&#8221; exactly as God said (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>). For believers, prompt obedience often meets prompt confirmation of God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will find a colt tied there</b><p>A specific young donkey, already prepared, highlights Jesus&#8217; omniscience and the Father&#8217;s quiet provision (<a href="/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>). It fulfills the prophecy, &#8220;Behold, your King is coming to you&#8230; riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). The colt&#8217;s presence also suggests the hidden ways God lines up details long before we arrive on scene (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on which no one has ever sat</b><p>An unbroken colt signifies purity and set-apartness for sacred use (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>).

Jesus frees what is bound so it can carry His presence. &#8220;Bring it here&#8221; points to proximity: the closer we draw what is released to Jesus, the more it fulfills its purpose (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-2.htm">Mark 11:2</a> reveals Jesus&#8217; detailed authority, prophetic fulfillment, and gracious preparation.

The village over against them would most likely be Beth-phage, towards which they were then approaching. <span class="cmt_word">Straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat</span>. St. Mark mentions only the colt. St. Matthew mentions the ass and the colt. But St. Mark singles out the colt as that which our Lord specially needed; the mother of the animal accompanying it as a sumpter. Animals which had never before been used were alone admissible for sacred purposes. We read in Numbers (Numbers 19:2) of "the heifer on which never came yoke." Our Lord here beholds things absent and out of sight, as though they were present. So that he revealed this to his disciples by the gift of prophecy which his divinity added to his humanity. Here, therefore, is a manifest proof of his divinity. It was by the same Divine power that he revealed to Nathanael what had taken place under the fig tree. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
