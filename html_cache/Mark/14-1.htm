It involves the sacrifice of a lamb and the application of its blood, symbolizing protection and redemption. The Feast of Unleavened Bread, which begins immediately after Passover, lasts seven days and involves the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing purity and separation from sin. These events are deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and are celebrated annually in Jerusalem, drawing large crowds. The timing of these feasts is crucial, as they set the stage for Jesus' crucifixion, aligning with the sacrificial themes of Passover, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a covert way to arrest Jesus and kill Him</b><br>The chief priests and scribes were influential religious leaders in Jewish society, responsible for maintaining religious law and order. Their desire to arrest Jesus stems from His growing popularity and His teachings, which challenged their authority and exposed their hypocrisy (Matthew 23). The term "covert way" indicates their fear of public backlash, as Jesus was widely regarded as a prophet by the people (<a href="/matthew/21-46.htm">Matthew 21:46</a>). Their plot to kill Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being rejected and suffering (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-7</a>). This conspiracy highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious establishment, ultimately leading to His sacrificial death, which is central to Christian theology as the means of atonement for sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_and_the_feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>These are significant Jewish festivals commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt.
