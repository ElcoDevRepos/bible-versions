The context is Jesus' Olivet Discourse, where He warns His disciples about future tribulations. Historically, early Christians were often arrested and brought before authorities, as seen in <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-3</a> and <a href="/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17-18</a>. This reflects the reality of Roman and Jewish opposition to the nascent Christian movement.<p><b>do not worry beforehand what to say</b><br>Jesus instructs His followers not to be anxious about their defense. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a> about trusting God for provision. The cultural context of the time involved legal proceedings where defendants were expected to prepare their defense, but Jesus emphasizes reliance on divine guidance over human preparation.<p><b>Instead, speak whatever you are given at that time</b><br>This suggests a reliance on divine inspiration rather than human wisdom. The phrase implies that God will provide the necessary words, similar to the promise in <a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>, where God assures Moses He will help him speak. This reflects a theme of divine provision and guidance throughout Scripture.<p><b>for it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit</b><br>This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit as the source of wisdom and guidance. In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is often depicted as the helper and advocate for believers (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). This assurance is fulfilled in instances like <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>, where Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, speaks boldly before the Sanhedrin.
