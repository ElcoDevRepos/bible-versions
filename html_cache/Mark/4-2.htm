This approach was effective in engaging listeners and prompting them to think deeply about the Kingdom of God. Parables were a common teaching tool in Jewish culture, allowing complex ideas to be communicated through relatable scenarios. By using parables, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of opening the mouth in parables. This method also served to reveal truths to those open to understanding while concealing them from those who were hard-hearted (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-15</a>).<p><b>and in His teaching He said</b><br>The phrase indicates that Jesus was actively engaged in instructing His audience, emphasizing His role as a teacher. His teachings were authoritative and transformative, often challenging the prevailing religious norms of the time. The setting for this teaching was likely in Galilee, where Jesus spent much of His ministry. This region was a melting pot of cultures and ideas, making it a strategic location for spreading His message. Jesus' teachings were not just informative but also invitational, calling listeners to a deeper relationship with God and a commitment to living out the principles of the Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowd using parables.

This was a new system of teaching. For some months he had taught directly. But as he found that this direct teaching was met in some quarters with unbelief and scorn, he abandoned it for the less direct method of the parable. The parable (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>) is etymologically the setting forth of one thing by the side of another, so that the one may be compared with the other. The parable is the truth presented by a similitude. It differs from the proverb inasmuch as it is necessarily figurative. The proverb <span class="accented">may</span> be figurative, but it need not of necessity be figurative. The parable is often an expanded proverb, and the proverb a condensed parable. There is but one Hebrew word for the two English words "parable" and "proverb," which may account for their being frequently interchanged. The proverb (Latin) is a common sentiment generally accepted. The parable (Greek) is something put by the side of something else. Theologically, it is something in the world of nature which finds its counterpart in the world of spirit. The parable attracts attention, and so becomes valuable as a test of character. It reveals the seekers after truth, those who love the light. It withdraws the light from those who love darkness. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto them in his doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in his teaching</span>, <span class="accented">n</span>amely, that particular mode of teaching which he bad just introduced; "he taught them" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).
