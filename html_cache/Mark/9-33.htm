Situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, it was a bustling fishing village and trade center. Archaeological excavations have uncovered a synagogue and what is believed to be the house of Peter, indicating its importance in early Christian history. Capernaum's frequent mention in the Gospels highlights its role as a backdrop for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles, such as healing the centurion's servant and Peter's mother-in-law. This setting underscores the transition from public ministry to more intimate teaching moments with His disciples.<p><b>While Jesus was in the house,</b><br>The phrase "in the house" suggests a private setting, likely Peter's home, where Jesus often stayed. This intimate environment allowed for personal instruction and reflection away from the crowds. In Jewish culture, the home was a place of learning and hospitality, where rabbis would teach their disciples. This setting emphasizes the shift from public discourse to private mentorship, highlighting the importance of personal relationship and instruction in discipleship.<p><b>He asked them,</b><br>Jesus often used questions to provoke thought and self-examination among His disciples. This method of teaching was common among rabbis, encouraging students to engage deeply with the subject matter. By asking questions, Jesus not only addressed immediate issues but also guided His disciples toward greater spiritual understanding and maturity.<p><b>&#8220;What were you discussing on the way?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals Jesus' awareness of His disciples' conversations and concerns. The journey to Capernaum likely involved discussions about the events they had witnessed, including the Transfiguration and Jesus' predictions of His death and resurrection. The disciples' discussions often reflected their misunderstandings and ambitions, such as debates about who among them was the greatest. This question serves as a catalyst for Jesus to address issues of pride and humility, leading to teachings on servanthood and the nature of true greatness in the Kingdom of God. It also connects to other scriptural themes, such as the last being first and the call to childlike faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the teacher and leader of the disciples, guiding them in understanding the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from Him and are often depicted as struggling to fully grasp His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, often serving as a base for Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Likely a private residence in Capernaum where Jesus and His disciples could gather away from the crowds.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_discussion.htm">The Discussion</a></b><br>The disciples were discussing who among them was the greatest, revealing their misunderstanding of Jesus' teachings on humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_over_ambition.htm">Humility Over Ambition</a></b><br>Jesus challenges the worldly view of greatness, emphasizing that true greatness in His Kingdom is marked by humility and service to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-reflection.htm">Self-Reflection</a></b><br>The question Jesus asks the disciples encourages self-reflection on their motives and desires.

The arrival at Capernaum is given by St. Matthew in connection with the narrative of the <span class= "ital">didrachma</span> or tribute money, which in his Gospel immediately precedes that now before us.

It has been well noticed that this passage, given in substance in all the synoptic Gospels, is a striking evidence of the truthfulness and impartiality of the disciples. This dispute of theirs might easily have been suppressed as scarcely creditable to them. But in writing the Gospels the evangelists thought more of what exalted the Savior than what abased themselves. This dispute of the disciples shows how thoroughly they realized the nearness of his kingdom, and at the same time how much they had yet to learn as to the qualifications necessary for admission to it. It is not unlikely that the preference given by our Lord to Peter, James, and John may have given occasion for his contention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Capernaum.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#961;&#957;&#945;&#959;&#973;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Kapharnaoum)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2584.htm">Strong's 2584: </a> </span><span class="str2">Capernaum, a town of Galilee.
