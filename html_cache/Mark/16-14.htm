Meals were significant in the ancient Near East, often symbolizing community and covenant. The disciples were likely gathered in a private home, possibly in Jerusalem, where they had been staying since the crucifixion.<p><b>Jesus appeared to the Eleven</b><br>The "Eleven" refers to the original twelve disciples minus Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Jesus and subsequently died. This appearance underscores the physical resurrection of Jesus, affirming His bodily presence.

Despite His previous predictions of His resurrection (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:34), they struggled to accept the testimony of the resurrection. This hardness of heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with a lack of faith and understanding (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen</b><br>The disciples' disbelief in the testimony of the women and other witnesses (such as Mary Magdalene and the two disciples on the road to Emmaus) highlights the challenge of accepting the miraculous. This skepticism serves as a contrast to the faith that Jesus calls His followers to exhibit. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>) and affirming Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to His disciples, demonstrating His victory over death and His divine authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eleven.htm">The Eleven</a></b><br>The remaining disciples of Jesus, excluding Judas Iscariot, who are gathered together and are rebuked for their unbelief.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_meal.htm">The Meal</a></b><br>The setting in which Jesus appears to the disciples, indicating a moment of fellowship and community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebuke.htm">The Rebuke</a></b><br>Jesus' correction of the disciples for their lack of faith and hardness of heart, emphasizing the importance of belief in His resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses_of_the_resurrection.htm">Witnesses of the Resurrection</a></b><br>Those who had seen Jesus after His resurrection and whose testimony the disciples initially doubted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith.htm">The Importance of Faith</a></b><br>Jesus' rebuke highlights the necessity of faith in the Christian life.

"Unto the <span class="accented">eleven."</span> If, as seems evident, this appearance refers to the day of our Lord's resurrection, there would be only <span class="accented">ten</span> present; for Thomas was not then with them. Still, they might be called the eleven, because the apostolic college was reduced to eleven after the betrayal by Judas; so that they might still be called the eleven, although Thomas was absent. St. Bernard says on this, "If Christ comes and is present when we sit at meat, how much more when we kneel in prayer!" <span class="cmt_word">He upbraided them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). This is a strong word of rebuke. They ought to have received the testimony of competent witnesses. But their doubts were only removed by the evidence of their senses; just as afterwards in the case of Thomas. St. Mark is always careful to record the rebukes administered by our Lord to his apostles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Later</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8029;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hysteron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5305.htm">Strong's 5305: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lastly, afterward, later.
