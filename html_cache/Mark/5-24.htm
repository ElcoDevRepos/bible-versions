It demonstrates Jesus' compassion and readiness to help those in need, regardless of their social status. This action reflects the nature of Jesus' ministry, which often involved personal interactions and acts of healing. It also highlights the faith of Jairus, who approached Jesus despite potential criticism from other religious leaders. This moment is a precursor to the miracle that Jesus will perform, showcasing His divine authority over life and death.<p><b>and a large crowd followed</b><br>The presence of a large crowd is a recurring theme in the Gospels, illustrating Jesus' growing popularity and the public's fascination with His teachings and miracles. This crowd likely consisted of people from various backgrounds, drawn by the hope of witnessing a miracle or receiving healing themselves. The crowd's presence also sets the stage for the subsequent miracle involving the woman with the issue of blood, emphasizing the chaotic and pressing environment in which these events unfold. The crowd's following of Jesus can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, where people walking in darkness have seen a great light.<p><b>and pressed around Him</b><br>The pressing of the crowd around Jesus signifies the urgency and desperation of the people seeking His attention and healing. This physical closeness underscores the human need for divine intervention and the tangible presence of God among His people. It also highlights the challenges Jesus faced in His ministry, as He navigated through the demands and expectations of the masses. This scene foreshadows the healing of the woman with the issue of blood, who, despite the crowd, manages to touch Jesus' garment, demonstrating her faith and His power to heal even in the midst of chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus.htm">Jairus</a></b><br>A synagogue leader who approaches Jesus for help because his daughter is dying (context from surrounding verses).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_large_crowd.htm">The Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the multitude of people who followed Jesus, eager to witness His miracles and hear His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>This verse is part of the account where Jesus is on His way to heal Jairus's daughter, demonstrating His compassion and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_compassion_of_jesus.htm">The Compassion of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to go with Jairus shows His compassion and readiness to respond to those in need.

Observe here the promptitude of Christ to assist the afflicted. St. Chrysostom suggests that our Lord purposely interposed some delay, by healing, as he went, the woman with the issue of blood, in order that the actual death of the daughter of Jairus might take place; and that so there might be full demonstration of his resurrection power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(met&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
