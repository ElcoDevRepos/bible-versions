His actions fulfill the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the psalmist. The arrangement of a signal indicates premeditation and a calculated betrayal. In the cultural context of the time, signals were often used in covert operations to ensure the correct person was identified, especially in a crowded or dark setting like the Garden of Gethsemane at night.<p><b>&#8220;The One I kiss is the man;</b><br>A kiss was a common greeting in Jewish culture, symbolizing respect and affection. Judas's use of a kiss as a signal for betrayal is particularly heinous, as it perverts a gesture of friendship into one of treachery. This act highlights the depth of Judas's betrayal, as he uses an intimate gesture to identify Jesus to His enemies. The kiss also serves as a stark contrast to the love and loyalty expected among Jesus's followers.<p><b>arrest Him and lead Him away securely.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to arrest Jesus and lead Him away securely suggests that Judas and the authorities anticipated resistance or an attempt by Jesus's followers to prevent His capture. This reflects the tension and volatility of the situation, as Jesus was a well-known figure with a significant following. The phrase underscores the authorities' desire to ensure Jesus's capture without incident, highlighting their fear of public unrest or a potential uprising. This moment sets in motion the fulfillment of Jesus's own predictions about His suffering and death, as seen in <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a> and <a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver.
