People would go to the housetop for relaxation, prayer, or to escape the heat. This setting indicates urgency, as the housetop was a place of leisure, not of immediate action. The instruction to not return from the housetop underscores the suddenness and seriousness of the situation being described.<p><b>go back inside</b><br>The directive to not go back inside suggests a need for immediate action without delay. In the context of the prophecy about the destruction of Jerusalem, it emphasizes the urgency to flee without hesitation. This reflects the suddenness of the events that would unfold, leaving no time for preparation or gathering belongings.<p><b>to retrieve anything from his house</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility of material possessions in the face of impending disaster. It echoes the biblical theme of prioritizing spiritual readiness over earthly concerns. Similar teachings are found in <a href="/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, where Jesus warns about the coming of the Son of Man, urging believers to focus on spiritual preparedness rather than material security.

The words, therefore, mean that he must flee suddenly, if he would save his life, even though he might lose his goods, he must escape, perhaps by crossing over the parapet of his own housetop, and so from house-top to house-top, until he could find a convenient point for flight into the hill country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Let}</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[no one]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
