This reflects Jesus' authority and intentionality in directing His disciples. The act of making them get into the boat indicates His control over the situation, possibly to protect them from the crowd's messianic fervor (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). Boats were common on the Sea of Galilee, used for fishing and transport, highlighting the disciples' familiarity with this mode of travel.<p><b>and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida</b><br>Bethsaida, meaning "house of fishing," was a town on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was the hometown of several disciples, including Peter, Andrew, and Philip (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>). This instruction to go ahead suggests a planned rendezvous, emphasizing Jesus' foreknowledge and divine planning. The journey to Bethsaida also sets the stage for subsequent miracles and teachings, reinforcing the theme of Jesus' ministry expanding beyond Jewish territories.<p><b>while He dismissed the crowd</b><br>Jesus' decision to dismiss the crowd Himself underscores His compassion and responsibility as a shepherd to His flock. This act also reflects His desire for solitude and prayer, as seen in the following verses. The crowd, having witnessed the miracle of the loaves and fishes, might have been eager to crown Him king, but Jesus' dismissal indicates His rejection of earthly kingship in favor of His spiritual mission. This moment foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice and the nature of His kingdom, which is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who instructs His disciples to get into the boat.

Again and again our Lord crossed this sea to escape the crowds who followed him about, and now wished "to take him by force and make him a king." He desired for a time to be in retirement, in order that he might pray with the greater earnestness, and freedom from interruption. He also wished to make occasion for the miracle which was to follow, namely, the stilling of the tempest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Immediately</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
