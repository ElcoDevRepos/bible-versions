Levi was a tax collector, a profession despised by the Jewish people due to its association with Roman oppression and corruption. By dining at Levi's house, Jesus demonstrates His willingness to associate with those considered outcasts and sinners, challenging social norms and religious expectations. This act foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Gospel, which is extended to all people, regardless of their past or social standing.<p><b>many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples</b><br>The presence of tax collectors and sinners highlights the radical nature of Jesus' ministry. Tax collectors were often viewed as traitors and were socially ostracized. Sinners, in this context, likely refers to those who were not strictly observant of the Jewish law. Jesus' willingness to eat with them signifies acceptance and fellowship, breaking down barriers between the righteous and the unrighteous. This gathering prefigures the Kingdom of God, where all are invited to the table. It also reflects the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where a feast is prepared for all peoples.<p><b>for there were many who followed Him</b><br>The phrase indicates that Jesus' message and actions were attracting a diverse group of followers, not limited to the religious elite or those considered righteous by societal standards. This growing following underscores the transformative power of Jesus' teachings and His ability to reach those marginalized by society. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, where people walking in darkness see a great light, symbolizing the hope and redemption Jesus brings to all who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who came to seek and save the lost.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>Also known as Matthew, a tax collector who became one of Jesus' disciples.

This was the house of Matthew. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10</a>) modestly says, "in <span class="accented">the</span> house," keeping himself as much as possible in the background. St. Luke, with greater fullness, says (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29</a>) that "Levi made him a great feast in his house." From this it appears that Matthew at once marked the occasion of his call by inviting his associates, publicans and sinners, that they too, being won by the example and teaching of Christ, might be led in like manner to follow him. Good is ever diffusive of itself; and Christian love prompts those who have experienced the love of Christ to draw others to the same fountain of mercy. We find <span class="cmt_word">publicans</span> and <span class="cmt_word">sinners</span> constantly associated together; for, although there is nothing necessarily unlawful in the office of a tax-gatherer, yet, since men frequently followed that calling because it offered the opportunity for fraud and extortion, hence the "publicans" were, generally speaking, odious to the Jews, and regarded as nothing better than "sinners." More-over the Jews of old maintained that they were Abraham's seed, and protested that as a people dedicated to God, they ought not to be subject to the Romans, who were Gentiles and idolaters. They considered that it was contrary to the liberty and dignity of the children of God that they should pay tribute to them, a view which increased their prejudice against the tax-gatherers. And indeed this was one main cause of the rebellion of the Jews, which led finally to their overthrow by Titus and Vespasian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
