In the cultural context of the time, the hand was often seen as a symbol of action and agency. Jesus is not advocating for literal self-mutilation but rather illustrating the importance of removing anything from one's life that leads to sin. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and the need for personal holiness (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>).<p><b>It is better for you to enter life crippled</b><br>The term "life" here refers to eternal life, a central theme in Jesus' teachings. Entering life "crippled" suggests that enduring temporary hardships or sacrifices in this world is preferable to losing eternal life. This reflects the biblical principle that spiritual well-being is more important than physical wholeness. The idea of entering life with impairments underscores the value of eternal life over earthly concerns (<a href="/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8-9</a>).<p><b>than to have two hands and go into hell</b><br>The word "hell" translates to "Gehenna," a term derived from the Valley of Hinnom near Jerusalem, which was associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By Jesus' time, it had become a metaphor for divine judgment and eternal punishment. This phrase highlights the reality of hell as a place of separation from God, reinforcing the urgency of avoiding sin.<p><b>into the unquenchable fire.</b><br>The "unquenchable fire" symbolizes the eternal nature of divine judgment. Fire is often used in Scripture to represent purification and judgment (<a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). This imagery serves as a stark warning of the consequences of sin and the importance of seeking righteousness.

Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnom, lay to the south of Jerusalem. Originally a pleasant suburb of the city, it became in later times the scene of the worship of Molech, "the abomination of the children of Ammon." On this account the valley was polluted by King Josiah. It thus became the receptacle of everything that was vile and filthy. These noisome accumulations were from time to time consumed by fire; and the things which were not consumed by fire were the prey of worms. Hence "Gehenna" became the image of the place of eternal punishment, where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched." These terrible images are conclusive as to the eternity of future punishment, so far as our nature is concerned and our knowledge reaches. They are the symbols of certain dreadful realities; too dreadful for human language to describe or human thought to conceive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
