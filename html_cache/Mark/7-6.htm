This response is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' authority and willingness to confront religious leaders. It reflects His role as a teacher and prophet, similar to the Old Testament prophets who often challenged the religious status quo.<p><b>Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites</b><br>Jesus references the prophet Isaiah, specifically <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, to highlight the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes. This connection to Isaiah underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that the issues of the heart were present in Israel's history and continue in Jesus' time. The term "hypocrites" is used to describe those who outwardly appear righteous but are inwardly corrupt, a theme prevalent in Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>).<p><b>as it is written</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority of Scripture. Jesus often uses "it is written" to affirm the divine inspiration and enduring relevance of the Old Testament. By doing so, He validates the prophetic words of Isaiah and applies them to the current situation, showing that God's Word transcends time and culture.<p><b>&#8216;These people honor Me with their lips</b><br>This part of the prophecy highlights the superficial nature of the Pharisees' worship. They perform religious rituals and speak words of devotion, but their actions are not matched by genuine faith or obedience. This critique is consistent with other biblical passages that emphasize the importance of sincerity in worship, such as <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> and <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>.<p><b>but their hearts are far from Me</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This phrase indicates a disconnect between external religious practices and internal devotion. It echoes the biblical theme that God desires a relationship with His people that is heartfelt and genuine, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>.

But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.</span> The prophet here gives the cause of the blindness of the Jews, because they honored God with their lips, while their heart was far from him; and their worship of him (for that is the meaning of "their fear") was the commandment of men, which they had been taught; that is, they worshipped God, not according to that spiritual worship which he had commanded, but after the traditions of men and of their own scribes, partly futile, partly perverse, and contrary to God's Law. So he says, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you.

Not that the prophet had the hypocrites of our Saviour's time in his mind when he uttered these words, but that the Spirit of God which was within him enabled him to describe accurately the character of those who seven centuries afterwards would be doing the same things as their forefathers. And observe how they were punished. For as they gave a lip-service only to God, praising him with their mouth indeed, but giving their heart to vanity and the world; so God on his part would give them the words only - the shell, so to speak, the letter which killeth; but take away from them the kernel the spirit and the life, so that they might not lay hold of it nor taste it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus answered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
