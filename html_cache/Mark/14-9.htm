In the Gospels, Jesus often uses "truly" or "verily" to underscore the truth and significance of His words. It reflects His authority as the Son of God, who speaks with divine insight and assurance. This introduction signals to the listener that what follows is of great importance and should be heeded carefully.<p><b>wherever the gospel is preached</b><br>This indicates the global scope of the Gospel message. Jesus anticipates the spread of His teachings beyond the Jewish community to all nations, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The early church, as recorded in Acts, exemplifies this expansion, beginning in Jerusalem and reaching to the ends of the earth. The phrase underscores the universality of the Gospel, which transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.<p><b>in all the world</b><br>This phrase highlights the inclusivity and reach of the Gospel. It aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is a light to the nations. The early Christian mission, as seen in the journeys of Paul and other apostles, reflects this global vision. The phrase also anticipates the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where people from every nation worship before the throne of God.<p><b>what she has done</b><br>This refers to the act of the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume, an act of devotion and worship. Her action is a profound expression of love and sacrifice, as she uses something of great value to honor Jesus. This act prefigures the anointing of Jesus' body for burial, highlighting the connection between worship and the acknowledgment of Jesus' impending death and resurrection.<p><b>will also be told in memory of her.</b><br>This promise ensures that the woman's act of devotion will be remembered and honored throughout history. It serves as a testament to the value Jesus places on acts of genuine love and sacrifice. Her story is preserved in the Gospel narrative, fulfilling Jesus' words. This remembrance also serves as an encouragement for believers to offer their own acts of devotion, knowing that such acts are precious in the sight of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who acknowledges and honors the woman's act of devotion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Although unnamed in Mark, she is identified in other Gospels as Mary of Bethany.
