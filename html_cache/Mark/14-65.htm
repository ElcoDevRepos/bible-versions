This act fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the suffering servant is described as being spat upon. It signifies the deep rejection and scorn Jesus faced from the religious leaders and others present.<p><b>They blindfolded Him,</b><br>Blindfolding Jesus was a way to mock His prophetic abilities. In the context of a trial, it was also a method to disorient and further humiliate the accused. This act underscores the irony of the situation, as Jesus, the true prophet, was being mocked for His divine insight.<p><b>struck Him with their fists,</b><br>Physical violence against Jesus highlights the brutality and injustice of the trial. It reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and afflicted. This treatment was illegal according to Jewish law, which prohibited such abuse before a formal conviction.<p><b>and said to Him, &#8220;Prophesy!&#8221;</b><br>The demand for Jesus to prophesy while blindfolded was a form of ridicule, challenging His identity as a prophet. This mockery is deeply ironic, as Jesus had already accurately predicted His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:33-34). Their taunt was a denial of His messianic role and divine knowledge.<p><b>And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.</b><br>The officers, likely temple guards, participated in the abuse, showing the widespread rejection of Jesus. Slapping was a common form of insult and punishment, further emphasizing the dishonor Jesus endured.
