Lepers were required to live outside the community (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). This leper's approach to Jesus demonstrates a bold act of faith, breaking social norms and religious laws. The act of coming to Jesus signifies recognition of His authority and power, contrasting with the typical avoidance of lepers by society.<p><b>begging on his knees</b><br>The posture of kneeling indicates humility and desperation. In the cultural context, kneeling was a sign of respect and submission, often used in prayer or when making a request to someone of higher status. This act underscores the leper's acknowledgment of Jesus' divine authority and his own helplessness. It reflects the biblical theme of approaching God with a humble heart (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;If You are willing</b><br>This phrase highlights the leper's faith in Jesus' ability to heal, while also recognizing Jesus' sovereignty. It shows an understanding that healing is not just about power but also about the will of God. This aligns with the biblical teaching that God's will is paramount (<a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>). The leper's statement is a model of faith that trusts in God's goodness and timing.<p><b>You can make me clean.&#8221;</b><br>The request to be made "clean" rather than just "healed" indicates a desire for both physical healing and ritual purification. In Jewish law, leprosy rendered a person ceremonially unclean, affecting their ability to participate in religious life (Leviticus 14). The leper's request reflects a deeper longing for restoration to community and worship. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of Jesus as the one who purifies and restores (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/leper.htm">Leper</a></b><br>An individual suffering from leprosy, a disease that caused physical suffering and social isolation due to its contagious nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/event.htm">Event</a></b><br>The encounter between Jesus and the leper, highlighting Jesus' compassion and power to heal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_humility.htm">Faith and Humility</a></b><br>The leper's approach to Jesus demonstrates both faith in Jesus' power and humility in his request.

David prays similarly in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, &#8220;Cleanse me with hyssop&#8230; and I will be clean,&#8221; pointing to the ultimate cleansing Jesus provides (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40</a> paints a vivid picture of desperate faith meeting divine compassion. A marginalized leper breaches social rules to approach the approachable Savior, kneels in humble worship, submits to Jesus&#8217; will, and confesses unwavering belief in His power. The verse invites readers to come just as boldly&#8212;recognizing our unclean state, bowing in dependence, trusting Christ&#8217;s willingness, and believing He alone can make us truly clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40-43) And there came a leper.--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1-4</a>. The miracle appears in St. Matthew as following closely on the Sermon on the Mount.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - The healing of the leper is recorded in all the three synoptic Gospels; but St. Mark gives more full details. From St. Matthew we learn that it took place after the sermon on the mount; and yet not at the very close of his missionary circuit, St. Luke (<a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>) says that the diseased man was "full of leprosy" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The disorder was fully developed; it had spread over his whole body; he was leprous from head to foot. This leprosy was designed to be specially typical of the disease of sin. It was not infectious. It was not because it was either infectious or contagious that the leper was bidden under the Jewish Law to wars others off, in the words," Unclean! un-clean!" It was in some cases hereditary. It was a very revolting disease. It was a poisoning of the springs of life. It was a living death. It was incurable by any human art or skill. It was the awful sign of sin reaching unto death; and it was cured, as sin is cured, only by the mercy and favor of God. No wonder, then, that our Lord specially displayed his power over this terrible disease, that he might thus prove his power over the still worse malady of sin. St. Mark here tells us that this leper knelt down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). St. Matthew says (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>) that he "worshipped <span class="accented">him</span>," (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); St. Luke says (<a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>) that "he fell on his face" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). We thus see that the scriptural idea of worship is associated with some lowly posture of the body. But with this worship of the body, the leper offered also the homage of the soul. His prostration of himself before Christ was not merely a rendering of honor to an earthly being; it was a rendering of reverence to a Divine Being. For he does not say to him, "If thou wilt ask of God, he will give it thee;" but he says, "If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." It is as though he said, "I know that thou art of equal power with the Father, and therefore supreme Lord over diseases; so that by thy word alone thou canst remove this leprosy from me. I ask, therefore, that thou wouldst be willing to do this, and then I know that the thing is done." The leper had faith in the Divine power of Christ, partly out of his own inward illumination, and partly by the evidence of the miracles which Christ had already wrought. If thou wilt, thou east. Observe the hypothetic expression, "If thou wilt." He has no doubt as to Christ's power, but the words, "If thou <span class="accented">wilt"</span> show that his desire for healing was controlled by resignation to the will of God. For bodily diseases are often necessary for the health of the soul; and this God knows, though man knows it not.
