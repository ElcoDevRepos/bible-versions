In the context of first-century Jewish culture, such a miraculous healing would have been seen as a direct act of God, as only God could heal with such immediacy. This act demonstrates Jesus' divine authority and power over physical ailments, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>picked up his mat</b><br>The mat symbolizes the man's previous state of paralysis and dependence. By picking it up, the man demonstrates his complete healing and newfound independence. This act also serves as a public testimony to the miracle that has just occurred, as the mat was a visible reminder of his former condition.<p><b>and walked out in front of them all</b><br>Walking out in front of the crowd signifies the public nature of the miracle. It serves as undeniable evidence of Jesus' power and authority. In a culture where public testimony was crucial for establishing truth, this act would have left a lasting impression on all witnesses, reinforcing the authenticity of the miracle.<p><b>As a result, they were all astounded</b><br>The crowd's astonishment reflects the unprecedented nature of Jesus' miracles. In the Jewish tradition, miracles were often associated with prophets, but the scale and immediacy of Jesus' works set Him apart. This reaction underscores the divine authority with which Jesus operated, challenging the religious leaders' understanding of God's work.<p><b>and glorified God</b><br>The glorification of God by the crowd indicates their recognition of the divine source of Jesus' power. In Jewish culture, giving glory to God was a way of acknowledging His sovereignty and involvement in human affairs. This response aligns with the purpose of Jesus' miracles, which was to reveal God's kingdom and lead people to worship Him.<p><b>saying, &#8220;We have never seen anything like this!&#8221;</b><br>This exclamation highlights the uniqueness of Jesus' ministry. The crowd's acknowledgment of the unprecedented nature of the miracle points to the new era that Jesus was inaugurating.

There is a spiritual application of this miracle which it is well to notice. The paralytic lifting up himself is a figure of him who, in the strength of Christ, has lifted himself up from the lethargy of sin. He has first applied to Christ, perhaps by his own sense of his need, perhaps with the help of others. He may have had difficulty in approaching him. A multitude of sinful thoughts and cares may have thronged the door. But at length, whether alone or with the kind assistance of faithful friends, he has been brought to the feet of Jesus, and has heard those words of love and power, "Thy sins are forgiven thee." And then he will rise and walk. He will take up that whereon he lay. He will carry away those things whereon he has hitherto found satisfaction - his love of ease, his self-indulgence. His bed, whatever it may have been whereon he lay, becomes the proof of his cure. When the intemperate man becomes sober, the passionate man gentle, and the covetous man liberal, he takes up that whereon he lay. Thus does each penitent man begin a new life; setting forward with new hopes and new powers towards his true home, eternal in the heavens. We are not informed of the effect of this miracle upon the scribes and Pharisees. But it is too evident that, though they could not deny the fact, they would not acknowledge the power; while the mass of the people, more free from prejudice, and therefore more open to conviction, united in giving glory to God. Faith in Christ as sent by God was in fact increasing amongst the mass of the people; while unbelief was working its deadly result of envy and malice amongst those who ought to have been their guides and instructors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">immediately</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
