It implies that the religious leaders, who prided themselves on their knowledge of the Scriptures, have overlooked or misunderstood a crucial prophecy. This question challenges their authority and understanding, urging them to reconsider their interpretation of the texts.<p><b>&#8216;The stone the builders rejected:</b><br>This part of the verse refers to <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, a messianic prophecy. In the context of ancient construction, builders would select stones for their suitability. The "rejected" stone symbolizes Jesus, whom the religious leaders (the builders) dismissed as unsuitable for their expectations of the Messiah. Historically, this rejection is seen in the opposition Jesus faced from the Jewish leaders, culminating in His crucifixion.<p><b>has become the cornerstone:</b><br>The cornerstone is the most important stone in a building's foundation, ensuring the structure's stability and alignment. In biblical typology, Jesus is the cornerstone of the Church, the foundation upon which believers are built (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). This transformation from rejected stone to cornerstone signifies Jesus' resurrection and exaltation, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.
