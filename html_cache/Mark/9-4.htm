Elijah represents the prophets, while Moses represents the Law. Their appearance signifies the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in Jesus Christ. Elijah, who was taken up to heaven without dying (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), and Moses, who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, both had unique experiences with God on mountains, paralleling this event on the Mount of Transfiguration. Their presence underscores the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>talking with Jesus</b><br>The conversation between Jesus, Elijah, and Moses is not detailed in the text, but it is significant that they are speaking with Jesus. This indicates that Jesus is the central figure in God's redemptive plan. The presence of these two figures, who had direct encounters with God, highlights Jesus' divine authority and mission. This moment foreshadows Jesus' fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, as He is the culmination of both.

The disciples&#8217; eyewitness account invites every reader to trust the One who unites Law, Prophets, and Gospel in Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses</span>. Moses and Elijah were there because Moses was the lawgiver of the old covenant, and Elijah was conspicuous among the prophets; so that they were the representatives, the one of the Law, and the other of the "goodly fellowship of the prophets. They appear together to bear witness to Christ as the true Messiah, the Savior of the world, prefigured in the Law, and foretold by the prophets. They appear to bear witness to him, and then to resign their offices to the great Lawgiver and Prophet whom they foreshadowed. Then, further, Moses died, but Elijah was translated. Moses, therefore, represents the dead saints who shall rise from their graves and come forth at his coming, while Elijah represents those who shall be found alive at his advent. Our Lord brought with him, at his transfiguration, Moses who had died, and Elijah who had been translated, that he might show his power over both "the quick and the dead." St. <a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a> says that Moses and Elijah "appeared in glory, and spake of his decease (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) which he should accomplish at Jerusalem." They appeared in glory; the Divine splendor irradiated them. They "spake of his decease," literally, <span class="accented">his departure</span> - his departure not only out of Jerusalem, but out of this life, by his death upon the cross. The death of Christ was thus shown to be the ultimate end to which the Law and the prophets pointed. Even in that hour of his glory, on the Mount of Transfiguration, this was their theme; and thus the disciples were nerved to look with hope and faith to that which they had contemplated with dismay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Elijah</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7976;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;lias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2243.htm">Strong's 2243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah, the prophet.
