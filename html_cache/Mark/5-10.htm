In the Gospels, demons often acknowledge Jesus' divine power and authority, which contrasts with the disbelief of many humans. The repeated begging indicates the demons' fear of being cast out and their recognition of Jesus' power over them. This aligns with <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>, where even demons believe in God and shudder.<p><b>not to send them out</b><br>The demons' request not to be sent out reflects their desire to remain in a familiar territory. In Jewish thought, demons were often associated with specific locations or regions. This request underscores the spiritual battle taking place and the demons' understanding of their limitations under Jesus' authority. It also highlights the spiritual reality of territorial spirits, which is a theme seen in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, where a spiritual being is associated with a specific region.<p><b>of that region</b><br>The region referred to is the area of the Gerasenes, located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. This area was predominantly Gentile, which is significant as it shows Jesus' ministry extending beyond Jewish territories. The presence of a large herd of pigs, considered unclean animals in Jewish law, further indicates the Gentile nature of the region. This setting provides a backdrop for Jesus' power and authority being recognized and feared by spiritual forces, regardless of geographical or cultural boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches with authority.

A legion of demons inside one tormented man recognizes that the Son of God stands before them. Their first move is not attack but appeal, because they know His authority is absolute. We watch supernatural beings bow before Jesus just as unclean spirits did earlier in the synagogue&#8212;&#8220;I know who You are&#8212;the Holy One of God!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>). James reminds us, &#8220;Even the demons believe&#8212;and shudder!&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>). The begging underscores that, in the spiritual realm, Christ&#8217;s word is final.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus</b><p>Mark points us to the Person in charge. Jesus, &#8220;the Christ, the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>), is Creator and Judge (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>). The demons don&#8217;t haggle with the disciples; they go straight to the One who owns all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). This moment showcases both His sovereign power and His willingness to confront evil on behalf of a single, broken man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>repeatedly</b><p>Mark emphasizes persistence&#8212;&#8220;he begged Jesus repeatedly.&#8221; Luke records the same urgency: they &#8220;begged Him not to command them to depart into the abyss&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>). Repetition highlights desperation. The spirits know the clock is ticking toward their final judgment (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), yet they frantically try to delay the inevitable. Every fresh plea only reinforces Christ&#8217;s supremacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not to send them</b><p>These spirits possess no freedom apart from divine permission. Earlier encounters show the same pattern: &#8220;Have You come here to torment us before the appointed time?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>). Demons understand that God sets the boundaries of their activity (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; 2:6). Their request exposes fear of immediate confinement and confirms that even dark powers operate only under God&#8217;s leash.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>out of that region</b><p>Why cling to that particular territory? Scripture hints at geographic assignments in the unseen realm (<a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The Gerasene area, steeped in Gentile practices and herding swine, offered them a foothold. Being expelled would leave them wandering, searching for &#8220;rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>), or worse, thrust into the abyss. The location matters to them, but Jesus&#8217; concern centers on the man&#8217;s deliverance, revealing His compassion across cultural lines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-10.htm">Mark 5:10</a> paints a vivid picture of spiritual reality: demons tremble before the living Christ, begging for mercy they do not grant others. Every phrase underscores Jesus&#8217; unrivaled authority and loving intent. Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we can rest in the same power that liberated the Gerasene man. Evil has limits; Jesus has none.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">He besought him much that he would not send them.</span>--The words are singularly significant of the state of the demoniac as half-conscious of his own personal being, and half-identifying himself with the disturbing demoniac forces which were tormenting him, and yet in so doing were leading him to look on the great Healer as his tormentor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country</span>. It would appear as though this evil spirit felt (speaking in the name of the other evil spirits) that if they were driven out from their present dwelling-places, their condition would be changed for the worse; and that until the time should come when they were to be cast into the abyss, their best relief was to possess some materialism, to occupy flesh and blood, and that flesh and blood tenanted by a spiritual being, through whom they might torment others. They could find no rest, no relief, but in this. "The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not" (<a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>). Even the swine were better than nothing; but that dwelling did not serve the evil spirits long. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he begged</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(parekalei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3870.htm">Strong's 3870: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and kaleo; to call near, i.e. Invite, invoke.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
