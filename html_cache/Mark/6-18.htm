His role as a prophet was to call people to repentance and prepare the way for Jesus Christ. In this context, John was addressing Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Herod was a ruler under Roman authority, known for his moral and political compromises. John's confrontation with Herod highlights the prophetic tradition of holding leaders accountable to God's laws, reminiscent of prophets like Nathan confronting King David (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;It is not lawful for you</b><br>John's statement refers to the Jewish law, which Herod, though a ruler in a Roman context, was expected to respect due to his Jewish heritage. The law in question is found in <a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16 and 20</a>:21, which prohibits a man from marrying his brother's wife while the brother is still alive. This reflects the broader biblical principle of upholding the sanctity of marriage and family as ordained by God.<p><b>to have your brother&#8217;s wife!&#8221;</b><br>Herod had married Herodias, who was previously married to his brother Philip. This marriage was considered adulterous and unlawful according to Jewish law. Herodias's ambition and Herod's moral weakness led to this union, which was scandalous and controversial. This situation is a vivid example of the moral decay and political intrigue that characterized Herod's reign. It also foreshadows the eventual martyrdom of John the Baptist, as Herodias harbored a grudge against John for his condemnation, leading to his imprisonment and execution (<a href="/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19-29</a>).

We learn from St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>) that Herod would have killed John before, but he feared the people. Here St. Mark says <span class="cmt_word">that Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; for Herod feared John</span>. There is no contradiction between the two evangelists. The case appears to have been this: that at first Herod desired to put John to death, because John had reproved him on account of Herodias. But by degrees John gained an influence over Herod by the force of his character, and by his holy life and teaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
