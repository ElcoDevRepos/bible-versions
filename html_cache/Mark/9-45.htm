In the cultural context of the time, the foot symbolizes one's path or way of life. Jesus is not advocating for literal self-mutilation but rather for the removal of anything in one's life that leads to sin. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and the need for personal holiness (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>). The metaphor of cutting off a foot underscores the radical commitment required to follow Christ.<p><b>It is better for you to enter life lame</b><br>The concept of entering life "lame" suggests that spiritual well-being is more important than physical wholeness. In biblical terms, "life" often refers to eternal life or the kingdom of God. This reflects the teaching that spiritual priorities should outweigh earthly concerns. The idea of entering life with a physical deficiency highlights the value of eternal life over temporary, earthly conditions. This echoes the teachings found in <a href="/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8-9</a>, where similar language is used to stress the importance of prioritizing one's spiritual state.<p><b>than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Gehenna," which refers to the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside Jerusalem associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By the time of Jesus, it had become a symbol of final judgment and eternal punishment. This phrase serves as a stark warning about the consequences of unrepentant sin. The imagery of being "thrown into hell" underscores the severity of divine judgment and the eternal separation from God that results from a life of sin. This teaching is consistent with other New Testament passages that warn of the reality of hell (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the seriousness of sin and the radical measures needed to avoid it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all followers of Christ who are called to live a life of holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hell.htm">Hell (Gehenna)</a></b><br>A place of eternal punishment, used by Jesus to illustrate the severe consequences of sin.
