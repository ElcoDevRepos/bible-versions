In biblical history, it is known for the miraculous conquest by Joshua (Joshua 6). By the time of Jesus, Jericho was a prosperous city, rebuilt by Herod the Great. Its location made it a common stop for pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem, which is significant as Jesus was on His way to the Passover festival.<p><b>And as Jesus and His disciples were leaving Jericho with a large crowd,</b><br>The presence of a large crowd indicates Jesus' growing popularity and the anticipation surrounding His ministry. This journey to Jerusalem is significant as it leads to the events of the Passion Week. The crowd likely included pilgrims heading to Jerusalem for Passover, as well as those curious about Jesus' teachings and miracles.<p><b>a blind beggar named Bartimaeus,</b><br>Blindness was a common affliction in ancient times, often leading to a life of poverty and begging. Bartimaeus' name means "son of Timaeus," which is Aramaic in origin. His condition and position as a beggar highlight the social and economic challenges faced by those with disabilities in the first century.<p><b>the son of Timaeus,</b><br>The repetition of Bartimaeus' lineage emphasizes his identity and personal story. In the cultural context, naming the father was a way to identify individuals, especially in a society where many shared common names. This detail also adds a personal touch to the narrative, making Bartimaeus a relatable figure.<p><b>was sitting beside the road.</b><br>Sitting beside the road was a strategic choice for beggars, as travelers might be more inclined to give alms. Roads leading to major cities like Jerusalem were busy, especially during festival times.

Jericho, situated in the midst of a fertile, well-watered country, celebrated for its palm trees, was situated about seventeen English miles east-north-east of Jerusalem, and about six miles from the nearest bend of the river Jordan. In the time of our Lord it was one of the most important cities next to Jerusalem. It is now known by the name of Richa or Ericha, and is almost deserted. The journey from the Jordan to Jericho is through a fiat country; but that from Jericho to Jerusalem is very hilly. It is supposed that it was upon the rocky heights overhanging this city that our Lord's temptation took place. Jericho derives its name, either from "the moon," or from the fragrant edours of the "balsam" plant, which was extensively cultivated in the neighborhood. Its palm groves and balsam gardens were bestowed by Anthony upon Cleopatra, from whom Herod the Great purchased them. It was here that Herod the Great died. It is now one of the most filthy and neglected places in Palestine. To this place our Lord came; and St. Luke (18 and 19.) gives a full account of his reception there. St. Matthew speaks of two blind men; but he agrees with St. Mark in saying that the cure took place as he went out from Jericho. St. Luke mentions only one; but he places the cure at the time of our Lord's entrance into Jericho. How do we reconcile St. Mark's account of one only, specially named, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus? St. Augustine says that there were two blind men; but that the one, better known, overshadowed the other. He also says that Bartimaeus was a well-known character, and that he was accustomed to sit by the wayside, not only blind, but as a beggar. It is of course possible that St. Luke may refer to another ease altogether. But on the other hand, with the exception that he mentions only one, and that he places the cure at the time of the entrance into Jericho, and not at the time of the departure, all the other circumstances are identical. May not this latter discrepancy be reconciled thus? - the blind man may have sought a cure from Christ at his first entrance into the city; but he may not have been able to be heard on account of the crowd. Or our Lord may have passed him by at first, in order to stimulate his faith and hope. So the day after, he may have placed himself at the gate of the city, close by where Christ would pass through; and there again he may have urged his request, and so obtained healing. Dr. John Lightfoot (p. 348) says that the careful description of Bartimaeus would seem to imply that his father may have been a person of some note. Dr. Lightfoot adds that it is possible that Timaeus, or "Thimai," may be the same with <span class="accented">Simais</span>, blind, from the use of the letter <span class="accented">thau</span> from <span class="accented">samech</span>, common amongst the Chaldaeans; so that Bartimaeus might mean nothing more than "blind son of a blind father." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Next,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchontai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jericho.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#967;&#974;</span> <span class="translit">(Ierich&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2410.htm">Strong's 2410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jericho, a city a little north of the Dead Sea.
