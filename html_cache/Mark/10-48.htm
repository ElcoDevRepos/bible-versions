The crowd following Him is likely a mix of His disciples, other followers, and curious onlookers. The man being admonished is Bartimaeus, a blind beggar. In the cultural context of the time, beggars were often marginalized and seen as a nuisance. The crowd's attempt to silence him reflects societal norms that devalued the voices of those considered lowly or unimportant. This moment highlights the tension between societal expectations and the radical inclusivity of Jesus' ministry, which often uplifted the marginalized.<p><b>but he cried out all the louder</b><br>Bartimaeus' persistence in crying out despite being rebuked demonstrates his desperation and faith. His determination can be seen as a model of faith that refuses to be silenced by societal pressures or discouragement. This act of crying out louder signifies a deep recognition of his need for Jesus and an unwavering belief that Jesus can meet that need. It also reflects the biblical theme of perseverance in faith, as seen in other scriptures like the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221;</b><br>The title "Son of David" is a messianic title, acknowledging Jesus as the promised descendant of David who would establish God's kingdom. This recognition by Bartimaeus is significant, as it shows his understanding of Jesus' true identity, despite his physical blindness. The plea for mercy is a common biblical expression of seeking divine compassion and help, often used in the Psalms. This request for mercy underscores the humility and faith of Bartimaeus, acknowledging his dependence on Jesus' grace and power. The use of "Son of David" connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1-10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, which speak of a righteous branch from David's line who will bring justice and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bartimaeus.htm">Bartimaeus</a></b><br>A blind beggar sitting by the roadside in Jericho.

The crowd&#8212;perhaps eager for a neat, orderly procession with Jesus&#8212;tries to hush the &#8220;distraction.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear when disciples rebuke parents bringing children to Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>) and when people scold the woman who anoints Him (<a href="/mark/14-4.htm">Mark 14:4-5</a>). Their common thread: human attempts to limit access to Christ.<p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s parallel account confirms the same reaction (<a href="/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>), underscoring that resistance to bold faith is no one-off event.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that popular opinion can clash with God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The lesson? Expect pushback when you pursue Jesus with urgency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he cried out all the louder</b><p>&#8226; Bartimaeus refuses to let the crowd dictate his destiny. Rather than shrinking, he amplifies his plea&#8212;an act of determined faith.<p>&#8226; This persistence recalls the Canaanite woman who kept imploring Jesus until He acknowledged her faith (<a href="/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22-28</a>) and the widow who wears down the unjust judge (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> invites every believer to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8221;&#8212;exactly what Bartimaeus models.<p>&#8226; Genuine desperation plus unwavering trust often sets the stage for divine intervention (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Son of David</b><p>&#8226; By this messianic title, Bartimaeus confesses what many sighted onlookers still miss: Jesus is the promised King from David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Mark&#8217;s Gospel opens by calling Jesus &#8220;the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) and now a blind beggar proclaims Him &#8220;Son of David,&#8221; publicly linking Jesus to covenant promises.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a> celebrates the same lineage&#8212;&#8220;the Root of David has triumphed.&#8221; Bartimaeus&#8217; cry is a flash of prophetic clarity amid physical darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have mercy on me!</b><p>&#8226; Mercy is the beggar&#8217;s only currency. He doesn&#8217;t plead merit, status, or bargaining chips&#8212;just the compassionate heart of Christ.<p>&#8226; Similar words arise from the tax collector in Jesus&#8217; parable: &#8220;God, be merciful to me, a sinner&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>). Both men leave justified.<p>&#8226; Mercy is God&#8217;s consistent posture toward the helpless (<a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking for mercy rather than simply for sight, Bartimaeus seeks relationship as well as remedy. His physical healing (<a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>) flows from a deeper spiritual transaction: faith meeting grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Crowd pressure tries to muffle desperate faith, yet Bartimaeus doubles down. He addresses Jesus with the loaded title &#8220;Son of David,&#8221; acknowledging Messiahship, and places absolute trust in divine mercy. <a href="/mark/10-48.htm">Mark 10:48</a> therefore spotlights persistent faith that refuses to be silenced, recognizes Jesus as the promised King, and humbly appeals to His unfailing compassion&#8212;a pattern every believer can follow when seeking the Lord&#8217;s help today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many rebuked him, that he should hold his</span> <span class="cmt_word">peace.</span> They rebuked him, perhaps, out of reverence and regard for Christ, who might perhaps at that moment have been preaching to the people, and so might be disturbed by the blind man's loud and noisy appeal.

He was in good earnest, and would not be restrained. A useful lesson is hem suggested to all.
