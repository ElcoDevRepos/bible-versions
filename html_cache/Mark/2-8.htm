In the Gospels, Jesus often demonstrates knowledge beyond human capacity, affirming His identity as the Son of God. This immediate awareness also reflects the intimate connection between Jesus and the Holy Spirit, as seen in other instances like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, where Jesus knows what is in a person's heart.<p><b>that they were thinking this way within themselves.</b><br>The context here involves the scribes questioning Jesus' authority to forgive sins, which they considered blasphemous. This internal dialogue among the scribes reveals their skepticism and hardness of heart. The phrase underscores the biblical theme that God knows the thoughts and intentions of the heart, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a> and <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?&#8221; He asked.</b><br>Jesus' question serves as a direct challenge to the scribes' unbelief and a call to self-examination. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of human will and emotion. By addressing their hearts, Jesus points to the deeper issue of spiritual blindness and resistance to truth. This confrontation is consistent with prophetic calls to repentance found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God critiques those who honor Him with their lips but have hearts far from Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is demonstrating His divine knowledge and authority by perceiving the thoughts of the scribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders and experts in the Jewish law who were questioning Jesus' authority and actions internally.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, often serving as a base for Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paralytic_man.htm">Paralytic Man</a></b><br>The individual whose healing prompted the internal questioning by the scribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>The setting of the event, likely a private home in Capernaum where Jesus was teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_insight.htm">Divine Insight</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to perceive thoughts demonstrates His divine nature and omniscience.

At all events, their words were evidently not heard beyond themselves. But Jesus perceived in his spirit their reasonings. He knew their thoughts, not by communication from another, as the prophets of old had things made known to them by revelation, but by his own Spirit pervading and penetrating all things. From this the Christian Fathers, against the Arians, infer the divinity of Christ, that he inspected the heart, which it is the prerogative of God alone to do. St. Chrysostom says, "Behold the evidences of the divinity of Christ. Observe that he knows the very secrets of your heart." Nor did Christ only perceive their thoughts. He perceived also the direction in which these thoughts were moving. Their feeling was no doubt this: "It is an easy thing to claim the power of forgiving sin, since this is a power which cannot be challenged by any outward sign." Now, it is to this form of unbelief that the next words of our Lord are the answer. It is as though he said, "You accuse me of blasphemy. You say that I am usurping the attributes of God when I claim the power of forgiving sin. You ask for the evidence that I really possess this power; and you say it is an easy thing to lay claim to a power which penetrates the spiritual world, and which is therefore beyond the reach of material proof. Be it so. I will now furnish that evidence. I will prove, by what I am now about to work upon the body, that what I have just said is effectual upon the spirit. I have just said to this paralytic, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' You challenge this power; you question my authority. I will now give you outward and sensible evidence that this is no fictitious or imaginary claim. You see this poor helpless, palsied man. I will say to him in presence of you all, ' Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.' And if simply at my bidding his nerves are braced, and his limbs gather strength, and he rises and walks, then judge ye whether I have a right to say to him, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' Thus, by doing that which is capable of proof, I will vindicate my power to do that which is beyond the reach of sensible evidence; and I will make manifest to you, by these visible tides of my grace, in what direction the deep under-current of my love is moving."
