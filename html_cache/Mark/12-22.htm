This law was intended to preserve a family line and inheritance within Israel. The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, used this scenario to challenge Jesus on the concept of life after death. The fact that none of the brothers left children emphasizes the futility of their earthly efforts and sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the eternal nature of the resurrection. This also highlights the cultural importance of lineage and inheritance in Jewish society, where having descendants was seen as a blessing and a means of continuing one's name and legacy.<p><b>And last of all, the woman died.</b><br>The death of the woman concludes the Sadducees' story, underscoring the finality of death from a human perspective. In the context of the narrative, her death serves to question whose wife she would be in the resurrection, according to the Sadducees' understanding. This reflects the limited human perspective on life and death, which Jesus addresses by pointing to the eternal nature of the resurrection. Theologically, this phrase sets the stage for Jesus to reveal deeper truths about life after death, where earthly relationships and social constructs do not bind individuals. It also subtly points to the transient nature of earthly life and the hope of eternal life, a theme consistent with the teachings of Jesus throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sadducees.htm">The Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who posed the question to Jesus to challenge Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>A hypothetical scenario presented by the Sadducees, where each brother marries the same woman in succession after the previous one dies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Central to the Sadducees' question, she marries each brother and eventually dies without bearing children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The teacher and central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is being questioned by the Sadducees.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, where Jesus is teaching in the temple courts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>The Sadducees' question reveals their misunderstanding of the resurrection.

They have carefully stacked their example to emphasize an earthly dilemma they believe will expose flaws in the doctrine of resurrection. By repeating the same pattern seven times, they underline how thorough&#8212;and seemingly unanswerable&#8212;their puzzle is. Their intent is not genuine curiosity but a challenge to Jesus, since the Sadducees deny any resurrection at all (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>None of the seven left any children</b><p>This phrase highlights total barrenness despite every legal effort to secure a descendant. In Scripture, childlessness is often portrayed as a significant loss (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2-3</a>; <a href="/job/18-19.htm">Job 18:19</a>) and, in the levirate context, a problem the law sought to remedy (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>). By insisting that &#8220;none of the seven left any children,&#8221; the Sadducees reinforce their &#8220;no-loophole&#8221; scenario. Every personal and legal avenue has failed; there is no surviving heir, no ongoing earthly legacy, nothing to complicate their main question about marital identity in the resurrection (<a href="/luke/20-31.htm">Luke 20:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And last of all</b><p>The story reaches its final stage. &#8220;Last of all&#8221; shifts attention away from the brothers and back to the woman. It also hints at finality: nothing further can be done on earth. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a> reminds us there is &#8220;a time to be born and a time to die,&#8221; while <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> notes that people are &#8220;appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221; By exhausting every earthly option, the Sadducees set the stage for Jesus to move the discussion to eternal realities (<a href="/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The woman died</b><p>With her death, every participant in the scenario has entered the grave (<a href="/luke/20-32.htm">Luke 20:32</a>). The Sadducees&#8217; ultimate aim is to press Jesus on whose wife she will be &#8220;at the resurrection&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-23.htm">Mark 12:23</a>). Their assumption is that post-resurrection life must mirror earthly institutions like marriage. Jesus will refute that by affirming both the resurrection and a transformed order where people &#8220;neither marry nor are given in marriage&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-25.htm">Mark 12:25</a>; cf. <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The woman&#8217;s death, therefore, is not the end but the pivot point for Jesus to reveal the power of God and the fidelity of Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-22.htm">Mark 12:22</a> completes the Sadducees&#8217; carefully constructed scenario: seven brothers, no offspring, and finally the woman herself dies. Their intention is to discredit belief in the resurrection by portraying an impossible marital tangle. Jesus will soon answer that earthly institutions cannot limit God&#8217;s power or define eternal life. The verse underscores human inability to secure legacy or solve ultimate questions apart from God, and it sets up Jesus&#8217; authoritative teaching that resurrection is real, that Scripture is reliable, and that life to come will far surpass present arrangements.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In this way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">none</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
