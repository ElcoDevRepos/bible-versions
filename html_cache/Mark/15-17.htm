By dressing Jesus in a purple robe, the Roman soldiers were mocking His claim to kingship, as purple was a color worn by emperors and high-ranking officials. This act of mockery fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was despised and rejected by men. The robe symbolizes the irony of Jesus' true kingship, as He is the King of Kings, yet He is being ridiculed as a false king.<p><b>twisted together a crown of thorns</b><br>The crown of thorns was a cruel parody of a royal crown, intended to inflict pain and humiliation. Thorns are a symbol of the curse of sin from <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, where the ground was cursed to produce thorns and thistles. By wearing this crown, Jesus symbolically bore the curse of sin on behalf of humanity. This act also connects to the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the suffering and scorn the Messiah would endure. The crown of thorns highlights the suffering servant aspect of Jesus' mission, as He takes on the suffering and shame of the world.<p><b>and set it on His head</b><br>Placing the crown on Jesus' head was the culmination of the soldiers' mockery, as they sarcastically hailed Him as "King of the Jews." This act of setting the crown on His head is significant because it parallels the anointing of kings in the Old Testament, such as the anointing of David in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>. However, instead of anointing with oil, Jesus is crowned with thorns, emphasizing His role as the suffering King. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of Jesus, who, despite the mockery and suffering, will be exalted and recognized as the true King in His resurrection and second coming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being mocked and prepared for crucifixion in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The individuals who mock Jesus by dressing Him in a purple robe and placing a crown of thorns on His head, symbolizing a mock coronation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crown_of_thorns.htm">Crown of Thorns</a></b><br>A painful and humiliating symbol of mockery, representing the suffering and shame Jesus endured.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purple_robe.htm">Purple Robe</a></b><br>A garment symbolizing royalty, used here to mock Jesus' claim to kingship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/praetorium.htm">Praetorium</a></b><br>The governor's headquarters where Jesus was taken to be mocked and beaten by the soldiers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humiliation_of_christ.htm">The Humiliation of Christ</a></b><br>Reflect on the depth of humiliation Jesus willingly endured for our sake.

St. Matthew says (<a href="/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28</a>), "They put on him a scarlet robe (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Purple and scarlet are not such very dissimilar colors. Purple is a royal color; and the <span class="accented">chlamys</span> of St. Matthew was a short military cloak of scarlet, intended to be a kind of royal livery. St. Cyril says that the purple cloak symbolized the kingdom of the whole world, which Christ was about to receive, and which he was to obtain by the shedding of his most precious blood. It was designed in mockery of his claim to be a King, and it probably bad a reference to his supposed insurrection against Caesar. All this was permitted by Pilate, in order that he might the more easily, after this ignominious treatment, deliver Christ from the extreme sentence. <span class="accented">And plaiting a crown of thorns</span>, <span class="accented">they put it on him.</span> The crown of thorns was in all probability woven from the <span class="accented">Zizyphus spina Christi</span> (the <span class="accented">nabk</span> of the Arabs), which grows abundantly in Palestine, fringing the banks of the Jordan. This plant would be very suitable for the purpose, having flexible branches, with leaves very much resembling the ivy leaf in their color, and with many sharp thorns. The pain arising from the pressure of these sharp thorns upon the head must have been excruciating. <span class="accented">And they began to salute him</span>, <span class="accented">Hail</span>, <span class="accented">King of the Jews!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).
