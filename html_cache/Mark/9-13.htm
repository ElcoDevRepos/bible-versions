In the context of the New Testament, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the "Elijah" who was to come (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>, <a href="/mark/9-11.htm">Mark 9:11-13</a>). John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, preparing the way for Jesus, fulfilling the role of the forerunner as prophesied. This connection emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and highlights the fulfillment of prophecy in the person of John the Baptist.<p><b>and they have done to him whatever they wished</b><br>This phrase indicates the suffering and rejection that John the Baptist faced, paralleling the experiences of many prophets in Israel's history. John was imprisoned and eventually executed by Herod Antipas (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-29</a>), reflecting the pattern of persecution faced by God's messengers. This treatment of John the Baptist serves as a foreshadowing of the suffering and rejection that Jesus Himself would endure. It underscores the theme of the cost of discipleship and the opposition faced by those who proclaim God's truth.<p><b>just as it is written about him.</b><br>This phrase suggests that the events surrounding John the Baptist's life and death were in accordance with scriptural prophecy and divine foreknowledge. While there is no specific Old Testament scripture that explicitly details John's fate, the general pattern of rejection and suffering of prophets is well-documented (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>).
