Their selection underscores their unique role and the trust Jesus placed in them. This trio represents the leadership within the early church, with Peter often seen as the spokesperson, James as the first apostolic martyr (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), and John as the beloved disciple who would later write the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation. Their presence here emphasizes the gravity of the moment and the need for witnesses to Jesus' profound experiences.<p><b>and began to be deeply troubled and distressed</b><br>This phrase captures the intense emotional and spiritual turmoil Jesus faced as He approached His crucifixion. The Greek words used here convey a sense of horror and anguish, indicating the depth of His suffering. This moment in the Garden of Gethsemane reveals Jesus' humanity, as He experiences dread and sorrow, yet it also foreshadows His obedience to the Father's will. The distress He feels is not just physical anticipation of the crucifixion but also the spiritual burden of bearing the sins of the world. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief." Jesus' distress also fulfills the typology of the suffering servant, highlighting His role as the sacrificial Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing for His impending crucifixion.
