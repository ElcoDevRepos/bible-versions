The question "What is your name?" is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' authority over the spiritual realm. In ancient Jewish culture, knowing the name of a spirit was believed to give one power over it. This encounter takes place in the region of the Gerasenes, a predominantly Gentile area, highlighting Jesus' ministry extending beyond Jewish boundaries. The question also serves to reveal the nature and extent of the possession, setting the stage for the miraculous deliverance that follows.<p><b>&#8220;My name is Legion,&#8221; he replied,</b><br>The response "My name is Legion" indicates the severity of the man's condition. A Roman legion typically consisted of about 6,000 soldiers, suggesting the man was possessed by a multitude of demons. This reflects the overwhelming spiritual oppression he was under. The use of the term "Legion" also evokes the Roman military presence in the region, symbolizing the oppressive forces at work both physically and spiritually. This encounter underscores the power of Jesus over even the most formidable spiritual adversaries.<p><b>&#8220;for we are many.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "for we are many" confirms the multitude of demons inhabiting the man, emphasizing the depth of his torment. This multitude of demons represents the chaotic and destructive nature of evil, contrasting with the order and peace that Jesus brings. The acknowledgment of their number also highlights the comprehensive victory Jesus achieves in delivering the man. This event foreshadows the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's death and resurrection, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches with authority.

In Scripture, names reveal identity and destiny (<a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13-14</a>). By asking, the Lord:<p>&#8226; Draws the darkness into the light&#8212;demons must expose themselves when the Savior speaks (<a href="/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Signals personal confrontation; nothing about this deliverance is mechanical. It is relational, precise, and intentional (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Affirms that every bondage has a specific root, and He knows how to address it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus asked.</b><p>The authority rests entirely with Jesus. Mark repeatedly shows that unclean spirits fall silent or submit when He speaks (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>; 3:11). Here:<p>&#8226; The question is not for His information but for the sake of the tormented man and the witnesses.<p>&#8226; The very act of asking demonstrates that Christ controls the conversation, not the demons (<a href="/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>; <a href="/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; It illustrates the Lord&#8217;s pastoral heart&#8212;He dignifies the man even while addressing the spirits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My name is Legion,</b><p>The reply reveals the scale of oppression. A Roman legion numbered thousands, and the spirit chooses that term to communicate overwhelming force (<a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>). Key insights:<p>&#8226; Darkness loves to intimidate by magnifying its size, yet merely confessing it to Jesus places it under His feet (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The admission uncovers a counterfeit unity&#8212;many spirits acting as one, in contrast to the true unity of the Spirit in God&#8217;s people (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in defiance, the demon must answer. Hell&#8217;s armies cannot withhold information when the Master inquires (<a href="/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he replied,</b><p>Though the voice is singular, the speaker represents the multitude within. Notice:<p>&#8226; Demons have no option to remain silent; they must &#8220;reply&#8221; because the Creator&#8217;s word compels response (<a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Their admission is a reluctant confession of Christ&#8217;s supremacy, underscoring that He is &#8220;far above all rule and authority&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment confirms that spiritual warfare is not a battle of equals; Jesus commands, and the enemy reacts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for we are many.</b><p>The full disclosure exposes the depth of possession but also sets the stage for complete liberation (<a href="/mark/5-10.htm">Mark 5:10-13</a>). Truths to note:<p>&#8226; Quantity of demons never equals superiority over Christ; &#8220;Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underscores the man&#8217;s helplessness apart from divine intervention, reminding us that salvation is entirely of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights the reality of multiple, organized evil forces (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>) yet simultaneously displays their collective submission to a single command from Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a> reveals that when Jesus confronts evil, He does so with personal authority, piercing questions, and sovereign control. The demons&#8217; admission of being &#8220;Legion&#8230; many&#8221; magnifies not their power but Christ&#8217;s supremacy, for even vast spiritual forces must expose themselves and bow to His word. The verse assures believers that no matter how numerous or intimidating the oppression, the Lord&#8217;s authority is absolute, His deliverance complete, and His heart ever focused on restoring the one who is bound.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
