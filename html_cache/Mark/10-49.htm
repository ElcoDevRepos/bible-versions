In the context of <a href="/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a>, Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem, where He will face crucifixion. Despite the pressing journey, He pauses to address the needs of a blind man, Bartimaeus. This act reflects the nature of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing His attention to individuals and their faith. The act of stopping signifies the importance of the individual in the eyes of Jesus, aligning with His teachings that the last shall be first (<a href="/mark/10-31.htm">Mark 10:31</a>). It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who will open the eyes of the blind.<p><b>So they called the blind man.</b><br>The crowd, initially rebuking Bartimaeus for calling out to Jesus, now becomes the conduit for his healing. This shift demonstrates the transformative power of Jesus' presence and command. The crowd's change in behavior can be seen as a reflection of societal norms being challenged by Jesus' teachings. In a broader biblical context, this moment echoes the call of God to His people, as seen in the Old Testament, where God often calls individuals to step out in faith (e.g., Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Take courage!&#8221; they said.</b><br>The encouragement given to Bartimaeus is significant. In the cultural context of the time, blindness was often seen as a curse or punishment, leading to social ostracism. The words "Take courage!" are a call to faith and hope, resonating with the biblical theme of God encouraging His people in times of fear or uncertainty (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). This phrase also reflects the New Testament theme of courage in the face of adversity, as seen in Jesus' own words to His disciples (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Get up! He is calling for you.&#8221;</b><br>The command to "Get up" signifies a call to action and faith. Bartimaeus is not only being called physically to rise but also spiritually to respond to Jesus' invitation. This mirrors other biblical instances where individuals are called to rise and follow God's direction, such as the call of the disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The phrase "He is calling for you" underscores the personal nature of Jesus' ministry. It highlights the individual call to each believer, reminiscent of the Good Shepherd calling His sheep by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>). This personal call is a central theme in the Christian faith, emphasizing a direct relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/blind_bartimaeus.htm">Blind Bartimaeus</a></b><br>A blind beggar sitting by the roadside, who calls out to Jesus for mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people following Jesus, initially rebuking Bartimaeus but later encouraging him at Jesus' command.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location in both Old and New Testament accounts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle.htm">The Miracle</a></b><br>The healing of Bartimaeus, which demonstrates Jesus' compassion and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistent_faith.htm">The Power of Persistent Faith</a></b><br>Bartimaeus' persistence in calling out to Jesus despite the crowd's rebuke is a model of unwavering faith.

His pause is deliberate, showing that He is never too busy to hear the cry of faith (<a href="/mark/10-47.htm">Mark 10:47-48</a>). Similar moments appear when He &#8220;stood still&#8221; for the widow&#8217;s dead son (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>) and when He &#8220;stopped&#8221; for the hemorrhaging woman (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30-34</a>). Each instance reveals His heart: personal compassion overrides public momentum.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;Call him.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Christ delegates: rather than walking over Himself, He invites the crowd to act.<p>&#8226; The order models how He involves believers in His work, just as He told the servants to fill the jars at Cana (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>) and instructed the disciples to &#8220;give them something to eat&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-37.htm">Mark 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The command also reverses the crowd&#8217;s earlier rebuke of Bartimaeus (<a href="/mark/10-48.htm">Mark 10:48</a>), teaching that true disciples assist, never hinder, seekers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they called the blind man.</b><p>Obedience follows immediately. Those who once silenced him now become messengers of mercy, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>, where even former opponents can be turned to peaceful cooperation when the Lord intervenes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Take courage!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Encouragement replaces discouragement; words that once shut him down now lift him up.<p>&#8226; Similar exhortations appear when Jesus approached the disciples on the stormy sea&#8212;&#8220;Take courage!

Bartimaeus must rise from his stationary position to meet the Savior, echoing Jesus&#8217; earlier words to Jairus&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;Little girl, I say to you, get up!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>). Grace initiates; faith responds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is calling for you.</b><p>&#8226; The invitation is personal: &#8220;for you.&#8221; Just as the good shepherd &#8220;calls his own sheep by name&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>), Jesus singles out one blind beggar in a throng.<p>&#8226; Divine call replaces societal marginalization. Where the crowd saw a nuisance, Christ saw a son destined for sight (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment previews the gospel invitation in <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>&#8212;&#8220;The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a> captures the gospel in miniature. Jesus stops for a desperate cry, involves His followers in mercy, overturns discouragement with courage, demands a faith-filled response, and issues a personal call. The verse reminds believers that our Lord hears, halts, and heals, and that we are invited to partner with Him in bringing the needy straight to His welcoming voice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">And commanded him to be called.</span>--The better MSS. give, more vividly, "and said, Call him."<p><span class= "bld">Be of good comfort.</span>--The cheering words of the disciples or by-standers are given by St. Mark only, as is also the eager action of the man "casting <span class= "ital">off</span> his garment (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the outer mantle) and <span class= "ital">leaping up."</span> The Greek word, in the better MSS. is much stronger than the English "rose."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus stood still</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">Jesus stood</span> - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Call ye him</span>.
