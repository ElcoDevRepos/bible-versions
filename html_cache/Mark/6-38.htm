This directive emphasizes the importance of recognizing and utilizing what is available, even when it seems insufficient. The act of going and seeing reflects a practical approach to faith, where human effort and divine intervention work together. This mirrors the Old Testament principle seen in <a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a>, where Elisha asks the widow what she has in her house before performing a miracle. The loaves mentioned here are likely small barley loaves, common in the diet of the poor in first-century Palestine, as indicated in <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>. This setting underscores the humble beginnings of the miracle.<p><b>And after checking, they said, &#8220;Five&#8212;and two fish.&#8221;</b><br>The disciples report back with five loaves and two fish, highlighting the meager resources available to feed such a large crowd. This scarcity sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His divine power and provision, reminiscent of God's provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, while fish were a staple food in Galilee, caught in the Sea of Galilee, a significant location in Jesus' ministry. The two fish may also symbolize the dual nature of Christ's mission to both Jews and Gentiles. This miracle prefigures the Last Supper and the Eucharist, where Jesus provides spiritual sustenance, and it foreshadows the abundance of God's kingdom, as seen in the eschatological banquet described in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who asks the disciples to assess their resources.
