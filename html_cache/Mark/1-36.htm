His companions likely include Andrew, James, and John, who were also called by Jesus early in His ministry. These men were fishermen by trade, indicating their humble beginnings and the diverse backgrounds of Jesus' followers. The mention of "companions" highlights the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry, where discipleship was not a solitary journey but one shared with others.<p><b>went to look for Him</b><br>This phrase indicates a sense of urgency and determination. The disciples were actively seeking Jesus, which reflects their growing dependence on Him and their desire to be in His presence. This search occurs after Jesus had withdrawn to a solitary place to pray, emphasizing the importance of prayer in His ministry. The disciples' search for Jesus can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual pursuit of Christ, a theme echoed throughout the New Testament. It also foreshadows the later mission of the disciples to seek out the lost and bring them to Jesus, aligning with the Great Commission found in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon.htm">Simon (Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' first disciples, originally a fisherman.

Earlier that same day, he had watched Jesus heal his mother-in-law (<a href="/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29-31</a>). From that moment Simon knew the Lord&#8217;s touch personally and felt a new responsibility for Jesus&#8217; ministry.<p>- <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-18</a> records Simon&#8217;s call; <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-20</a> echoes it, showing how immediately he left his nets. That readiness now moves him to action again.<p>- As the natural leader among the Twelve (see <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-18</a>), Simon&#8217;s initiative here sets the tone: when Jesus withdraws, the first instinct of a true disciple is to pursue Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his companions</b><p>- Simon is not alone; Andrew, James, and John (<a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19-20</a>) stand with him. <a href="/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38-42</a> tells the same story and confirms their presence.<p>- The phrase underscores community. Discipleship is never a solo endeavor (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>). These men share life, work, and now the pursuit of their Master.<p>- Their companionship also hints at early unity of purpose (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>). Though they will later differ, in this moment they are one in longing for Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went</b><p>- &#8220;Went&#8221; signals decisive movement. Jesus had risen &#8220;very early, while it was still dark&#8221; to pray in a solitary place (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). The disciples do not linger or debate; they go.<p>- The urgency mirrors other moments of swift obedience, such as the shepherds in <a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15-16</a> and Mary Magdalene in <a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1-2</a>.<p>- Their action illustrates <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>: &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.&#8221; The literal step of walking after Christ pictures the spiritual step of seeking Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to look for Him</b><p>- Their purpose is explicit: to locate Jesus. People in Capernaum are already clamoring for more miracles (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34, 37</a>). The disciples assume Jesus should return to the crowds.<p>- Yet Jesus&#8217; reply in the next verse shifts their focus from popularity to proclamation: &#8220;Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may preach there also&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;look for Him&#8221; invites personal application: <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> promises, &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.&#8221; The disciples&#8217; physical search foreshadows the call for every believer to seek Christ first (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/1-36.htm">Mark 1:36</a> captures a snapshot of early discipleship: Simon, already touched by Jesus, rallies his close friends to pursue the Lord who has stepped away to pray. Their united, purposeful movement models eager obedience, communal faith, and an earnest desire to stay close to Christ. The verse reminds believers today that when Jesus seems distant, the right response is immediate, collective, wholehearted pursuit&#8212;trusting that He will always redirect our seeking toward His greater mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Simon and they that were with him.</span>--This part of the narrative is given by St. Luke also, but not by St. Matthew. The definite statement who they were that followed after Him is, however, peculiar to St. Mark; while St. Luke alone gives their motive: "they stayed Him that He should not depart from them." They would fain have kept Him at Capernaum, that He might teach them and heal their sick.
