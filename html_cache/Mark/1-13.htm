This mirrors the forty years the Israelites spent in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and the forty days Moses spent on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). Jesus' forty days in the wilderness serve as a preparation for His public ministry, emphasizing His role as the new Israel and the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>being tempted by Satan</b><br>The temptation by Satan highlights the spiritual battle between good and evil. Satan, the adversary, seeks to derail Jesus' mission from the outset. This temptation echoes the temptation of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3), but unlike Adam, Jesus resists, demonstrating His sinless nature and His role as the second Adam (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-19</a>). This event underscores Jesus' authority over Satan and His commitment to His divine mission.<p><b>He was with the wild animals</b><br>The mention of wild animals may indicate the desolate and dangerous nature of the wilderness, emphasizing Jesus' vulnerability and isolation. It also reflects the peace of the Messianic kingdom, where harmony is restored between humans and creation (<a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>). This detail underscores Jesus' dominion over creation and His role as the restorer of peace.<p><b>and the angels ministered to Him</b><br>The presence of angels ministering to Jesus signifies divine support and approval. Angels often appear in Scripture to provide guidance, protection, and strength (<a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11-12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Their ministry to Jesus highlights His divine sonship and the heavenly endorsement of His mission.

His victory secures ours and invites us to rest in His finished triumph.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And he was there in the wilderness.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2-11</a>. St. Mark compresses the history by omitting the several forms of the Temptation. Peculiar to him are (1) the use of "Satan" instead of "the devil;" (2) the statement that Jesus was "with the wild beasts." In our Lord's time these might include the panther, the bear, the wolf, the hyena, possibly the lion. The implied thought is partly that their presence added to the terrors of the Temptation, partly that in His being protected from them there was the fulfilment of the promise in the very Psalm which furnished the Tempter with his chief weapon, that the true child of God should trample under foot "the lion and the adder," the "young lion and the dragon" (<a href="/psalms/91-13.htm" title="You shall tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.">Psalm 91:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forty days tempted of Satan</span>. St. Mark gathers up the whole temptation into this one sentence; and the passage would seem to imply that the three temptations recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke were not the only trials through which our Lord passed during those forty days, although they were no doubt the prominent and the most powerful assaults upon our Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">And he was with the wild beasts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). This shows the extreme solitude of the place. It shows also the innocence of our Lord, that there, in that wild and desolate district, amongst lions, and wolves, and leopards, and serpents, he neither feared them nor was injured by them. He dwelt amongst them as Adam lived with them in his state of innocence in Paradise. These wild beasts recognized and revered their Creater and their Lord<span class="cmt_word">. And the angels ministered unto him</span>. This, as we learn from St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>), was after his temptation and victory. Some have thought that Jesus became known to the devil as the Son of God, by the reverence and adoration of the angels. Thus Jesus showed in his own person, when alone he had striven with Satan and, had overcome him, that heavenly comfort and the ministry of angels are provided by God for those who overcome temptation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
