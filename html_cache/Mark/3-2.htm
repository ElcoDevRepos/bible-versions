Their intent was not to seek truth but to find fault. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities. The Pharisees were concerned about maintaining their power and influence, which they felt threatened by Jesus' teachings and actions. This phrase highlights the adversarial relationship and the lengths to which the Pharisees would go to undermine Jesus.<p><b>they were watching</b><br>The Pharisees were closely observing Jesus, indicating their vigilance and determination to catch Him in what they perceived as wrongdoing. This scrutiny was not out of genuine interest in His teachings or miracles but rather a calculated effort to find grounds for accusation. This behavior is reminiscent of the adversarial tactics used by those who opposed the prophets in the Old Testament, such as Daniel, who was also watched closely by his enemies (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>to see if He would heal on the Sabbath</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest, as commanded in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). However, by the time of Jesus, the Pharisees had added numerous additional rules and interpretations, making the observance of the Sabbath burdensome. Healing on the Sabbath was considered work by the Pharisees, and thus, they viewed it as a violation of the law. Jesus, however, emphasized the spirit of the law over the letter, teaching that doing good and showing mercy were in keeping with God's intentions for the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>). This incident foreshadows the greater conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders over the interpretation and application of the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, known for His teachings, miracles, and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

Motive divides worship from spying.<p>- Ironically, every time these leaders watched, Jesus revealed more of His divine authority, turning their scrutiny into a witness against them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To see if He would heal</b><p>- Even His opponents acknowledged His power; they never doubted His ability, only His timing. That concession alone testifies to His deity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10</a>, the parallel account, records the leaders asking, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221; so they might accuse Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/6-10.htm">Luke 6:10</a> shows Jesus responding by restoring a withered hand, proving that mercy is always fitting.<p>- Compassion is at the heart of every miracle. <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a> summarizes His ministry: &#8220;He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.&#8221; Their cold legalism stood in stark contrast to His warm mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the Sabbath</b><p>- Sabbath rest was God&#8217;s gift (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), meant to refresh, not restrict compassion.<p>- Jesus had already declared, &#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>). Hence, He alone rightly interprets what is lawful that day.<p>- <a href="/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a> points out the leaders&#8217; inconsistency: they performed circumcision on the Sabbath yet objected to healing.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13-14</a> elevates Sabbath delight; nothing delights God more than acts of mercy that mirror His character. Healing on the Sabbath is therefore perfectly aligned with God&#8217;s intent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a> reveals hostile hearts hiding behind religious vigilance. Determined to accuse, the leaders watched Jesus, certain He could heal yet hoping He would do so at a &#8220;wrong&#8221; time. Their rigid legalism collided with the Lord of the Sabbath, who showed that mercy never violates God&#8217;s law. The verse challenges us to examine our motives: are we looking at Jesus to find fault or to embrace His life-giving compassion?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The scribes had already the evidence that our Lord had permitted his disciples to rub the ears of corn on the sabbath day. But this was the act of the disciple, not his. What he was now preparing to do was an act of miraculous power. And here the ease was stronger, because work, which was prohibited under pain of death by the Law (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>), was understood to include every act not absolutely necessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In order to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
