The term "generation" often refers to the people living at that time, and it echoes the language used in the Old Testament to describe the Israelites' frequent unbelief and rebellion (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5, 20</a>). This statement highlights the persistent issue of faithlessness that Jesus encountered during His ministry.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>The context here is a response to the disciples' inability to cast out a demon from a boy. Jesus' reply is not just to the disciples but to the crowd and the religious leaders present. It underscores His role as a teacher and a prophet, addressing the spiritual condition of those around Him.<p><b>How long must I remain with you?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes Jesus' awareness of His limited time on earth. It reflects His mission's urgency and the need for His followers to grow in faith and understanding. It also hints at His impending departure, which He had begun to reveal to His disciples (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p><b>How long must I put up with you?</b><br>This phrase conveys Jesus' patience and long-suffering nature, akin to God's patience with Israel throughout the Old Testament. It also serves as a call to spiritual maturity and reliance on God's power rather than human ability.<p><b>Bring the boy to Me.</b><br>This command demonstrates Jesus' authority and compassion. It signifies His willingness to engage directly with human suffering and His power to heal and deliver. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance He would provide through His death and resurrection. This act of bringing the boy to Jesus is a physical representation of faith and trust in His ability to heal and restore.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, expressing frustration over the lack of faith among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present during this event, they had attempted to cast out a demon but failed, prompting Jesus' response.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boy.htm">The Boy</a></b><br>A young boy possessed by a spirit, whose condition is the focus of the account.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>The boy's father, who brings his son to Jesus after the disciples' inability to heal him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of onlookers witnessing the interaction between Jesus, the disciples, and the boy's father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith.htm">The Importance of Faith</a></b><br>Jesus' exclamation underscores the necessity of faith in the believer's life.
