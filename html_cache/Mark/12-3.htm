In the parable, the servant represents the prophets sent by God to call His people to repentance. Historically, prophets like Jeremiah and Elijah faced hostility and persecution (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). The act of seizing indicates a forceful and deliberate rejection, symbolizing Israel's consistent resistance to divine messages.<p><b>beat him</b><br>The beating of the servant signifies the physical and spiritual violence inflicted upon God's messengers. This reflects the harsh treatment and suffering endured by many prophets, such as Isaiah, who according to tradition, was sawn in two (<a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). It underscores the severity of Israel's rebellion and the cost of delivering God's truth.<p><b>and sent him away empty-handed</b><br>Sending the servant away empty-handed illustrates the complete rejection of the message he carried. The servant's failure to collect the fruit symbolizes Israel's failure to produce the fruits of righteousness expected by God (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). This action foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, the Son, who was also sent by the Father and rejected by the religious leaders of His time. The empty-handed return emphasizes the unfulfilled purpose of the servant's mission, highlighting the people's refusal to acknowledge God's authority and their accountability for their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals in the parable who are responsible for caring for the vineyard.

The servant stands for God&#8217;s prophets; the tenants stand for Israel&#8217;s leaders.<p>- &#8220;Seized&#8221; shows deliberate hostility, echoing how wicked men laid hands on Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23-24</a>) and foreshadowing how they will seize Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-46.htm">Mark 14:46</a>).<p>- This first act signals open rebellion against rightful authority; their hearts are already set against giving the owner what He deserves (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).<p>- Cross-light: <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a> reminds us, &#8220;Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?&#8221;&#8212;a pattern of grabbing God&#8217;s messengers instead of heeding them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beat him</b><p>- Violence follows restraint.

The tenants&#8217; treatment of the servant exposes conscious rebellion, previews Christ&#8217;s own suffering, and warns that withholding fruit from God leaves one empty-handed when He comes to settle accounts.
