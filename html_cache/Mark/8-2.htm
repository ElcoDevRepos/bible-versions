This reflects Jesus' consistent character throughout the Gospels, where He often responds to human need with compassion (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36, 14</a>:14). This compassion is not just emotional but leads to action, demonstrating the love and care of God for His people. It also fulfills the prophetic expectation of a Messiah who would shepherd His people with care (<a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>).<p><b>because they have already been with Me three days</b><br>The mention of "three days" is significant, as it indicates the dedication and spiritual hunger of the crowd. In biblical numerology, the number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection, seen in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). This period also suggests a testing of faith and endurance, reminiscent of Israel's wilderness journey, where God provided for their needs (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>).<p><b>and have nothing to eat</b><br>This phrase highlights the physical needs of the crowd, emphasizing the human condition of dependency and the necessity of divine provision. It mirrors the Israelites' experience in the wilderness, where God provided manna (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Jesus, as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), foreshadows His role in providing spiritual sustenance. This situation sets the stage for the miracle of feeding the multitude, demonstrating Jesus' power over creation and His ability to meet both physical and spiritual needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His compassion and divine provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people who have been following Jesus for three days, eager to hear His teachings despite their physical needs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of this event, highlighting the isolation and lack of resources available to the crowd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_of_christ.htm">Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' compassion is not just an emotional response but leads to action.
