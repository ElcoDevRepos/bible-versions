Typically, victims of crucifixion could linger for days before succumbing. This rapid death fulfills Jesus' own prophecy about His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>). It also underscores the severity of the physical and spiritual agony Jesus endured, which was intensified by the prior scourging and the weight of humanity's sin. Pilate's reaction reflects a Roman governor's expectation based on experience with crucifixion, a common method of execution in the Roman Empire, designed to be a prolonged and public spectacle.<p><b>so he summoned the centurion</b><br>The centurion, a Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers, played a crucial role in the execution process. His presence and testimony were necessary to confirm the death of Jesus officially. This centurion is likely the same one who, upon witnessing Jesus' death, declared, "Truly this man was the Son of God" (<a href="/mark/15-39.htm">Mark 15:39</a>), indicating a recognition of Jesus' divine nature. The summoning of the centurion also emphasizes the legal and procedural aspects of Roman governance, ensuring that the death was verified by a reliable witness.<p><b>to ask if this was so</b><br>Pilate's inquiry to the centurion serves as a legal confirmation of Jesus' death, which was essential for the release of His body to Joseph of Arimathea. This verification process underscores the historical reality of Jesus' death, countering any claims that He merely swooned or was unconscious. The centurion's confirmation is a critical piece of evidence in the Gospel narrative, affirming the truth of Jesus' death and, subsequently, the miracle of His resurrection. This moment also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's death, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of His grave being with the wicked and the rich, pointing to His burial in a rich man's tomb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

The day being the Preparation, the Jews were anxious to satisfy the letter of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>), and that, more especially, because the coming sabbath was a "high day."

This violence was not inflicted upon our Lord, because he was already dead; and so another Scripture was fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken." But it was necessary that Pilate should be assured of the fact that death had taken place before he gave up the body; and thus, in the providence of God, another evidence was given of the reality of Christ's death. Joseph asked for the body (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). Then Pilate asked the centurion "whether he had been any while dead." The verb here is in the aorist, and the adverb means "formerly" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">if he died some time ago.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
