In the Jewish context, the market was a place where one could come into contact with Gentiles or ritually unclean items, necessitating purification before eating. This practice is rooted in the Levitical laws concerning cleanliness (Leviticus 11-15), though the specific ritual washing described here is part of the oral traditions that developed around the written law. These traditions were intended to maintain holiness and separation from anything considered impure. The emphasis on washing underscores the Pharisees' focus on external rituals as a means of maintaining spiritual purity, which Jesus often critiqued for neglecting the heart's condition (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>).<p><b>And there are many other traditions for them to observe,</b><br>The phrase indicates the extensive nature of the oral traditions that had developed by the time of Jesus. These traditions, known as the "Oral Torah," were later codified in the Mishnah. They were meant to act as a "fence" around the Torah, ensuring that the written laws were not inadvertently broken. This reflects a broader cultural and religious effort to live in strict adherence to God's commandments, though it often led to legalism and a focus on human traditions over divine commandments (<a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>).<p><b>including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles,</b><br>The washing of these items reflects the detailed nature of the purity laws. Each item used in food preparation and consumption was subject to ritual cleansing to prevent defilement. This practice is reminiscent of the purification rituals prescribed for the Tabernacle and Temple service (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>). The focus on such minutiae illustrates the Pharisees' dedication to ritual purity but also sets the stage for Jesus' teaching that true defilement comes from within, not from external sources (<a href="/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>).<p><b>and couches for dining.</b><br>The mention of couches, or dining couches, highlights the extent to which ritual purity was applied. In the Greco-Roman world, dining often took place on reclining couches, and the inclusion of these in purification rituals shows the integration of Jewish customs with broader cultural practices. This reflects the historical context of Hellenistic influence on Jewish life during the Second Temple period. The emphasis on cleansing even the furniture used for dining underscores the comprehensive nature of the purity laws and traditions, which Jesus challenges by emphasizing inner purity over external ritual (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jewish society who were known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

They feared that contact with Gentiles or fellow Jews who were ceremonially unclean would defile them (cf. <a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The washing described is not ordinary hand-cleaning for hygiene but a ritual act meant to remove spiritual contamination (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a> reminds us that priests washed before service, and the Pharisees extended that priestly requirement to everyday life).<p>&#8226; By bringing up the market, Jesus exposes how far tradition had gone&#8212;turning everyday commerce into a potential threat to holiness (see <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20-23</a>, where man-made regulations are contrasted with true godliness).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And there are many other traditions for them to observe,</b><p>The verse widens the lens to show that hand-washing was only one example in a long list of man-made rules.<p>&#8226; Over time, oral traditions had accumulated alongside Scripture (<a href="/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3, 6</a>).<p>&#8226; These customs created a fence around the Law, but they often obscured God&#8217;s original intent (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; larger point in the chapter is that elevating human tradition can nullify the word of God (<a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining.</b><p>Here Jesus names specific household items to show how meticulous&#8212;and burdensome&#8212;the regulations had become.<p>&#8226; Ritual purity extended from people to objects (<a href="/leviticus/11-32.htm">Leviticus 11:32-35</a> speaks of vessels becoming unclean), yet the Pharisees expanded the list to include dining couches, which Scripture never commanded.<p>&#8226; The emphasis on external cleansing contrasted sharply with Jesus&#8217; call for inner purity (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226;

The Pharisees&#8217; elaborate washings sought to guard holiness but ended up focusing on outward ritual rather than inward righteousness. Jesus exposes this imbalance to redirect His followers toward genuine purity&#8212;a clean heart made possible by faith and obedience to God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Except they wash.</span>--The Greek verb differs from that in the previous verse, and implies the washing or immersion (the verb is that from which our word "baptise" comes to us) of the whole body, as the former does of part.

They might have come, in the crowd of the market, into passing contact with a Gentile, and his touch was as defiling as if it had been that of a corpse.

The word is, perhaps, used in the same sense in <a href="/mark/4-21.htm" title="And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?">Mark 4:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they come from the market</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">and from the market-place</span>; there is no verb in the principal manuscripts, although the Cambridge Codex has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the old Latin gives <span class="accented">redeuntes.</span> In the market-place there would be every kind of men and things, clean and unclean, by contact with which they feared that they might be polluted; and so they considered that they had need to cleanse themselves from this impurity by a more careful and complete ablution. Another Greek word is used here, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In the former verse the word is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, a more partial and superficial kind of washing than that implied in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>. It should, however, be added that two of the great uncials, Vatican and Sinaitic, have <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "sprinkle themselves," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x28;</span> an authority sufficient to justify the Revisers of 1881 in putting it into the margin. <span class="cmt_word">The washing of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels, and of tables</span>. The words (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) wrongly rendered, "and of tables" - because they could only mean "couches" - have not sufficient authority to be retained in the text. "Cups" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) mean "drinking vessels." The "pot" (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>) is a Roman word, <span class="accented">sextarius</span>, a small liquid measure, the sixth part of a <span class="accented">congius</span>, corresponding nearly to the English gallon, so that <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> would be rather more than a pint measure. Brasen v<span class="accented">essels.</span> These would probably be copper vessels, such as are still used in Syria for cooking purposes. These are particularly mentioned. Earthenware vessels would be broken. <span class="cmt_word">Which they have received to hold</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">which they received to hold</span>: observe the aorist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[on returning] from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
