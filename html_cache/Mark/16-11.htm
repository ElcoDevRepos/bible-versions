The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The disbelief of the disciples highlights the unexpected nature of the resurrection, despite Jesus' prior predictions (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:34). This moment underscores the human tendency to doubt extraordinary claims, even when foretold by a trusted source.<p><b>and she had seen Him</b><br>The "she" in this context is Mary Magdalene, who is mentioned earlier in the chapter as the first to witness the risen Christ. Her role is significant, as women were not considered reliable witnesses in first-century Jewish culture. This detail emphasizes the authenticity of the Gospel accounts, as such a testimony would not be fabricated if the story were invented. Mary's encounter with Jesus is a personal and transformative experience, reflecting the intimate nature of Christ's post-resurrection appearances (<a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>).<p><b>they did not believe it</b><br>The disciples' disbelief is a recurring theme in the resurrection narratives (<a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>, <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>). This skepticism serves to strengthen the credibility of the resurrection accounts, as it shows that even Jesus' closest followers were not predisposed to believe without evidence. Their eventual belief, following personal encounters with the risen Christ, underscores the transformative power of witnessing the resurrection firsthand. This disbelief also highlights the necessity of faith, a key component of Christian doctrine, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, whose resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus who was the first to witness the resurrected Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' closest followers who initially doubted the resurrection report.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, fulfilling His prophecy and demonstrating His divine nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_faith.htm">The Challenge of Faith</a></b><br>Faith often requires believing in what we have not seen.
