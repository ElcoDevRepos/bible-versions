This approach was often used to provoke thought and reflection. It also serves to challenge the authority and intentions of the religious leaders questioning Him. This method is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus uses questions to reveal deeper truths and expose the hearts of His listeners.<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>The context here is Jesus' interaction with the chief priests, scribes, and elders in the temple courts. They had questioned His authority after He cleansed the temple and performed miracles. Jesus' response is not just a simple answer but a strategic reply that highlights His wisdom and understanding of the law and the prophets. His reply also demonstrates His authority and divine insight, which often left His opponents unable to respond.<p><b>&#8220;and if you answer Me,</b><br>Jesus sets a condition for revealing the source of His authority. This conditional statement places the religious leaders in a position where they must confront their own beliefs and biases. It also reflects the biblical principle that understanding and revelation often require a response of faith and honesty. This mirrors the way God often interacts with humanity, requiring a response to His initiatives.<p><b>I will tell you by what authority</b><br>The question of authority is central to this passage. In the Jewish context, authority was derived from adherence to the Law and the traditions of the elders. Jesus' authority, however, comes directly from God, as seen in His teachings, miracles, and fulfillment of prophecy. This authority is a key theme in the Gospels, where Jesus is repeatedly shown to have authority over nature, illness, sin, and even death.<p><b>I am doing these things.</b><br>"These things" refer to Jesus' actions in the temple, including the cleansing of the temple and His teaching. These acts were seen as a direct challenge to the religious establishment and their practices. Jesus' actions fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's role in purifying worship and establishing true righteousness. His deeds are a testament to His identity as the Son of God and the promised Messiah, who has come to establish God's kingdom on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the religious leaders who question His authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests,_scribes,_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests, Scribes, and Elders</a></b><br>These are the religious leaders who challenge Jesus' authority in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, a significant place of worship and teaching for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is relevant to the context as Jesus refers to John's baptism in the surrounding verses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present in the temple who witness this exchange between Jesus and the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' authority is divine and not derived from human institutions.

By framing it as &#8220;one question,&#8221; He strips away the religious leaders&#8217; evasions and forces them to face truth (cf. <a href="/mark/12-37.htm">Mark 12:37</a>; <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus often used a single question to reveal hearts&#8212;see <a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25&#8211;37</a>, where one question brings out the parable of the Good Samaritan.<p>&#8226; Here, the question will expose whether the chief priests and scribes will acknowledge divine authority or cling to self-preservation (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds us that God&#8217;s Word pierces to &#8220;judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus replied</b><p>&#8226; The leaders had demanded, &#8220;By what authority are You doing these things?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/11-28.htm">Mark 11:28</a>). Jesus&#8217; reply shows He is not intimidated; He speaks as the ultimate Authority (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His calm response reflects <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>: &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath,&#8221; yet His words carry the weight of divine judgment (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that Christ&#8212;God in flesh&#8212;personally answers human challenges.

Their refusal to answer shows they reject God&#8217;s authority, not merely Jesus&#8217; (<a href="/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/11-29.htm">Mark 11:29</a> reveals a Savior who lovingly but firmly confronts unbelief.
