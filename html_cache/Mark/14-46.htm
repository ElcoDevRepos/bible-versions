The "men" refers to the group sent by the chief priests, scribes, and elders, likely including Roman soldiers and temple guards (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>). This act of seizing Jesus is significant as it demonstrates the transition from His public ministry to His passion. The arrest occurs in the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of prayer and solitude for Jesus, highlighting the contrast between His peaceful intentions and the violent actions of His captors. This moment fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being betrayed and handed over to His enemies (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<p><b>and arrested Him.</b><br>The arrest of Jesus is a pivotal event in the Passion narrative, leading directly to His trials and crucifixion. The term "arrested" indicates the legal and formal nature of the action, as the religious leaders sought to eliminate Jesus through the Roman legal system. This event is a fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:33-34). The arrest also reflects the cultural and historical tensions of the time, as the Jewish leaders felt threatened by Jesus' growing influence and sought to maintain their authority. This moment is a key part of the divine plan for redemption, as Jesus willingly submits to arrest, knowing it will lead to His sacrificial death for the sins of humanity (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being arrested in this passage.
