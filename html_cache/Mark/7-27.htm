Jesus is emphasizing the priority of His mission to the Jews, as they were the initial recipients of God's covenant promises (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The term "have their fill" suggests the abundance of spiritual nourishment and blessings intended for Israel. This reflects the historical context where Jesus' earthly ministry was primarily focused on the Jewish people, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah coming to Israel (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p><b>He said.</b><br>This indicates Jesus' direct speech, highlighting His authoritative teaching. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses parables and metaphors to convey deeper spiritual truths. His words here are part of a larger dialogue with a Syrophoenician woman, demonstrating His willingness to engage with Gentiles, even as He underscores the initial focus on Israel.<p><b>For it is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread</b><br>The "children&#8217;s bread" symbolizes the blessings and teachings meant for the Israelites. Bread is a common biblical metaphor for sustenance and life, as seen in Jesus' declaration of being the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). This phrase underscores the appropriateness of prioritizing the Jewish people in receiving the message of the Kingdom, aligning with God's redemptive plan that began with Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and toss it to the dogs.</b><br>The term "dogs" was a common Jewish metaphor for Gentiles, reflecting the cultural and religious divide of the time. While it may seem harsh, Jesus uses this metaphor to test the faith of the Syrophoenician woman and to illustrate the prevailing Jewish view of Gentiles. However, this encounter foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's salvation plan, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the early church's outreach to non-Jews (Acts 10). Jesus' interaction with the woman ultimately reveals His compassion and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, fulfilling the prophecy of a Messiah for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing a Gentile woman who has come to Him seeking healing for her daughter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_syrophoenician_woman.htm">The Syrophoenician Woman</a></b><br>A Gentile woman from the region of Tyre and Sidon, she approaches Jesus with faith, seeking deliverance for her demon-possessed daughter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present with Jesus, they often serve as witnesses to His teachings and miracles, learning from His interactions with others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre_and_sidon.htm">Tyre and Sidon</a></b><br>Regions known for their Gentile populations, highlighting the cultural and religious differences between Jews and Gentiles at the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter.htm">The Daughter</a></b><br>The afflicted child of the Syrophoenician woman, whose healing is the focus of the mother's plea to Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' initial focus was on the Jews, fulfilling God's covenant promises.

This does not mean others are excluded; it affirms the priority of the covenant people so that the Messiah&#8217;s identity and mission remain unmistakable.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Have their fill&#8221; shows the sufficiency of God&#8217;s provision. Christ came to feed Israel with the truth of the gospel, like manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-12.htm">Exodus 16:12-15</a>) and ultimately the &#8220;bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The Syrophoenician woman&#8217;s presence highlights the wideness of God&#8217;s mercy. Her very request anticipates the time when Gentiles too will &#8220;eat and be satisfied&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For it is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread and toss it to the dogs</b><p>&#8220;For it is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread and toss it to the dogs.&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-27.htm">Mark 7:27</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Not right&#8221; underscores divine order, not divine reluctance.

Here it suggests outsider status, yet the diminutive nuance in the parallel passage (<a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26-27</a>) softens the term; household pets wait under the table. The woman&#8217;s humble response (&#8220;even the dogs under the table eat the children&#8217;s crumbs&#8221;) reveals faith that bridges the covenant gap (<a href="/mark/7-28.htm">Mark 7:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus grants her request, demonstrating that grace overflows Israel&#8217;s table to bless the nations, fulfilling <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> and foreshadowing <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>,19&#8212;Gentiles brought near and made &#8220;members of God&#8217;s household.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/7-27.htm">Mark 7:27</a> teaches that God&#8217;s redemptive program honors His promises to Israel first, yet His mercy is never limited to one ethnicity.
