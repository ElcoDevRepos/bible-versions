The context is Jesus' ministry in the Decapolis, a region with a significant Gentile population. This encounter follows Jesus' calming of the storm, demonstrating His authority over nature and the spiritual realm.<p><b>they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons</b><br>The man was previously tormented by a "legion" of demons, indicating a large number, as a Roman legion consisted of about 6,000 soldiers. This highlights the severity of his possession and the power of Jesus to overcome such a formidable force. The man's condition before meeting Jesus is described earlier in the chapter, emphasizing his isolation and torment.<p><b>sitting there</b><br>The act of sitting signifies peace and rest, a stark contrast to the man's previous state of unrest and violence. In biblical times, sitting was often associated with learning or being in a state of calm, suggesting the man was now receptive and at peace.<p><b>clothed</b><br>Previously, the man was naked, a sign of his shame and the control the demons had over him. Being clothed symbolizes restoration and dignity. In biblical terms, clothing often represents righteousness and being in a right relationship with God, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>).<p><b>and in his right mind</b><br>This indicates a complete transformation, as the man was once out of control and self-destructive. Being in his right mind suggests mental and spiritual healing, reflecting the comprehensive nature of Jesus' healing power. It also signifies the restoration of the man's identity and humanity.<p><b>and they were afraid</b><br>The reaction of fear from the people can be understood in several ways. It may reflect awe at the power of Jesus, fear of the unknown, or concern over the economic loss of the pigs that drowned. This fear is a common response to divine encounters in Scripture, as seen in the reactions to angelic appearances or miraculous events. It underscores the profound impact of Jesus' authority and the challenge it posed to the status quo.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches with authority.

Everyone heads straight for Jesus&#8212;He is the focal point of every true spiritual encounter. Luke&#8217;s parallel account confirms the scene: &#8220;When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-35.htm">Luke 8:35</a>). As with the frightened disciples in the storm who also &#8220;came to Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38-41</a>), the right response to chaos is always to approach the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they saw the man</b><p>A moment earlier this man had been the terror of the region; now he is the picture of peace.

Similar awe gripped the disciples after Jesus stilled the storm: &#8220;They were terrified and asked, &#8216;Who is this?

Holiness can be unsettling; <a href="/acts/5-5.htm">Acts 5:5</a> notes that fear seized all who saw divine power displayed.

St, Luke adds that they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus. It is likely enough that the man, as soon as he found himself dispossessed, had east himself at the feet of Jesus, and was worshipping him; but that, when hidden by Christ to sit, he chose to place himself at his feet. "He was clothed, and in his right mind." What a contrast to the previous description! "And they were afraid." They dreaded Christ's power. They saw that he was almighty; but they did not seek to know his love, and so to attain to that love which "casteth out fear." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchontai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
