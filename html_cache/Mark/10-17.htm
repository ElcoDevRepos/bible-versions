It reflects the itinerant nature of His ministry, where He traveled to various towns and villages to preach and teach. This movement is significant as it often sets the stage for important encounters and teachings. Jesus' journey here is part of His final trip to Jerusalem, where He will ultimately face crucifixion, fulfilling His mission as the Messiah.<p><b>a man ran up and knelt before Him</b><br>The act of running and kneeling shows urgency and respect. In the cultural context of the time, kneeling was a sign of reverence and submission, often reserved for someone of high status or authority. This man's actions suggest he recognizes Jesus as someone with spiritual authority. The man's approach contrasts with the typical reserved demeanor expected in public interactions, indicating his desperation or earnestness in seeking an answer.<p><b>&#8220;Good Teacher,&#8221; he asked</b><br>Addressing Jesus as "Good Teacher" reflects a recognition of His moral and spiritual authority. In Jewish culture, the term "good" was not commonly used lightly, especially in reference to teachers, as ultimate goodness was attributed to God alone. This salutation sets the stage for Jesus' response, which will challenge the man's understanding of goodness and its source.<p><b>&#8220;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&#8221;</b><br>The question reveals the man's concern with eternal matters and his desire for assurance of salvation. It reflects a common Jewish belief in the afterlife and the importance of living a life that aligns with God's commandments to secure one's place in it. The phrasing "inherit eternal life" suggests a view of salvation as a possession or reward, which Jesus will address by redirecting the focus from human actions to divine grace. This question is central to the Gospel message, as it opens a discussion on the nature of salvation, faith, and the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, known as the "Good Teacher."

That ongoing motion underlines that redemption is an unfolding plan, not an abstract idea. Like <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>, the Messiah sets His face like flint toward His mission, and nothing deters Him.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan advances even in the ordinary moments of travel (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Followers are called to keep in step with Him (<a href="/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A man ran up and knelt before Him</b><p>The man&#8217;s urgency is obvious&#8212;he runs. His reverence is equally clear&#8212;he kneels. Both actions reveal that he senses Jesus&#8217; authority (<a href="/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a>) yet still thinks from a human achievement mindset.<p>&#8226; Running shows spiritual hunger (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Kneeling signals homage (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>), but genuine surrender must go beyond outward posture (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Good Teacher,&#8221;</b><p>The man calls Jesus &#8220;good,&#8221; a title reserved for God alone (<a href="/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a>).

The man senses the value of life that never ends but misunderstands the pathway.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a> defines eternal life as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11-12</a> affirms, &#8220;He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17</a> introduces a sincere seeker who runs to Jesus, kneels, and asks the right question with the wrong assumption&#8212;that eternal life hinges on human doing. The verse sets the stage for Jesus to redirect him from works to grace, from admiration of a &#8220;Good Teacher&#8221; to faith in the only One who is truly good. In this brief encounter we learn: God&#8217;s redemptive plan moves forward, genuine reverence must match inner faith, absolute goodness belongs to God alone, works cannot earn salvation, and eternal life is a relational inheritance received by believing in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17-27) <span class= "bld">And when he was gone forth.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as He was going forth.</span> (See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?">Matthew 19:16-26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Running, and kneeled to him.</span>--Another of St. Mark's vividly descriptive touches. The adjective "good," which is wanting in the better MSS. of St. Matthew, is the true reading here. St. Mark and St. Luke give the word "inherit," instead of St. Matthew's "have," or "possess."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This verse should be rendered, <span class="cmt_word">And as he was going forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) - that is, just as he was leaving the house <span class="cmt_word">- there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-20.htm">Matthew 21:20</a>) says that he was "a young man." St. Luke (<a href="/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18</a>) that he was "a ruler." He had apparently been waiting for our Lord, waylaying him, though with a good intention. He showed zeal - as soon as he saw Jesus he ran to him; and he showed reverence, for he kneeled down to him. He wanted advice from one whom he must have heard of as a celebrated Teacher; and he wanted this counsel as a matter of great interest to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Good Master</span>. This would be the ordinary and courteous mode of accosting a person professing to be a teacher, so as to conciliate his attention and interest. <span class="cmt_word">What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> It is as though he said, "Rabbi, I know thee to be good, both as a man and as a teacher, and a prophet, well able to teach me perfectly those things which are really good, and which lead to blessedness hereafter. Tell me, therefore, What shall I do?" St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) says, "What good thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] started</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(ekporeuomenou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1607.htm">Strong's 1607: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ek and poreuomai; to depart, be discharged, proceed, project.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
