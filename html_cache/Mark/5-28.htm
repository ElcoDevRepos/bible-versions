In the cultural context of the time, women often had limited access to public spaces and religious leaders, making her repeated assertion even more significant. Her internal dialogue reflects a deep conviction and hope, despite her prolonged suffering. This persistence is reminiscent of the faith seen in other biblical figures, such as the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, who continually sought justice.<p><b>If only I touch His garments</b><br>Touching the garments of a rabbi or holy man was believed to convey a blessing or healing, rooted in the cultural and religious practices of the time. The hem of a garment, or the tassels (tzitzit), held particular significance in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>, where they serve as a reminder of God's commandments. This act of reaching for Jesus' garment symbolizes her faith in His divine power and authority. The act of touching is also significant in the context of ritual purity laws, as her condition would have rendered her ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>), yet she believed in the transformative power of Jesus.<p><b>I will be healed</b><br>The woman's statement is a declaration of faith, expressing her belief in Jesus' ability to heal her. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels, where faith is often a prerequisite for healing (<a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>, <a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>). Her confidence in Jesus' power to heal is a testament to His reputation as a miracle worker and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speak of the Messiah bearing our infirmities. Her faith is rewarded, as seen in the subsequent verses, where Jesus acknowledges her faith and grants her healing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A woman suffering from a bleeding condition for twelve years, considered ceremonially unclean according to Jewish law, which isolated her from society and religious practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, whose power and compassion are highlighted in this passage.
