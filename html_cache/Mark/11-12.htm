It sets the stage for the events that unfold in the following verses, emphasizing the progression of Jesus' final week leading up to His crucifixion. The timing is significant as it aligns with the Passover week, a period filled with symbolic meaning and prophetic fulfillment.<p><b>when they had left Bethany</b><br>Bethany was a small village located about two miles east of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. It was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. This location served as a place of rest and refuge for Jesus during His visits to Jerusalem. The mention of Bethany highlights the close relationships Jesus had with His followers and the strategic location from which He would enter Jerusalem.<p><b>Jesus was hungry</b><br>This phrase underscores the humanity of Jesus, showing that He experienced physical needs like hunger. It also sets the stage for the subsequent event involving the fig tree, which serves as a symbolic act and a teaching moment. The hunger of Jesus can be seen as a metaphor for His desire for spiritual fruitfulness among His people, a theme that is explored further in the following verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, demonstrating His humanity through hunger.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Accompanying Jesus, they are witnesses to His actions and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem, serving as a base for Jesus during His final week before the crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fig_tree.htm">The Fig Tree (implied in the following verses)</a></b><br>Though not mentioned in this specific verse, it becomes significant in the subsequent verses as an object lesson.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_humanity.htm">Jesus' Humanity</a></b><br>Jesus experienced physical needs like hunger, reminding us of His full humanity.
