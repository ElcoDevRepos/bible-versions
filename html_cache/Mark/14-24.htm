This intimate setting underscores the importance of His words. The Last Supper is a pivotal moment in the Gospels, occurring just before Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. It is a time of deep fellowship and teaching, where Jesus prepares His disciples for the events to come.<p><b>This is My blood of the covenant</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to His blood as the blood of the covenant, drawing a parallel to the Old Testament covenants, particularly the Mosaic covenant, which was ratified with the blood of sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>). This signifies a new covenant, prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new relationship with His people. Jesus' blood symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling and surpassing the old covenant's requirements.<p><b>which is poured out for many</b><br>The phrase "poured out" evokes the imagery of sacrificial offerings in the temple, where blood was poured out as atonement for sin. Jesus' sacrifice is for "many," indicating the vast reach of His atonement, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant bearing the sins of many.
