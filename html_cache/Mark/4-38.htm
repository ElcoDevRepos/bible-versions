Jesus being in the stern symbolizes His authority and control over the situation, even when it appears He is inactive. This setting on the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in Israel, is significant as it was a central location for Jesus' ministry. The Sea of Galilee is known for sudden storms due to its geographical setting, which adds to the drama of the narrative.<p><b>sleeping on the cushion</b><br>Jesus sleeping during a storm highlights His humanity and physical exhaustion from ministry. It also demonstrates His divine peace and trust in God's sovereignty, contrasting with the disciples' fear. The cushion, likely a leather or cloth pillow used by sailors, indicates a common practice of the time, providing a glimpse into the daily life and practices of first-century fishermen.<p><b>So they woke Him and said</b><br>The disciples' decision to wake Jesus shows their desperation and lack of understanding of His divine nature. It reflects a common human tendency to seek divine intervention only when circumstances become dire. This action also sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His power over nature, reinforcing His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher, don&#8217;t You care that we are perishing?&#8221;</b><br>The title "Teacher" acknowledges Jesus' role as a rabbi and leader, yet the question reveals the disciples' doubt and fear. Their plea reflects a lack of faith and understanding of Jesus' mission and power. This moment parallels other biblical instances where God's people question His care, such as the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>). It serves as a reminder of human frailty and the need for faith in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is asleep in the stern of the boat during a storm.

This detail underscores that the account is historical, not allegorical (cf. <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Being in the stern, Jesus is nearest the rudder yet doing nothing to guide it&#8212;a vivid picture of His absolute confidence in the Father&#8217;s providence (cf. <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Jonah asleep in the hold (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>), Jesus&#8217; presence in the storm reminds us that God Himself is in the vessel with His people. Unlike Jonah, however, Jesus is the sinless Savior who will calm the sea rather than cause it to rage (<a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sleeping on the cushion.</b><p>&#8226; The Creator who &#8220;sustains all things by His powerful word&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>) experiences genuine human fatigue after a full day of teaching (<a href="/mark/4-1.htm">Mark 4:1-34</a>).<p>&#8226; His sleep fulfills <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>: &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a> declares that the Lord &#8220;neither slumbers nor sleeps&#8221; in His divine nature, yet Jesus, in His humanity, does sleep. This paradox highlights both His deity and His incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The cushion (literally the helmsman&#8217;s seat) becomes a symbol of restful authority; even when He appears inactive, Jesus reigns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they woke Him and said,</b><p>&#8226; The disciples turn instinctively to the One who has authority (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>), modeling&#8212;even in panic&#8212;the wisdom of calling on the Lord in trouble (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>; <a href="/luke/8-24.htm">Luke 8:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Their action illustrates faith mixed with fear: they believe He can help, yet their anxiety clouds that belief (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment invites reflection on the privilege believers have to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>), even when faith feels frail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Teacher, don&#8217;t You care</b><p>&#8226; They address Him as &#8220;Teacher&#8221; (Didaskalos), acknowledging His role but falling short of grasping His full glory (<a href="/mark/8-29.htm">Mark 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Their cry echoes Martha&#8217;s later plea, &#8220;Lord, don&#8217;t You care&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40</a>). Human hearts easily question God&#8217;s compassion when circumstances turn dire.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly assures us of His care: &#8220;Casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>); &#8220;I have compassion on the crowd&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that we are perishing?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;perishing&#8221; points to imminent physical danger but also foreshadows humanity&#8217;s greater peril without Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35-37</a> reminds believers that no storm&#8212;literal or figurative&#8212;can separate us from His love.<p>&#8226; Jesus will shortly prove that His power extends over death itself (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>), answering their fear with resurrection authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a> affirms His desire that none should perish eternally; the calming of the sea is a foretaste of His ultimate rescue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a> captures the contrast between Jesus&#8217; perfect rest and the disciples&#8217; frantic fear. His position in the stern shows sovereign presence, His sleep reveals trust and true humanity, their awakening plea demonstrates instinctive yet imperfect faith, and their question about His care exposes the unbelief He lovingly confronts. In every storm, this verse calls believers to remember: the Lord who sleeps in perfect peace is also the Master who speaks, &#8220;Peace, be still,&#8221; and the waves obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Asleep on a pillow.</span>--Better, on <span class= "ital">the</span> pillow--the cushion commonly to be found in the boat's stern.<p><span class= "bld">Carest thou not that we perish?</span>--St. Mark alone gives this touch of despairing expostulation, in which we trace the specific want of faith which was afterwards reproved.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">he himself was in the stern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>) <span class="accented">asleep on the cushion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).
