The word here rendered "very great" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a word not to be found anywhere else in the New Testament.

This is properly marked in the Revised Version by the words, <span class="cmt_word">a great multitude,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and they had nothing to eat.</span> Our Lord has compassion on them. He desires not only to heal the sick, but to feed the hungry. We may here notice the burning zeal of the multitude. They were so intent upon hearing Christ, that they forgot to provide themselves with the necessaries of life. They continued with him for three days and had nothing to eat. Whatever small supplies they might have Brought with them at first were now exhausted; and still they remained, "esteeming his words to be more than their necessary food." Our Lord on his part was so. full of zeal for their good, that during all that time, with little interval, he had been preaching to them, denying himself rest, refreshment, and sleep. So true were those words of his, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
