The harvest represents a time of reckoning when the fruits of one's labor are gathered. In the Old Testament, harvest festivals like the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) were times of celebration and gratitude to God for His provision (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). Spiritually, harvest time can symbolize the end of the age when God will gather His people (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>).<p><b>he sent a servant</b><br>The sending of a servant reflects the role of prophets in the Old Testament, whom God sent to Israel to call them back to faithfulness. Prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah were often rejected by the people, similar to the treatment of the servants in this parable (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>). This action foreshadows the sending of Jesus, God's ultimate messenger, who was also rejected.<p><b>to the tenants</b><br>The tenants represent the religious leaders of Israel, who were entrusted with the care of God's people. In the historical context, tenant farming was common in ancient Palestine, where landowners would lease their land to farmers in exchange for a portion of the produce. The tenants' responsibility was to manage the vineyard and produce fruit, symbolizing the leaders' duty to guide the people in righteousness.<p><b>to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard</b><br>The vineyard is a metaphor for Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where God describes Israel as His vineyard. The expectation of fruit signifies God's desire for righteousness and justice from His people. The owner's share represents God's rightful claim to the fruits of His people's labor, which includes faithfulness, obedience, and worship. The failure to produce fruit is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, highlighting the spiritual barrenness of Israel's leaders (<a href="/matthew/21-43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard_owner.htm">The Vineyard Owner</a></b><br>Represents God, who has established His people and expects them to bear fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes Israel, God's chosen people, entrusted with His laws and blessings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the religious leaders of Israel who were responsible for guiding the people but failed to do so faithfully.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes the prophets sent by God to call His people to repentance and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_time.htm">Harvest Time</a></b><br>Represents the time of accountability and judgment when God expects to see the fruits of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_expectation_of_fruitfulness.htm">God's Expectation of Fruitfulness</a></b><br>God expects His people to bear spiritual fruit, reflecting His character and purposes in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>Just as the tenants were accountable to the vineyard owner, we are accountable to God for how we live and steward His gifts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_god's_messengers.htm">Rejection of God's Messengers</a></b><br>The parable warns against rejecting those whom God sends to guide and correct us, including His Word and His Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_patience_and_justice_of_god.htm">The Patience and Justice of God</a></b><br>God is patient, sending multiple servants, but His justice will ultimately prevail if there is continued unfaithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_leaders.htm">The Role of Prophets and Leaders</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders are called to be faithful stewards, guiding others in truth and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_12_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 12:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_12_2_God_s_patience_shown_how.htm">How does Mark 12:2 illustrate God's patience with His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Servant_s_symbolism_in_Mark_12_2.htm">What does the servant symbolize in Mark 12:2's parable?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Identify_react_to_God_s_messengers.htm">How can we recognize and respond to God's messengers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Mark_12_2_Isaiah_5_1-7_Similarities.htm">Compare Mark 12:2 with Isaiah 5:1-7.

St. Mark, characteristically, seizes on the most vivid presentation of the facts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-34.htm">Matthew 21:34</a>) says he sent "his servants." St. Mark mentions them in detail. These servants were the prophets, as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, whom the Jews persecuted and slew in different ways, as the reprovers of their vices. But the mercy of God was long-suffering, and still triumphed over their wickedness. In his account of this parable St. Mark is very minute. The first servant that was sent received no fruit, and was beaten. The second received much worse usage. According to the Authorized Version the words are, <span class="cmt_word">At him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).
