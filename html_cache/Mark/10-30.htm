The concept of "a hundredfold" is a hyperbolic expression used to convey the idea of overwhelming abundance. In the context of first-century Palestine, where Jesus spoke these words, such a return would have been considered extraordinary. This promise is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and relational blessings as well. The idea of receiving blessings in the "present age" suggests that followers of Christ will experience God's provision and community support even now, not just in the afterlife.<p><b>houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields,</b><br>This list represents the various aspects of life that a believer might sacrifice for the sake of following Christ. In the early church, believers often faced the loss of family ties and property due to their faith. However, the promise here is that they will gain a new family within the body of Christ, the church. The communal life of the early Christians, as described in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>, exemplifies this reality, where believers shared their possessions and supported one another. The mention of "fields" also indicates the restoration of livelihood and provision, reflecting God's care for His people.<p><b>along with persecutions&#8212;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the reality of suffering and opposition that believers will face. Persecution was a common experience for early Christians, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles and the epistles. Jesus Himself warned His followers of the cost of discipleship, including persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). This serves as a reminder that the Christian life involves both blessings and challenges. The inclusion of persecutions highlights the paradox of the Christian experience: joy and suffering coexist, and faithfulness to Christ often invites opposition from the world.<p><b>and in the age to come, eternal life.</b><br>This phrase points to the ultimate hope and reward for believers: eternal life. The "age to come" refers to the eschatological future when God's kingdom is fully realized. Eternal life is a central theme in the New Testament, promised to those who believe in Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). It signifies not only unending existence but also a quality of life characterized by perfect fellowship with God. This promise provides assurance and motivation for believers to endure present trials, knowing that their ultimate reward is secure in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this promise, offering assurance to His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus, who have left everything to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecutions.htm">Persecutions</a></b><br>The trials and challenges that believers will face as part of their faith journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/present_age.htm">Present Age</a></b><br>The current life and world in which believers live and experience God's blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The promise of everlasting life with God in the age to come.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_living.htm">Sacrificial Living</a></b><br>Believers are called to prioritize their relationship with Christ above all else, even if it means sacrificing personal comforts and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_abundance.htm">Promise of Abundance</a></b><br>God promises to provide abundantly for those who follow Him, not just in material terms but in spiritual family and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_through_persecution.htm">Endurance Through Persecution</a></b><br>Persecution is an expected part of the Christian journey, but it is accompanied by God's provision and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Keeping an eternal perspective helps believers endure present trials, knowing that eternal life is the ultimate reward.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>The church serves as a new family for believers, providing support and fellowship in this life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_10_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 10:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_30_Eternal_over_earthly.htm">How does Mark 10:30 encourage believers to prioritize eternal rewards over earthly possessions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_hundredfold_show_about_God.htm">What does "a hundredfold" in Mark 10:30 reveal about God's generosity to believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Inspire_persecuted_Christians_today.htm">How can Mark 10:30 inspire Christians facing persecution for their faith today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Bible_verses_on_rewards_for_sacrifices.htm">Which other Bible verses emphasize rewards for sacrifices made for Christ's sake?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_gain_a_hundredfold_daily.htm">How can believers practically "receive a hundredfold" in their daily Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_hundredfold_in_Mark_10_30.htm">What does Mark 10:30 mean by "a hundredfold" in this life and the age to come?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_30_Sacrifice_and_reward.htm">How does Mark 10:30 address the concept of sacrifice and reward in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_Mark_10_30_about_wealth_or_blessings.htm">Does Mark 10:30 promise material wealth or spiritual blessings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_many_blind_men_healed_near_jericho.htm">How many blind men did Jesus heal near Jericho?

(See Notes on <a href="/matthew/19-29.htm" title="And every one that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred times, and shall inherit everlasting life.">Matthew 19:29</a>.) We may, perhaps, venture to think of them as having been engraved on Peter's mind by the lessons of his experience. He had been taught to see in the "fiery trial" almost the necessary condition of the "exceeding joy" (<a href="/context/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12-13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). St. Luke (<a href="/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>) says (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) "manifold more" - an indefinite increase, to show the greatness and multitude of the recompense. He who forsakes his own for the sake of Christ will find others, many in number, who will give him the love of brethren and sisters, with even greater affection; so that he will seem not to have lost or forsaken his own, but to have received them again with interest. For spiritual affections are far deeper than natural; and his love is stronger who burns with heavenly love which God has kindled, than he who is influenced by earthly love only, which only nature has planted. But in the fullest sense, he who forsakes these earthly things for the sake of Christ, receives instead, God himself. For to those who forsake all for him, he is himself father, brother, sister, and all things. So that he will have possessions far richer than what earth can supply; only <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">persecutions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is a very striking addition. Our Lord here includes "persecutions" in the number of the Christian's blessings. And no doubt there is a noble sense in which persecutions are really amongst the blessings of the believer. "If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you" (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>). St. Peter, who must have had in his mind the "with persecutions" of our Lord when he wrote these words, here shows that the blessedness of the Christian when suffering persecution is this, that he has a special sense of the abiding presence of the Spirit of God, bringing with it the assurance of future glory. "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: far great is your reward in heaven." The words are also, of course, a warning to the disciples as to the persecutions that awaited them. And in the world to come eternal life. This is that splendid inheritance in which the blessed shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; and so shall possess not only the heaven and the earth, and all things that are in them, but even God himself, and all honor, all glory, all joy, not merely as occupiers, but as heirs for ever; as long as God himself shall be, who is himself "the eternal God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">will fail to receive</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#940;&#946;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(lab&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a hundredfold</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hekatontaplasiona)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1542.htm">Strong's 1542: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundredfold.
