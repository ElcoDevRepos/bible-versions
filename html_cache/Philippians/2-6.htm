The term "form" (Greek: "morph&#275;") suggests the essential attributes and nature of God, indicating that Jesus possesses the fullness of deity. This aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The concept of Christ's pre-existence is also supported by <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-17</a>, where Christ is described as the image of the invisible God and the firstborn over all creation. Theologically, this underscores the belief in the Trinity, where Jesus is fully God, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<p><b>did not consider equality with God</b><br>Here, the focus is on Christ's attitude towards His divine status. Despite being equal with God, Jesus did not cling to His rights or privileges. This reflects the humility and selflessness of Christ, which is a central theme in the passage. The concept of equality with God is further supported by <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>, where Jesus' claims to be God's Son were understood by His contemporaries as making Himself equal with God. This equality is not something Jesus needed to strive for; it was inherently His. Theologically, this challenges believers to adopt a similar mindset of humility and self-denial.<p><b>something to be grasped</b><br>The Greek word used here can mean "to seize" or "to hold onto." This suggests that Jesus did not view His divine status as something to exploit for His own advantage. Instead, He willingly relinquished His privileges to fulfill His mission of redemption. This act of self-emptying, or "kenosis," is further elaborated in the subsequent verses, where Jesus takes on human form and becomes obedient to death on a cross. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>, which states, "Though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich." This serves as a model for Christian conduct, emphasizing the importance of humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is described as existing in the form of God, highlighting His divine nature and pre-existence before His incarnation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul writes to encourage the church in Philippi, emphasizing humility and unity through the example of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

Hence it calls attention to the essential being of Christ, corresponding to the idea embodied in the name Jehovah, and thus implying what is more fully expressed in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. (2) The word "form" (which, except for a casual use in <a href="/mark/16-12.htm" title="After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.">Mark 16:12</a>, is found only in this passage of the New Testament) is to be carefully distinguished from "fashion." There can be no doubt that in classical Greek it describes the actual specific character, which (like the structure of a material substance) makes each being what it is; and this same idea is always conveyed in the New Testament by the compound words in which the root "form" is found (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>). (3) On the other hand, the word "fashion," as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1Corinthians 7:31</a> ("the fashion of this world passeth away"), denotes the mere outward appearance (which we frequently designate as "form"), as will be seen also in its compounds (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>). The two words are seen in juxtaposition in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a> (where see Notes). Hence, in this passage the "being in the form of God," describes our Lord's essential, and therefore eternal, being in the true nature of God; while the "taking on Him the form of a servant" similarly refers to His voluntary assumption of the true nature of man. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being in the form of God</span>.

St. Paul seems to make a somewhat similar distinction between the two words. Thus in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> (or its derivatives) is used of the deep inner change of heart, the change which is described in Holy Scripture as a new creation; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used of the changeful fashion of the world and agreement with it (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Then, when St. Paul tells us that Christ Jesus, being first in the form of God, took the form of a servant, the meaning must be that he possessed originally the essential attributes of Deity, and assumed in addition the essential attributes of humanity. He was perfect God; he became perfect (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). For a fuller discussion of the meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note ('Philippians,' p. 127), and Archbishop Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 70. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God; R.V. "counted it not a prize [margin, 'a thing to be grasped'] to be on an equality with God." These two renderings represent two conflicting interpretations of this difficult passage. Do the words mean that Christ asserted his essential Godhead ("thought it not robbery to be equal with God," as A.V.), or that he did not cling to the glory of the Divine majesty ("counted it not a prize," as R.V.)? Both statements are true in fact. The grammatical form of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which properly implies an action or process, favors the first view, which seems to be adopted by most of the ancient versions and by most of the Latin Fathers. On the other hand, the form of the word does not exclude the passive interpretation; many words of the same termination have a passive meaning, and <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> itself is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, and a writer in the 'Catena Possini' on <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a> (the three passages are quoted by Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loco</span>). The Greek Fathers (as Chrysostom <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.) generally adopt this interpretation. And the context seems to require it. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to an act, the act of abnegation; not to a state, the continued assertion. The conjunction "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) implies that the two sentences are opposed to one another. He did not grasp, but, on the contrary, he emptied himself. The first interpretation involves the tacit insertion of "nevertheless;" he asserted his equality, but nevertheless, etc. And the whole stress is laid on the Lord's humility and unselfishness. It is true that this second interpretation does not so distinctly assert the divinity of our Lord, already sufficiently asserted in the first clause, "being in the form of God." But it implies it. Not to grasp at equality with God would not be an instance of humility, but merely the absence of mad impiety, in one who was not himself Divine. On the whole, then, we prefer the second interpretation. Though he was born the beginning in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as a thing to be grasped, a prize to be tenaciously retained. Not so good is the view of Meyer and others: "Jesus Christ, when he found himself in the heavenly mode of existence of Divine glory, did not permit himself the thought of using his equality with God for the purpose of seizing possessions and honor for himself on earth." The R.V. rendering of the last words of the clause," to be on an equality," is nearer to the Greek and better than the A.V., "to be equal with God." Christ was equal with God (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). He did not cling to the outward manifestation of that equality. The adverbial form <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> implies the state or mode of equality rather than the equality itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Who,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8011;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">existing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hyparch&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5225.htm">Strong's 5225: </a> </span><span class="str2">To begin, am, exist, be in possession.
