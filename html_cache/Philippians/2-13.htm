The Greek word for "works" (energeo) suggests active, effective, and continuous action. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the primary agent in salvation and sanctification (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a key aspect of this work, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-11</a>, where the Spirit empowers and transforms believers. This divine work is not limited to external actions but includes internal transformation, aligning with <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit.<p><b>to will and to act</b><br>Here, the focus is on both the desire ("to will") and the execution ("to act") of God's purposes. This dual aspect highlights that God not only gives believers the desire to follow Him but also the ability to carry it out. This reflects the biblical teaching that human will is involved in cooperation with divine grace, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith is shown through works. The transformation of the will is a fulfillment of the promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>on behalf of His good purpose</b><br>This phrase underscores that the ultimate goal of God's work in believers is His own good purpose. The "good purpose" refers to God's redemptive plan, which is consistent with His character and will. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where all things work together for good for those who love God. The concept of God's purpose is also seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, where believers are predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will. This purpose is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who is the embodiment of God's plan for redemption and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

The origination of all in God, and the free action (which is in some sense origination) of man, are both truths recognised by our deepest consciousness, but to our logic irreconcilable. In one passage only (<a href="/context/romans/9-14.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.">Romans 9:14-24</a>) does St. Paul touch, and that slightly and suggestively, on their reconcilement: generally Holy Scripture--in this confirming human reason--brings out each vividly and profoundly in turn, and leaves the problem of their reconcilement untouched. Here the paradoxical form of the sentence forces on the mind the recognition of the co-existence of both. If that recognition be accepted, the force of the reasoning is clear. The only encouragement to work, in a being weak and finite like man, is the conviction that the Almighty power is working in him, both as to will and deed.<p>The word "worketh in you" is constantly applied to the divine operation in the soul (see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-6.htm" title="And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all.">1Corinthians 12:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1Corinthians 12:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-8.htm" title="(For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)">Galatians 2:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>); rarely, as here (in the word rendered "to do") to the action of men. It must necessarily extend to the will as well as the action; otherwise God would not be sovereign in the inner realm of mind (as, indeed, Stoic philosophy denied that He was). We are familiar with the influence of one created will over another--an influence real, though limited, yet in no sense compulsive. From this experience we may catch a faint glimpse of the inner working of the Spirit of God on the spirit of man. Hence, while we cannot even conceive the existence of freedom under an unbending impersonal law or force, the harmony of our will with a Supreme Personal Will is mysterious, indeed, but not inconceivable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is God which worketh in you</span>.

"Nos ergo volumus, sed Deus in nobis operatur et velle: nos ergo operamur, sed Deus in nobis operatur ct operari" (Augustine, quoted by Meyer). The grace of God is alleged as a motive for earnest Christian work. The doctrines of grace and free-will are not contradictory: they may seem so to our limited understanding; but in truth they complete and snpplement one another. St. Paul does not attempt to solve the problem in theory; he bids us solve it in the life of faith (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. he "So run that ye may obtain;" and <a href="/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy"). <span class="cmt_word">Of his good pleasure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>).
