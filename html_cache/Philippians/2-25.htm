Epaphroditus was sent by the Philippian church to assist Paul, likely during his imprisonment in Rome. This reflects the early Christian practice of sending representatives to support missionaries and leaders. The decision to send him back underscores the mutual care and concern within the early church community.<p><b>my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier</b><br>Paul uses familial and military metaphors to describe Epaphroditus, highlighting the close bond and shared mission in the gospel. "Brother" emphasizes the spiritual kinship among believers. "Fellow worker" indicates collaboration in spreading the gospel, a theme prevalent in Paul's letters (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>). "Fellow soldier" suggests the spiritual warfare aspect of Christian ministry, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where Paul discusses the armor of God.<p><b>who is also your messenger</b><br>Epaphroditus served as a representative of the Philippian church, entrusted with delivering their gifts and support to Paul. The term "messenger" (Greek: apostolos) can also mean "apostle," though here it likely refers to his role as a delegate. This reflects the early church's practice of sending envoys to maintain connections and support among distant congregations.<p><b>and minister to my needs</b><br>Epaphroditus's role included providing for Paul's physical and possibly emotional needs during his imprisonment. This service exemplifies the Christian principle of mutual aid and support, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." The term "minister" (Greek: leitourgos) suggests a sacred service, indicating that such acts of support were seen as a form of worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Philippians.

The three titles here given him are closely joined together in the original, and form a kind of climax--"brother" in a common Christianity, "fellow-worker" in the service of Christ, "fellow-soldier" in the "hardness" of daring and suffering, which the warfare of the Cross implies. (See <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Your messenger.</span>--The original word is <span class= "ital">apostle;</span> and by some interpreters, ancient and modern, it has been thought that it is intended here to designate the chief pastor--or, in the modern sense, the bishop--of the Philippian Church (as probably is the case with the "angels" of the churches in the Apocalypse); and the word "your" is then explained in the same sense as the words "of the Gentiles" in <a href="/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>. But this is very unlikely, (1) because there seems to be no example to confirm the statement that the chief pastor of a church was ever called its "apostle;" (2) because the character of the apostolate, being general and evangelistic, was very different from that of the local and pastoral episcopate; (3) because in this passage the word is inseparably connected with the following "and minister to my needs," showing the latter phrase to be explanatory of the previous word; (4) because the style of commendation in <a href="/philippians/2-29.htm" title="Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:">Philippians 2:29</a> is hardly suitable as applied to one whose office alone should have commanded respect. Our version is, therefore, correct in rendering it "messenger," just as in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a> ("the messengers of the churches"), where there is a similar reference to the transmission of alms. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus</span>; translate, <span class="accented">but I count it necessary.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> here and in Ver. 28 are epistolary aorists; they point, that is, to the time of reading the letter, not to that of writing it; and are therefore to be rendered by the English present. Epaphroditus is mentioned only in this Epistle. Epaphras is the contracted form, but the name is a common one, and there is no evidence of his identity with the Epaphras of Colossians and Philemon. He seems to have been the bearer of this Epistle. St. Paul felt that to come himself, or even to send Timothy, might possibly not be in his power; he thought it necessary, a matter of duty, to send Epaphroditus at once<span class="cmt_word">. My brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier</span>. Mark how the epithets rise one above another; they imply fellowship in religion, in work, in endurance. <span class="cmt_word">But your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants</span>. "Your" refers to both clauses; "your messenger, and (your) minister to my need." Epaphroditus had brought to St. Paul the contributions of the Philippians (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Some think that the word rendered "messenger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally "apostle") means that Epaphroditus was the apostle, that is, the bishop of the Philippian Church. It may be so (comp. <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and note); but there is no proof of the establishment of any diocesan bishops, except St. James at Jerusalem, at so early a period. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. both here and in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is probably used in its first meaning in the sense of messenger, or delegate. The Greek word for minister, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, seems to imply, like <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in Ver. 30, that St. Paul regarded the alms of the Philippians as an offering to God, ministered by Epaphroditus.
