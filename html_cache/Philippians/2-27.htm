His illness was severe, highlighting the physical dangers faced by early Christian missionaries. The phrase underscores the reality of suffering and mortality, even among the faithful. It reflects the human condition and the vulnerability of life, reminding believers of the importance of prayer and reliance on God during times of illness. The near-death experience of Epaphroditus also serves as a testament to his dedication and the risks involved in serving the early church.<p><b>But God had mercy on him,</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's intervention and compassion. Mercy here is seen as a divine attribute, showcasing God's willingness to heal and restore. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and grace, often seen in the healing miracles of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27-31</a>, where Jesus shows mercy to the blind men. The mercy shown to Epaphroditus is a reminder of God's active presence in the lives of believers and His power to alter circumstances according to His will.<p><b>and not only on him but also on me,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that God's mercy extended beyond Epaphroditus to himself, highlighting the interconnectedness of the Christian community. This reflects the communal nature of the early church, where the well-being of one member affected the entire body. It also illustrates the deep personal relationships and mutual care among early Christians, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, where Paul writes about the body of Christ suffering and rejoicing together.<p><b>to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.</b><br>Paul expresses gratitude for being spared additional grief, indicating the emotional burden he carried. This phrase reveals Paul's humanity and the depth of his affection for his co-workers. It also highlights the theme of suffering in Paul's letters, as he often writes about enduring hardships for the sake of the Gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>). The phrase "sorrow upon sorrow" suggests a cumulative effect of trials, yet it also points to the hope and relief found in God's intervention. This reflects the Christian belief in God's comfort and support during times of distress, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>, where God is described as the "Father of compassion and the God of all comfort."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/epaphroditus.htm">Epaphroditus</a></b><br>A fellow worker and messenger from the Philippian church who was sent to assist Paul.

When it was needed to be "the sign of an Apostle" (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="Greet one another with an holy kiss.">2Corinthians 13:12</a>) it was given; and at special times, as at Ephesus, it was given in "special" fulness (<a href="/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:">Acts 19:11</a>). As we note, both in the Old Testament and in the New, special epochs of miracles in the history of the Church; so it would seem there were special occasions on which miracle came out prominently in the Apostle's preaching. We may, perhaps, infer from certain points in the descriptions of the healing of the cripple at the Beautiful Gate (<a href="/acts/3-4.htm" title="And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.">Acts 3:4</a>), and at Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm" title="And there sat a certain man at Lystra, weak in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:">Acts 14:8</a>) that some spiritual intimation warned them when the hour of miracle was come. But an Apostle could not, as our Lord would not, work miracles for his own needs. Thus in this case, deeply as he sorrowed for Epaphroditus, there is no hint of his exercising that power on his behalf. He could only pray that God would have mercy on him, and thank God when that prayer was heard.<p><span class= "bld">Sorrow upon sorrow.</span>--That is, probably, upon the sorrow of captivity the sorrow of losing one who had (see <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Philippians 2:30</a>) risked his life in the ardour of service to the captive. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow</span>. St. Paul recognizes the thankfulness of Epaphroditus for the recovery of his health: he shares that thankfulness himself. Mark his human sympathies; he had a "desire to depart," but he rejoices in the recovery of his friend. St. Paul does not seem to have healed Epaphroditus. The power of working miracles, like that of foreseeing the future (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>, and note), was not, it seems, continuous; both were exercised only in accordance with the revealed will of God and on occasions of especial moment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He was sick</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;sthen&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_770.htm">Strong's 770: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be weak (physically: then morally), To be sick.
