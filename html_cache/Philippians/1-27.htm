The Greek word for "conduct" (&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;) suggests behaving as citizens, which is significant given Philippi's status as a Roman colony. The Philippians would understand the importance of living according to the standards of their citizenship, and Paul is urging them to apply this understanding to their heavenly citizenship. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, where believers are called to live a life worthy of their calling. The gospel of Christ is the good news of salvation through Jesus, and living worthy of it involves embodying Christ-like virtues such as love, humility, and obedience.<p><b>Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,</b><br>Paul expresses his desire for the Philippians to remain steadfast in their faith regardless of his presence. This reflects the early church's reliance on apostolic guidance and the need for spiritual maturity. The uncertainty of Paul's visit highlights the unpredictable nature of his missionary journeys and the challenges faced by the early church. This also underscores the importance of personal responsibility in one's faith journey, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to be watchful and stand firm in the faith.<p><b>I will know that you stand firm in one spirit,</b><br>Standing firm in one spirit indicates unity and steadfastness among the believers. The phrase "one spirit" can refer to both the Holy Spirit and a unified human spirit among the church members. This unity is crucial for the church's witness and effectiveness, as seen in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>, where Jesus prays for the unity of all believers. The early church faced external pressures and internal conflicts, making this call to unity particularly relevant. The imagery of standing firm suggests a military stance, reflecting the spiritual warfare believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>contending together as one for the faith of the gospel,</b><br>The term "contending" (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;) is an athletic metaphor, suggesting teamwork and effort in advancing the gospel. This reflects the communal aspect of the Christian faith, where believers support and encourage one another. The phrase "as one" reinforces the theme of unity, essential for the church's mission. The "faith of the gospel" refers to the core beliefs and doctrines of Christianity, which the Philippians are to defend and promote. This echoes <a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>, where believers are urged to contend for the faith entrusted to them. The early church's mission was to spread the gospel amidst opposition, requiring both individual and collective perseverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, writing from prison, encouraging the church in Philippi to live in a way that reflects the gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A Roman colony in Macedonia, where the church was established by Paul during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philippian_church.htm">The Philippian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, known for their generosity and partnership in the gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel_of_christ.htm">The Gospel of Christ</a></b><br>The good news of Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, which Paul urges the Philippians to live in a manner worthy of.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_spirit.htm">Unity in the Spirit</a></b><br>A key theme in the verse, emphasizing the importance of standing firm together in faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/conduct_worthy_of_the_gospel.htm">Conduct Worthy of the Gospel</a></b><br>Our lives should reflect the transformative power of the gospel.

Of the history of the Church at Philippi we have no historical record after the notice of St. Paul's first visit, and of the violence which he then had to endure (<a href="/context/acts/16-12.htm" title="And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.">Acts 16:12-40</a>). But in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2Corinthians 7:5</a>, written certainly from Macedonia, probably from Philippi, towards the close of the third missionary journey, we find St. Paul saying, "When we were come to Macedonia our flesh had no rest. Without were fightings, within were fears." (Comp. also <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2Corinthians 8:2</a> of the same Epistle.) It would seem, therefore, that the subsequent history of the Philippian Church corresponded only too well to the circumstances under which its Christianity first began. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only let your conversation be</span>.

St. Paul was himself a Roman citizen; he was writing from Rome; his presence the re was caused by his having exercised the rights of citizenship in appealing to Caesar. He was writing to a place largely inhabited by Roman citizens (for Philippi was a Roman colony), a place in which he had declared himself to be a Roman (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). The metaphor was natural. Some of you are citizens of Rome, the imperial city; live, all of you, as citizens of the heavenly country, the city of the living God. <span class="cmt_word">As it becometh the gospel of Christ</span>; rather, as R.V. margin, <span class="accented">behave as citizens worthily of.</span> There is a striking parallel in Polycarp's letter to these same Philippians (sect. 5). <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> literally, "If we live as citizens worthily of him, we shall also reign with him." <span class="cmt_word">That whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit</span>. The metaphor is military, and follows naturally from the thought of citizenship. Philippi was a military colony, its chief magistrates were praetors, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>), literally, "generals" (comp. Eph. 6:13 and <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Spirit is the highest part of our immaterial nature, which, when enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, can rise into communion with God, and discern the truths of the world unseen. <span class="accented">In one spirit</span>; because the spirits of believers are knit together into one fellowship by the one Holy Spirit of God abiding in them all. This distinction between spirit and soul occurs again in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>. The soul is the lower part of our inner being, the seat of the appetites, passions, affections, connected above with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, below with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="cmt_word">With one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel</span>; with one soul (not mind); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with all the desires and emotions concentrated on one object, all acting together in the one great work; comp. <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>, "Striving together with one another for the faith," rather than "striving together with the faith."
