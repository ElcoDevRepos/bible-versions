The Roman colony was known for its patriotic allegiance to the emperor, and the Christian refusal to worship Roman gods or the emperor himself was seen as subversive. The Greek word for "frightened" here is used elsewhere to describe horses startled in battle, indicating a deep, instinctual fear. Paul encourages believers to stand firm, drawing parallels to Jesus' own calm in the face of opposition (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). This steadfastness is a testament to their faith and trust in God's sovereignty.<p><b>This is a clear sign of their destruction</b><br>The opposition faced by the Philippians serves as evidence of the ultimate fate awaiting those who reject the gospel. The term "destruction" does not necessarily imply immediate physical ruin but points to eternal separation from God, as seen in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. This echoes the Old Testament prophecies where the enemies of God's people face judgment (<a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>). The assurance of divine justice is a recurring theme, providing comfort to believers who endure persecution.<p><b>but of your salvation,</b><br>The endurance of the Philippians in the face of persecution is a testament to their genuine faith and the reality of their salvation. Salvation here is not just future deliverance but also present assurance and peace, as seen in <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>. This dual aspect of salvation&#8212;already and not yet&#8212;is a cornerstone of Christian theology. The believers' perseverance is a reflection of Christ's own suffering and victory, as highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>.<p><b>and it is from God.</b><br>The source of both the believers' salvation and the ultimate judgment of their opponents is God Himself. This underscores the divine origin and authority of the gospel message. The phrase emphasizes God's active role in the lives of believers, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which attributes salvation to God's grace. It also reassures the Philippians that their trials are not in vain but are part of God's sovereign plan, echoing <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians, writing from prison to encourage the believers in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippians.htm">Philippians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in the city of Philippi, known for their strong faith and partnership in the gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/opponents.htm">Opponents</a></b><br>Those who oppose the Philippian believers, likely including both Jewish and Gentile adversaries who challenge their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A Roman colony in Macedonia, significant for its strategic location and its status as a center of early Christian activity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_and_destruction.htm">Salvation and Destruction</a></b><br>The contrasting outcomes for believers and their opponents, highlighting the eternal consequences of faith and unbelief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fearlessness_in_faith.htm">Fearlessness in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to stand firm without fear in the face of opposition, trusting in God's sovereignty and protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sign_of_salvation.htm">Sign of Salvation</a></b><br>The courage and steadfastness of believers serve as a testimony to their salvation and a witness to the reality of God's power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding the eternal consequences of faith and unbelief helps believers maintain focus and hope amidst trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_through_suffering.htm">Witness through Suffering</a></b><br>Enduring opposition with grace and confidence can be a powerful witness to the truth of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Recognizing that our ability to stand firm comes from God encourages reliance on His strength rather than our own.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Philippians_1_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Philippians 1:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_1_28_Boldness_vs_Opposition.htm">How does Philippians 1:28 encourage boldness in the face of opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_destruction_sign_for_opposers.htm">What does "a sign of destruction" mean for those opposing the gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_1_28_Faith_in_trials.htm">How can Philippians 1:28 strengthen your faith during trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Phil_1_28_Matt_5_10_on_persecution.htm">Connect Philippians 1:28 with Matthew 5:10 on persecution for righteousness.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Philippians_1_28_in_daily_battles.htm">How can you apply Philippians 1:28 in your daily spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_1_28_Fearless_in_opposition.htm">How does Philippians 1:28 encourage believers to remain fearless in the face of opposition?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_1_28_Opponents_fate.htm">What does Philippians 1:28 imply about the fate of those who oppose the gospel?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_1_28_and_salvation_link.htm">How does Philippians 1:28 relate to the concept of salvation in Christian theology?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_philippians_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Philippians 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_horror_films.htm">What does the Bible say about Christian horror movies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_fires.htm">What is the biblical perspective on house fires?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/are_jehovah's_witnesses_christians.htm">Are Jehovah's Witnesses considered Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_salvation_be_lost.htm">Can people lose their salvation?

The effect which it had on the heathen themselves is shown even by the affected contempt with which the Stoics spoke of it, as a kind of "madness," a morbid "habit," a sheer "obstinacy."
