This reflects the close relationship Paul had with the church in Philippi, which he founded during his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12-40</a>). The use of "therefore" connects this verse to the preceding passage, where Paul discusses the humility and obedience of Christ, urging believers to emulate these qualities.<p><b>just as you have always obeyed</b><br>Paul commends the Philippians for their consistent obedience to the teachings of Christ and the apostolic instructions. This obedience is a hallmark of genuine faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The Philippians' obedience is a testament to their commitment to living out their faith in a manner worthy of the gospel.<p><b>not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence</b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of maintaining their obedience regardless of his physical presence. This highlights the maturity of their faith, as true discipleship is not dependent on external supervision. It echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>, where He blesses those who believe without seeing. The Philippians are encouraged to continue their spiritual growth and commitment to Christ even when Paul is not there to guide them.<p><b>continue to work out your salvation</b><br>This phrase underscores the active role believers must take in their spiritual journey. Salvation is not a one-time event but a continuous process of sanctification. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that salvation involves justification, sanctification, and glorification (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). The "working out" implies effort and perseverance in living a life that reflects one's faith and commitment to Christ.<p><b>with fear and trembling</b><br>The terms "fear and trembling" convey a sense of reverence and awe towards God. This is not a paralyzing fear but a recognition of God's holiness and the seriousness of the Christian walk. It is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. This attitude ensures that believers approach their salvation with humility and a deep respect for God's authority and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians.

Because Jesus &#8220;humbled Himself and became obedient to death &#8212; even death on a cross,&#8221; believers are called to a life that mirrors that obedience. The word signals that the self-emptying example of Christ is not merely something to admire but a pattern we are commanded to follow (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my beloved</b><p>Paul speaks to those he cherishes in the Lord. His affection is genuine yet rooted in truth. They are &#8220;beloved&#8221; not just by Paul but by God Himself (<a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>). This reminds us that correction or exhortation comes from a place of family love, much like his description of sharing &#8220;not only the gospel of God but our own lives as well&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as you have always obeyed</b><p>The Philippian believers had a consistent record of obeying the gospel. Obedience is the natural outflow of love for Christ (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). It is never a one-time act but a steady rhythm of life, in line with <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>&#8217;s call to be &#8220;doers of the word.&#8221; Peter echoes this posture: &#8220;As obedient children&#8230; be holy in all you do&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm">1 Peter 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence</b><p>True obedience doesn&#8217;t depend on who is watching. Paul wants them to honor Christ whether he is there or not, reflecting integrity that &#8220;seeks to please God and not men&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The same thought guides Christian employees in <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>, doing their work &#8220;not only while being watched, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.&#8221; Walking faithfully when unseen reveals genuine faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>continue to work out your salvation</b><p>Salvation is received by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), yet that salvation is to be actively expressed. &#8220;Work out&#8221; means bringing the full implications of redemption into daily living, much like cultivating a garden whose seed God has already planted. We do not earn salvation; we exercise it. Paul himself testifies, &#8220;I worked harder&#8230; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>). Good works flow from saving faith (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with fear and trembling</b><p>This phrase stresses reverent awe before a holy God. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221; Such fear is not terror of rejection, for &#8220;there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>), but it is a sober awareness that we serve a consuming fire (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>). Paul urges believers to &#8220;perfect holiness in the fear of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), treating discipleship as weighty and glorious business.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Because Christ humbled Himself and was exalted, believers loved by God are called to consistent, wholehearted obedience, whether or not anyone is watching.

St. Paul passes to exhortation grounded on the Lord's perfect example. "Ye obeyed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) answers to the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Ver. 8, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> corresponds with the Savior's exaltation described in vers. 9-11. He encourages them by acknowledging their past obedience; he urges them to work, not for the sake of approving themselves to their earthly teacher, but to think of their unseen Lord, and to realize his presence all the more in St. Paul's absence. <span class="cmt_word">Work out your own salvation</span>. Complete it; God has begun the work; carry it out unto the end. Comp. the same word in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, "having done all." Christ's work of atonement is finished: work <span class="accented">from</span> the cross: carry out the great work of sanctification by the help of the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">Your</span> own: it is each man's own work; no human friend, no pastor, not even an apostle, can work it for him. <span class="cmt_word">With fear and trembling</span> (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a> and <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). "Servi esse debetis exemplo Christi" (Bengel). Have an eager, trembling anxiety to obey God in all things, considering the tremendous sacrifice of Christ, the unspeakable depth and tenderness of his love, the immense importance of a present salvation from sin, the momentous preciousness of a future salvation from death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8045;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
