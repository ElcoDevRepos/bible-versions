The power referenced here is the same power that God used in creation and in raising Jesus from the dead (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-21</a>). This power is not limited and extends to all creation, indicating Christ's sovereignty over the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). The concept of subjection is also seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27-28</a>, where all things are put under Christ's feet, signifying His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's plan. This reflects the messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, where dominion is given to the Son of Man.<p><b>will transform our lowly bodies</b><br>The transformation of our bodies is a promise of the resurrection and glorification of believers. This transformation is necessary because our current bodies are subject to sin, decay, and death (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21-23</a>). The term "lowly" highlights the humble and perishable nature of our earthly existence. This transformation is a key aspect of Christian hope, as it signifies the redemption of the body and the completion of salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>). The process of transformation is also a reversal of the curse of sin, restoring humanity to its intended glory.<p><b>to be like His glorious body</b><br>The glorified body of Christ is the prototype for the believer's future body. After His resurrection, Jesus had a physical body that was no longer subject to death or decay (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39-43</a>). This body was capable of transcending physical limitations, as seen in His appearances to the disciples (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-29</a>). The glorification of believers is a fulfillment of the promise that we will be conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). This transformation is not just physical but also spiritual, as believers will fully reflect the holiness and righteousness of Christ (1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).

It should be, <span class= "ital">who shall change the fashion of the body of our humiliation, to be conformed to the body of His glory.</span> (1) On the difference between "fashion" and "form," see <a href="/context/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7-8</a>. The contrast here signifies that humiliation is but the outward fashion or vesture of the body; the likeness to Christ is, and will be seen to be, its essential and characteristic nature. This "humiliation" marks our condition in this life, as fallen from our true humanity under the bondage of sin and death. The body is not really "vile," though it is fallen and degraded. (2) "His glory" is His glorified human nature, as it was after the Resurrection, as it is now in His ascended majesty, as it shall be seen at His second coming. What it is and will be we gather from the sublime descriptions of <a href="/context/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13-16</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-16</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>. What is here briefly described as change to conformity with that glory is worked out in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-44</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1Corinthians 15:53-54</a>, into the contrast between corruption and incorruption, dishonour and glory, weakness and power, the natural (animal) body and the spiritual body. In <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>, we read of the beginning of glorification in the spirit here; in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2Corinthians 4:17-18</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, of the completion of "the exceeding weight of glory" in the hereafter, as glorifying also "our house which is in heaven. St. John describes that glorification with brief emphatic solemnity, "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is," and draws out explicitly the moral which St. Paul here implies, "Every man that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as He is pure." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation</span>, <span class="accented">that it may be conformed to the body of his glory.</span> Compare the description of our Lord's person and work in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>. There St. Paul tells us that he who was originally in the form of God took upon him the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man. Here he uses the derivatives of the same words "form" and "fashion" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), to describe the change of the bodies of the saved at the resurrection. He had already told us (ver. 10) that the Christian soul is being gradually conformed during life unto the death of Christ. He now tells us that this conformity of the Christian unto Christ is ultimately to extend to the body. The Lord shall change the outward fashion of our body; but this change will be more than a change of outward fashion: it will result in a real conformity of the resurrection-body of the believer unto the glorious body of the Lord. <span class="accented">The body of our humiliation</span>; not "vile body." St. Paul does not despise the body, like the Stoics and Gnostics; the Christian's body is a sacred thing - it is the temple of the Holy Ghost, and the seed of the resurrection-body (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself</span>. According to the working, the energy, of his power not only to change and glorify the bodies of the redeemed, but also to subdue all things, the whole universe, unto himself.
