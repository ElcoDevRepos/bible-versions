The use of "therefore" connects this decision to the previous verses, where Paul explains Epaphroditus's illness and recovery. This eagerness underscores the importance of fellowship and mutual support within the early church. Paul's decision to send Epaphroditus back to Philippi also highlights the practical aspects of early Christian ministry, where communication and personal presence were vital for maintaining church unity and encouragement.<p><b>so that when you see him again you may rejoice</b><br>The return of Epaphroditus was intended to bring joy to the Philippians, emphasizing the communal nature of early Christian life. Joy is a recurring theme in Philippians, reflecting the spiritual fruit that arises from unity and shared faith. The phrase "see him again" suggests a previous relationship and familiarity, indicating that Epaphroditus was a beloved member of their community. This joy also serves as a testament to the power of God in healing and restoring, as Epaphroditus had been gravely ill.<p><b>and I may be less anxious</b><br>Paul's admission of anxiety reveals his deep emotional investment in the well-being of the Philippian church and Epaphroditus. This transparency in expressing personal feelings is consistent with Paul's other writings, where he often shares his struggles and concerns. The reduction of Paul's anxiety upon Epaphroditus's return suggests a mutual care and responsibility among believers, where the welfare of one affects the whole community. This reflects the interconnectedness of the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, where if one part suffers, every part suffers with it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians.

Epaphroditus' recovery and safe return would take away the "sorrow upon sorrow;" but the old sorrow of captivity, enforced inactivity, and anxiety for the condition of the gospel, would remain.
