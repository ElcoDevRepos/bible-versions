This reflects the Christian teaching that true joy is found in a relationship with Christ, not in circumstances. Paul's joy is a recurring theme in Philippians, often called the "Epistle of Joy," despite being written from prison (<a href="/philippians/1-18.htm">Philippians 1:18, 2</a>:17-18, 3:1, 4:4).<p><b>that at last you have revived your concern for me.</b><br>The Philippians had previously supported Paul, but there had been a lapse in their ability to do so. The word "revived" suggests a renewal or blossoming, akin to a plant that blooms again after a dormant period. This reflects the deep bond and mutual care between Paul and the Philippian church, which was the first European church he founded (<a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12-40</a>).<p><b>You were indeed concerned,</b><br>Paul acknowledges their ongoing concern, affirming their consistent love and support. This concern is not new but has been a continuous sentiment. The Philippians' care is a model of Christian fellowship and partnership in the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>).<p><b>but you had no opportunity to show it.</b><br>The lack of opportunity could have been due to various factors such as distance, communication challenges, or financial constraints. This phrase highlights the practical challenges of the early church in maintaining connections and support across distances. It also underscores the importance of seizing opportunities to support fellow believers when they arise, as seen in other Pauline letters (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Philippians.

At Caesarea St. Paul would have been necessarily cut off from the European churches; at Rome, the metropolis of universal concourse, he may have expected some earlier communication. But, fearing to wound the Philippians by even the semblance of reproof, in their case undeserved, he adds at once, "In which ye were also careful (before), but ye lacked opportunity.". Epaphroditus would seem to have arrived early, almost as soon as St. Paul's arrival at Rome gave them the opportunity which they previously lacked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again</span>. St. Paul thanks the Philippian Church for the gifts brought by Epaphroditus; his expressions, so courteous and yet so dignified, bespeak, like the Epistle to Philemon, like all his writings, the perfect gentleman in the best sense of the word. <span class="accented">I rejoiced in the Lord</span>; he fulfils his own precept (ver. 4). His joy rises kern the gift to the love which prompted the gift, and thence to the Divine Giver of that love. <span class="accented">Greatly.</span> Bengel says, "Hoc vix placuerit Stoico. Paulus ingentes affectns habuit, sed in Domino." The R.V. rendering of the following words is more literal: "Ye revived your thought for me." The verb is properly used of a tree putting forth fresh shoots after its winter sleep. Bengel thinks that the metaphor was derived from the season; the apostle was writing in the spring. Offsets, as Meyer, render differently, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> flourished again (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in your circumstances) so as to mind my interests." As the words might seem to imply some degree of blame, St. Paul hastens to ascribe the delay of the Philippians to causes beyond their own control. Wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity; more literally, <span class="accented">wherein ye did indeed take thought</span>, as R.V. It may be that they had no suitable messenger; but St. Paul speaks of the "deep poverty" of the Macedonian Churches in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>, where he also praises their liberality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I rejoice</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#967;&#940;&#961;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Echar&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5463.htm">Strong's 5463: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to be 'cheer'ful, i.e. Calmly happy or well-off; impersonally, especially as salutation, be well.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">greatly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(megal&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3171.htm">Strong's 3171: </a> </span><span class="str2">Greatly, very much, vehemently.
