Zeal was a highly valued trait in Jewish culture, often associated with figures like Phinehas (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>), who were known for their passionate defense of God's honor. Paul's persecution of the church is documented in <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a> and <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>, where he actively sought to imprison Christians. This persecution was driven by his belief that the followers of Jesus were blaspheming against God, a serious offense in Jewish law. His actions were in line with the Pharisaic tradition, which emphasized strict adherence to the law and the protection of Jewish religious purity. This historical context underscores the radical transformation Paul underwent after his encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>).<p><b>as to righteousness in the law, faultless.</b><br>Paul's claim of being faultless in righteousness according to the law reflects his strict observance of the Mosaic Law. As a Pharisee, Paul would have been meticulous in following the 613 commandments found in the Torah, as well as the oral traditions that were later codified in the Mishnah. This adherence was not just about external compliance but also about maintaining a blameless reputation within the Jewish community. However, Paul later realized that this legalistic righteousness was insufficient for true salvation, as he explains in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> and <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, where he emphasizes faith in Christ over the works of the law. This shift highlights the New Testament theme of righteousness through faith, contrasting the old covenant of the law with the new covenant of grace through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul was a Pharisee who zealously persecuted the early Christian church before his conversion to Christianity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>Refers to the early Christian community that Paul initially persecuted before becoming one of its most influential apostles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

What he once thought service to God was actually warfare against God&#8217;s people (<a href="/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The grace of Christ turned this persecutor into an apostle, underscoring that salvation rests on God&#8217;s mercy, not human performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As to righteousness in the law</b><p>&#8220;as to righteousness in the law&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul refers to the legal righteousness obtainable through meticulous observance of Moses&#8217; commands (<a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Zechariah and Elizabeth, who were &#8220;walking blamelessly in all the commandments&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-6.htm">Luke 1:6</a>), Paul had outward conformity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a> details his credentials&#8212;circumcision on the eighth day, a Hebrew of Hebrews&#8212;showing he met every requirement expected of a devout Jew.<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> declares that &#8220;no one will be justified&#8221; by the law; obedience, though commendable, cannot erase sin&#8217;s stain.

His flawless r&#233;sum&#233; could not deal with the heart problem of sin.<p>&#8226; By calling himself &#8220;faultless,&#8221; Paul sets up the dramatic contrast that follows in verses 7-9: everything once counted as gain he now regards as loss compared to knowing Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a> showcases Paul&#8217;s pre-conversion life: fervent zeal, fierce persecution, meticulous law-keeping, and outward blamelessness.

He shows how in this he departed from the teaching of Gamaliel, when he was "exceedingly mad against" the Christians, and "persecuted them even unto strange cities."<p><span class= "bld">Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</span>--The "righteousness in Law," which our Lord called "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees" (<a href="/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>), is the righteousness according to rule, in which a man, like the rich young ruler, might think himself "blameless," and even hope to go beyond it in "counsels of perfection"--not the righteousness according to principle, which can never fulfil or satisfy itself. While St. Paul confined himself to the lower form of righteousness, he could feel himself "blameless;" but when he began to discern this higher righteousness in the Law, then, he felt the terrible condemnation of the Law, on which he dwells so emphatically in <a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then?

As far as "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees" went, the righteousness which is "in Law," which consists, that is, in the observance of formal rules; or which is "of Law" (ver. 9), which springs, that is, from such observance, St. Paul was found blameless.
