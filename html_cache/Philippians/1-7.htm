This sentiment is rooted in their shared faith and partnership in the gospel. The Philippians had consistently supported Paul, both spiritually and materially, which justified his positive feelings. This reflects the biblical principle of mutual encouragement and support within the body of Christ, as seen in other epistles like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>.<p><b>since I have you in my heart</b><br>Paul's relationship with the Philippians was not merely transactional or superficial; it was deeply personal and heartfelt. This phrase indicates a profound emotional and spiritual connection, emphasizing the unity and love that should characterize Christian fellowship. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of emotions and will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>.<p><b>For in my chains</b><br>Paul wrote this letter while imprisoned, likely in Rome. His chains symbolize his suffering for the sake of the gospel, a theme that resonates throughout his writings (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>). Despite his physical confinement, Paul&#8217;s ministry continued through his letters and the encouragement he provided to the churches. His imprisonment also fulfilled Jesus' prophecy about the persecution His followers would face (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel</b><br>Paul refers to his role in defending and confirming the truth of the gospel message. This defense could involve both legal defenses before Roman authorities and theological defenses against false teachings. The confirmation of the gospel speaks to the evidence of its truth and power, as demonstrated through Paul's life and ministry. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, which encourages believers to be ready to defend their faith.<p><b>you are all partners in grace with me</b><br>The Philippians shared in Paul&#8217;s mission and sufferings, making them partners in the grace of God. This partnership was not only spiritual but also practical, as they provided financial support for Paul&#8217;s ministry (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-16</a>). The concept of partnership in grace underscores the communal aspect of the Christian faith, where believers are co-laborers in Christ&#8217;s work, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians. He is writing from prison, expressing his deep affection and spiritual connection with the believers in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippians.htm">Philippians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Christian community in Philippi, a city in Macedonia.

These words may be taken with the preceding, "I have you in my heart during my imprisonment and defense." So Chrysostom, whose words are very striking: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. But it is, perhaps, more natural to take them with the following. <span class="cmt_word">Ye all are partakers of my grace</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye all are partakers with me of the grace.</span> They were partakers of the grace of God given to him in his bonds and in his work. The like grace was given to them both for the passive and active sides of the Christian life - both in endurance of suffering and in propagating the gospel. Thus there seems to be no reference in the words "defense and confirmation" to his public defense before Caesar (which probably had not yet taken place), but generally to his work of preaching the gospel, which was both apologetic, meeting the objections of adversaries, and aggressive, asserting the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
