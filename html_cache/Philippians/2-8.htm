The term "appearance" suggests that while Jesus was fully human, He was also fully divine, a mystery central to Christian theology. This aligns with <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh. The historical context of the Greco-Roman world often viewed gods as distant, making the concept of a deity taking human form revolutionary. This also fulfills Old Testament prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which foretold the coming of Immanuel, "God with us."<p><b>He humbled Himself</b><br>This phrase reflects the voluntary nature of Christ's humility. Unlike earthly kings who seek power, Jesus chose the path of humility, aligning with the servant songs in Isaiah, particularly <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant. This humility is countercultural, especially in a Roman society that valued honor and status. Jesus' actions serve as a model for believers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, where He came not to be served but to serve.<p><b>and became obedient to death</b><br>Here, the focus is on Christ's obedience to the Father's will, even unto death. This obedience is a fulfillment of the law and the prophets, as seen in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-8</a>, where the Messiah delights to do God's will. The historical context of Roman rule, where crucifixion was a common form of execution for criminals, underscores the depth of His obedience. This obedience contrasts with Adam's disobedience in Genesis, making Jesus the second Adam who brings life (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>).<p><b>even death on a cross</b><br>Crucifixion was a brutal and shameful form of execution reserved for the worst criminals. The cross, a symbol of curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>), becomes a symbol of salvation through Christ's sacrifice. This act fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. Theologically, this demonstrates the extent of God's love and the seriousness of sin, as Jesus bore the wrath of God in our place. The cross is central to the Christian faith, as Paul states in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, where the message of the cross is the power of God to those being saved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, who exemplifies ultimate humility and obedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, who writes to encourage and instruct the church in Philippi.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The method of execution that Jesus submitted to, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice and humility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_empire.htm">Roman Empire</a></b><br>The ruling authority during the time of Jesus' crucifixion, known for using crucifixion as a form of capital punishment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humility_of_christ.htm">The Humility of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to become human and die on the cross is the ultimate example of humility.

From this St. Paul proceeds to the last act of His self-humiliation in death: "He became obedient," that is, to God's will, "even up to death." His death is not here regarded as an atonement, for in that light it could be no pattern to us; but as the completion of the obedience of His life. (See <a href="/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>.) Of that life as a whole He said, "I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me" (<a href="/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>); and the doing that will (see <a href="/context/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9-10</a>) ended in "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." In this light His death is the perfection of the suffering which, in consequence of the power of sin in the world, must be faced in doing the will of God (see <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>); in this light we can follow it, and even "fill up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ" (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And being found in fashion as a man</span>. He humbled himself in the Incarnation; but this was not all. The apostle has hitherto spoken of our Lord's Godhead which he had from the beginning, and of his assumption of our human nature. He now speaks of him as he appeared in the sight of men. The aorist participle, "being found (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," refers to the time of his earthly life when he appeared as a man among men. Fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), as opposed to form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), implies the outward and transitory. In outward appearance he was as a man; he was more, for he was God. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death; translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">obedient.</span> The participle implies that the supreme act of self-humiliation consisted in the Lord's voluntary submission to death. the obedience of his perfect life extended even unto death. "He taketh away [literally, 'beareth,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] the sin of the world;" "The wages of sin is death;" therefore he suffered death for the sin which, himself sinless, he vouchsafed to bear. Here we may remark in passing that this connection of death with sin must have made death all the more awful to our sinless Lord. Even the death of the cross. No ordinary death, but of all forms of death the most torturing, the most full of shame - a death reserved by the Romans for slaves, a death accursed in the eyes of the Jews (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">being found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heuretheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in appearance</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#967;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(sch&#275;mati)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4976.htm">Strong's 4976: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fashion, habit, form, appearance.
