As an apostle, Paul was a primary source of Christian doctrine and practice for the early church. His teachings were rooted in the revelation of Jesus Christ and the Old Testament scriptures. The phrase underscores the transmission of apostolic teaching, which was crucial for the early church's growth and doctrinal purity. Paul&#8217;s life was a living testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel, and he encouraged believers to emulate his faith and conduct. This reflects the Jewish tradition of discipleship, where a rabbi's followers would learn not only through instruction but also by observing the rabbi's life.<p><b>put it into practice.</b><br>Paul calls for active obedience and application of the teachings. This reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The early Christian community was expected to live out their faith in tangible ways, demonstrating the love and teachings of Christ in their daily lives. This practical application of faith was essential for the witness of the church in a predominantly pagan society. The phrase also echoes Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, where He emphasizes the importance of not just hearing His words but acting on them (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>And the God of peace will be with you.</b><br>This promise of God's presence is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, offering assurance and comfort to believers. The title "God of peace" highlights God's nature as one who brings reconciliation and harmony, both with Himself and among people. In the context of Philippians, a letter written from prison, this assurance would have been particularly comforting. The peace of God is not merely the absence of conflict but a profound sense of well-being and wholeness that comes from being in right relationship with Him. This peace is a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace." The presence of God with His people is a central promise throughout Scripture, from the covenant with Israel to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Philippians.

From the opening chapters of the letter they had &#8220;learned&#8221; about Christ&#8217;s humble incarnation (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>) and the surpassing worth of knowing Him (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). Similar continuity appears in <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10-14</a>, where Paul says, &#8220;You&#8230; have followed my teaching, my conduct, my purpose&#8221;. Learning, in Scripture, is never merely academic; it is the foundation for living.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or received</b><p>To &#8220;receive&#8221; is to welcome teaching as authoritative and binding.

The Philippians likewise received gospel truth when Lydia opened her heart (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>).
