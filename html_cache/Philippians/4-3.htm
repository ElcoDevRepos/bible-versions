The term "yokefellow" suggests a close partnership, akin to oxen yoked together for plowing, symbolizing shared labor and mutual support in ministry. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian work and the importance of collaboration in spreading the gospel.<p><b>to help these women who have contended at my side for the gospel</b><br>Paul acknowledges the significant role of women in the early church, highlighting their active participation in evangelism and ministry. The phrase "contended at my side" suggests a struggle or effort, indicating that these women were not merely passive supporters but active participants in the mission. This aligns with other New Testament references to women in ministry, such as Priscilla (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>) and Phoebe (<a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1</a>).<p><b>along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers</b><br>Clement is mentioned here as a fellow worker, suggesting he was a prominent figure in the Philippian church. Some traditions associate him with Clement of Rome, an early church father, though this is not definitively proven. The mention of "fellow workers" underscores the collaborative nature of Paul's ministry and the diverse group of individuals who contributed to the early church's growth.<p><b>whose names are in the Book of Life</b><br>The "Book of Life" is a biblical metaphor for God's record of those who are saved. It appears in both the Old and New Testaments, including <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5 and 20</a>:12, symbolizing eternal life and divine assurance. This phrase offers comfort and assurance to believers, affirming their salvation and eternal security in Christ.

Now he turns to the whole congregation and says, &#8220;Yes, and I ask you,&#8221; showing that peacemaking is a shared duty (<a href="/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; His tone is warm rather than authoritarian, echoing the way he &#8220;appealed&#8221; rather than &#8220;commanded&#8221; in <a href="/philemon/1-8.htm">Philemon 1:8-9</a>. Unity is nurtured through gracious requests, not harsh orders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my true yokefellow</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Yokefellow&#8221; pictures two oxen pulling the same load.

Genuine co-laborers stand out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to help these women</b><p>&#8226; The help sought is practical, restoring peace and ensuring Euodia and Syntyche are supported, not sidelined (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul values women&#8217;s contributions. His letters regularly name women who serve&#8212;Priscilla, Phoebe, Mary, Tryphena, Tryphosa (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1-6</a>).

It is, <span class= "ital">I ask, </span>or <span class= "ital">request.</span> The word means properly, to ask a question; secondarily, to make a request on equal terms, as of right. Hence never used (except, perhaps, in <a href="/1_john/5-16.htm" title="If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not to death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.">1John 5:16</a>) of prayer from us to God.<p><span class= "bld">True yokefellow,--</span>This obscure phrase has greatly exercised conjecture. (1) It is curious historically to note the opinion, as old as Clement of Alexandria, that St. Paul referred to his own wife; but the opinion is clearly untenable in the face of <a href="/1_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.">1Corinthians 7:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1Corinthians 9:5</a>. (2) The word is never elsewhere applied by St. Paul to a fellow-Christian, and must denote some peculiar fellowship. Many guesses as to its meaning have been made. Some refer it to St. Luke, who seems to be in the history closely connected with Philippi; others to Lydia, the first-fruits of the gospel in that city. Perhaps the most likely supposition is that it may refer to Epaphroditus, the bearer, perhaps the amanuensis, of the Epistle, who had certainly come to help St. Paul to bear his yoke of suffering, and in whose case the sudden address in the second person would cause no ambiguity. (3) But a not improbable conjecture is that the word is a proper name--"Syzygus"--a'name, it is true, not actually known--and that the word "true" (properly, <span class= "ital">genuine</span>) means "Syzygus, rightly so-called." It is obvious to compare the play on the name "Onesimus," in <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm" title="Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:">Philemon 1:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Those women . . .</span>--It should be, <span class= "ital">help them</span> (Euodia and Syntyche), <span class= "ital">inasmuch as they laboured with me.</span> The word "laboured" signifies "joined with me in my struggle," and probably refers to something more than ordinary labour, in the critical times of suffering at Philippi.<p><span class= "bld">Clement.</span>--From the time of Origen downwards this Clement has been identified with the famous Clement, bishop of Rome, and author of the well-known <span class= "ital">Epistle to the Church at Corinth, </span>of whom Irenaeus expressly says that he had seen and been in company with "the blessed Apostles," and who in his Epistle refers emphatically to the examples both of St. Peter and St. Paul, as belonging to the times "very near at hand;" but dwells especially on St. Paul, "as seven times a prisoner in chains, exiled, stoned," "a herald of the gospel in the East and the West," "a teacher of righteousness to the whole world," and one who "penetrated to the farthest border of the West." (See his <span class= "ital">Epistle, </span>Php. 5) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>, with R.V. and the best manuscripts; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is a particle of earnest appeal (comp. <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm">Philemon 1:20</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>); <span class="accented">I ask or request.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> is used in New Testament Greek (in classical Greek it means "to inquire") of requests addressed to an equal; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> is used in addressing a superior (comp. Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 40.). Who was the "true yokefellow"? Some, following Clement of Alexandria, interpret the words of a supposed wife of St. Paul. But the Greek adjective has the masculine termination; and it is plain, from <a href="/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>, that St. Paul was unmarried. Others take one of the Greek words as the proper name of the person addressed, Syzygus or Gnesius. On the first supposition, the play on the meaning of <span class="accented">S</span>y<span class="accented">zygus</span>, yokefellow, would resemble St. Paul's reference to Onesimus in <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a>. But neither of these words seems to occur as a proper name. Some again, as Chrysostom, interpret the word of the husband of Euodia or Syntyche: this does not seem likely. Others think that Lydia may be addressed here. The omission of her name is remarkable; but she may bare been dead or no longer resident at Philippi. Others understand the chief pastor of the Church at Philippi, who may very possibly have been Epaphroditus himself, the bearer of the letter. This, on the whole, seems the most probable conjecture. The omission of the name implies that the person addressed was in a conspicuous position, so that there was no danger of mistakes. An important duty is assigned to him. And it may be that the word "yokefellow," as distinguished from "fellow-laborer," denotes something more of equality with the apostle<span class="cmt_word">. Help those women which labored with me in the gospel</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">help those women</span>, <span class="accented">for they labored with me.</span> Help Euodia and Syntyche towards a mutual reconciliation, and that, inasmuch as they labored in the gospel<span class="cmt_word">. With Clement also</span>. Are these words to be connected with "help" or with labored"? Is Clement associated with the "true yokefellow" in the work of reconciliation, or with the women who labored with St. Paul? The balance of probability seems to be in favor of the first alternative; there appears to be no reason for mentioning Clement's labors in this place; while, on the other hand, St. Paul's anxiety for the reconciliation of Euodia and Syntyehe might naturally urge him to ask for the combined efforts of all his fellow-laborers. Whether this Clement is to be identified with St. Clement the Bishop of Rome is an open question; there are no sufficient data for deciding it (see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note). <span class="cmt_word">And with other my fellow-laborers</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">and the rest of my fellow-workers.</span> St. Paul appeals to them all. <span class="cmt_word">Whose names are in the book of life</span>. St. Paul does not mention their names; there is no need that he should do so - they are written in heaven (comp. <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; and Revelation, <span class="accented">passim</span>). The book of life is the roll of the citizens of the heavenly kingdom. The passages quoted do not necessarily involve the doctrine of an unconditional, irreversible predestination, or the phrase, "to blot out of my hook," could not be used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Yes,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3483.htm">Strong's 3483: </a> </span><span class="str2">Yes, certainly, even so.
