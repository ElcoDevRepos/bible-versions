His "proven worth" refers to his consistent faithfulness and dedication to the ministry. Timothy was a native of Lystra, a city in Asia Minor, and was well-regarded by the believers there (<a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1-2</a>). His mother was Jewish, and his father was Greek, which gave him a unique cultural perspective that was beneficial in ministering to both Jews and Gentiles. Timothy's character and commitment were evident through his actions and the trust Paul placed in him, as seen in other letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p><b>that as a child with his father</b><br>This phrase highlights the close, familial relationship between Paul and Timothy. In the ancient world, the father-son relationship was one of mentorship and apprenticeship, where the son would learn a trade or skill from the father. Paul, as a spiritual father, mentored Timothy in the faith and ministry. This relationship is echoed in other scriptures where Paul refers to Timothy as his "true son in the faith" (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). The imagery of a child with his father also reflects the biblical theme of discipleship and spiritual inheritance.<p><b>he has served with me</b><br>Timothy's service alongside Paul was marked by humility and dedication. The Greek word for "served" here implies a bond-servant or slave, indicating Timothy's willingness to submit to the mission and authority of the gospel. This service was not just in word but in action, as Timothy accompanied Paul on various missionary journeys and was entrusted with significant responsibilities, such as delivering letters and overseeing churches (<a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p><b>to advance the gospel</b><br>The advancement of the gospel was the central mission of Paul and his companions. This phrase underscores the active and intentional effort to spread the message of Jesus Christ. The gospel's advancement involved preaching, teaching, and establishing churches across the Roman Empire. Timothy's role in this mission was crucial, as he was often sent to places where Paul could not go, ensuring the continuity and growth of the early Christian movement. This mission aligns with the Great Commission given by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, emphasizing the call to make disciples of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young disciple and close companion of the Apostle Paul, known for his sincere faith and dedication to the gospel.

They have seen it. <a href="/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a> records how Timothy first joined Paul on the very journey that birthed the Philippian church, so his life has been on display before them from day one. Just as Paul could say to the Thessalonians, &#8220;You yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not in vain&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1-2</a>), he can confidently say to Philippi, &#8220;You know Timothy.&#8221; Christian credibility grows in community; reputations are forged where people watch us live out the faith together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Timothy&#8217;s proven worth</b><p>&#8220;Proven worth&#8221; speaks of character tested under pressure and found genuine.<p>&#8226; Paul had earlier called Timothy &#8220;my beloved and faithful child in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Years later he would urge others, &#8220;Let no one despise your youth&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>), because Timothy&#8217;s life already supplied the evidence of maturity.<p>&#8226; Like silver in a crucible (<a href="/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21</a>), his faith had been refined through miles of travel, opposition, and ministry demands.<p>The Philippians had watched these tests and could verify the results.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a child with his father</b><p>The phrase pictures affectionate apprenticeship. Paul addresses Timothy elsewhere as &#8220;my true child in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>) and &#8220;my beloved child&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>). In the ancient world a son learned a trade by working beside his father; Timothy learned gospel ministry by doing it shoulder to shoulder with Paul. The relationship is warm, personal, and formative&#8212;never distant or merely professional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has served with me</b><p>Timothy is not a spectator or a junior tag-along; he is a coworker. <a href="/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a> lists him among Paul&#8217;s &#8220;fellow workers,&#8221; and <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a> explains that Timothy &#8220;is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.&#8221; Service here is active, sacrificial labor. The verb Paul uses elsewhere for &#8220;serving&#8221; often describes a bond-servant&#8217;s devotion&#8212;joyful submission for the Master&#8217;s glory. Together Paul and Timothy model team ministry grounded in shared purpose rather than rank.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To advance the gospel</b><p>All of Timothy&#8217;s proven character and father-son partnership aims at one goal: pushing the good news forward. Earlier in the same letter Paul rejoiced that his chains &#8220;have actually served to advance the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>). Now he shows that the same priority governs Timothy&#8217;s life. This echoes Jesus&#8217; commission, &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>), and matches Paul&#8217;s own heartbeat: &#8220;I do all this for the sake of the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-23.htm">1 Corinthians 9:23</a>). Success, for Timothy, is measured by whether more people hear and believe the message of Christ crucified and risen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a> holds up Timothy as a living illustration of gospel-shaped character. The Philippians know him; they have watched his faith withstand testing. Like a loyal son apprenticed to a loving father, he has stood beside Paul, serving tirelessly so that the message of Jesus moves forward. For every believer, the verse points to a clear path: cultivate credibility in community, submit to godly mentoring, labor faithfully with others, and keep the advance of the gospel as the driving aim of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philippians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The proof of him.</span>--The allusion is justified by their intimate personal knowledge.
