In the context of Philippians, maturity involves understanding and living out the principles of Christ's humility and self-sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>. The "point of view" Paul refers to is the pursuit of knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection, as well as sharing in His sufferings (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10-11</a>). This maturity is not about age but about spiritual growth and understanding, aligning with the call to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). The Greek word for "mature" (teleios) can also mean "perfect" or "complete," indicating a process of becoming more like Christ.<p><b>And if you think differently about some issue,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that within the Christian community, there may be differing opinions on certain matters. This reflects the diversity of thought and understanding among believers, which can be seen in other New Testament writings, such as <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>, where Paul discusses differing views on dietary laws and sacred days. The early church was a melting pot of Jewish and Gentile believers, each bringing their own cultural and religious backgrounds, which sometimes led to disagreements. Paul's approach is one of patience and understanding, encouraging unity despite differences.<p><b>God will reveal this to you as well.</b><br>Paul expresses confidence that God will guide believers into truth and understanding. This assurance is rooted in the belief that the Holy Spirit leads and teaches the church (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The phrase suggests a reliance on divine revelation rather than human wisdom alone, emphasizing the role of prayer and seeking God's guidance in resolving differences. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God revealing His will to those who earnestly seek Him, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask God for wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Philippi.

It is, indeed, mostly used of such maturity in faith and grace as may be, and ought to be, attained here (<a href="/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>). But, strictly speaking, this life, as St. Paul urges in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.">1Corinthians 13:10-11</a>, is but childhood, preparing for the full manhood, or "perfection" of the next; and his disclaimer of perfection above suggests that this higher meaning should in this passage be kept in view. The prospect of being "perfect" in indefectible faith or grace is the Christian's hope; the claim to be already "perfect" is always recurring in various forms--all natural but unwarrantable anticipations of heaven on earth. St. Paul, by a striking paradox, bids those who hold themselves perfect to prove that they are so by a consciousness of imperfection. If they have it not, he says, they have something yet to learn. "God will reveal even this unto them." The conviction of the Holy Ghost unites inseparably the "conviction of sin" and the "conviction of righteousness." The "judgment" of absolute decision between them is not yet. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded</span>. "Perfect" here means mature, full grown, as opposed to babes or children. The word is so used (in the Greek) in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "There is a difference," says Bengel, on ver. 12, "between the perfect and the perfected: the first are ready for the. race; the last are close upon the prize." St. Paul exhorts all full-grown Christians to imitate his perseverance; like him, to forsake any claims to legal righteousness; to seek that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ; to know Christ, to win Christ; to press ever forwards to obtain the prize. <span class="cmt_word">And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you</span>.. If only we be in earnest, pressing onwards in the Christian race with sustained perseverance, God will, by the manifestation of his Spirit in our heart, correct any minor errors of doctrine or of practice. Comp. <a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, "If any man willeth to do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God." "Otherwise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) seems here to mean otherwise thin is right, wrongly, amiss - a meaning which it has not unfrequently in classical Greek, and in our word "heterodox." Even <span class="accented">this</span>; rather, <span class="accented">this too</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> well as the one thing needful, the knowledge of Christ, which he has already revealed. Mark the word "reveal." Paul may teach, but living spiritual knowledge is a revelation from God. This passage shows that the word "perfect" is used here in a restricted sense, not of consummated holiness; as it implies that some of the "perfect" may be "otherwise minded," may be involved in minor errors. Good Christians must have that righteousness which is through faith; they must persevere: they may err in less essential points. It is a lesson of charity and humility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All of us who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hosoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
