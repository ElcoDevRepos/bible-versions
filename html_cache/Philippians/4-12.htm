This humility is not just about financial status but also about a mindset of dependence on God. The Apostle Paul often faced persecution, imprisonment, and deprivation (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>). His ability to live humbly is rooted in his understanding of Christ's own humility, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Jesus emptied Himself and took on the form of a servant.<p><b>and I know how to abound</b><br>Paul also experienced times of abundance, such as when he received support from churches like the Philippians (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). This phrase indicates that Paul was not only familiar with scarcity but also with prosperity. His ability to handle abundance without falling into pride or complacency is a testament to his spiritual maturity. The balance between humility and abundance is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8-9</a>, which warns against the temptations of both poverty and wealth.<p><b>In any and every situation</b><br>Paul emphasizes the universality of his experience, suggesting that his contentment is not dependent on external circumstances. This reflects the biblical principle that true peace and satisfaction come from God, not from worldly conditions. The phrase echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where believers are encouraged not to worry about their needs because God provides.<p><b>I have learned the secret</b><br>The "secret" Paul refers to is not a hidden knowledge but a spiritual insight gained through his relationship with Christ. This learning process implies growth and maturity in faith, as Paul had to experience various trials to understand this truth fully. The concept of a "secret" is reminiscent of the mysteries of God revealed through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>.<p><b>of being filled and being hungry</b><br>Paul contrasts physical satisfaction with hunger, highlighting his adaptability to different circumstances. This adaptability is a reflection of his reliance on God's provision, similar to the Israelites' dependence on manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). Paul's contentment in both states is a practical application of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where He declares Himself the bread of life, satisfying spiritual hunger.<p><b>of having plenty and having need</b><br>This final contrast underscores the breadth of Paul's experiences. His ability to remain content in both plenty and need is rooted in his faith in God's sovereignty and provision. This mirrors the teaching in <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-8</a>, where godliness with contentment is described as great gain. Paul's life exemplifies the truth that material wealth or lack thereof does not define one's spiritual state or relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing from prison, offering insights into his personal experiences and spiritual maturity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.

It is, <span class= "ital">in all and everything;</span> in life as a whole, and in all its separate incidents.<p><span class= "bld">I am instructed.</span>--The word again is a peculiar and almost technical word. It is, <span class= "ital">I have been instructed; I have learnt the secret</span>--a phrase properly applied to men admitted into such mysteries as the Eleusinian, enshrining a secret unknown except to the initiated; secondarily, as the context would seem to suggest, to those who entered the inner circle of an exclusive philosophy, learning there what the common herd could neither understand nor care for. A Stoic might well have used these words. There is even a touch of the Stoical contempt in the word "to be full," which properly applies to cattle, though frequently used of men in the New Testament. Perhaps, like all ascetics, they mostly knew how "to suffer need," better than how "to abound." But a Marcus Aurelius might have boldly claimed the knowledge of both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound</span>. St. Paul had experience both of sorrow and of joy, both of distress and of comfort; he knew how to bear himself in both, because his chiefest joy was "in the Lord." This abiding joy raised him above the vicissitudes of this mortal state, and gave him an <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, a Christian independence, which enabled him to act becomingly both in adversity and in prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Everywhere and in all things I am instructed</span>; literally, as R.V., <span class="accented">in everything and in all things</span>; as we say, "in each and all," in every condition separately and in all collectively.

The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means properly, "I have been' initiated." It is a word adapted from the old Greek mysteries; comp. B.C.ngel, "Disciplina arcana imbutus sum, ignota mundo." St. Paul represents the advanced Christian life as a mystery, the secrets of which are taught by God. the Holy Ghost to the soul that longs to prove in its own personal experience "what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." St. Paul frequently uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, mystery, for the truths once hidden but now brought to light by the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> The word rendered "to be full" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is strictly used of animals, and means "to be foddered;" in the New Testament and later Greek it is used also of men, without any depreciatory significance, as in <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "<span class="accented">They</span> shall be filled (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[how] to live humbly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(tapeinousthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Middle or Passive<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5013.htm">Strong's 5013: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make or bring low, humble, humiliate; pass: To be humbled.
