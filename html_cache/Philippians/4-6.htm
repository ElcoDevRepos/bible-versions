Anxiety often stems from a lack of trust in God's plan and care. In the cultural context of the Philippians, who lived in a Roman colony with potential persecution and economic instability, this command would have been particularly challenging yet comforting. The Bible frequently addresses anxiety, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers not to worry about their lives, emphasizing God's care for His creation.<p><b>but in everything</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the instruction. Believers are encouraged to bring every aspect of their lives to God, acknowledging His lordship over all circumstances. This aligns with <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, which calls for continual prayer, and reflects the holistic approach to faith that encompasses all areas of life, not just spiritual concerns.<p><b>by prayer and petition</b><br>Prayer is a fundamental practice in the Christian faith, serving as a means of communication with God. Petition, or supplication, involves making specific requests known to God. The distinction highlights both general communion with God and the act of earnestly seeking His intervention in particular matters. This practice is rooted in the Jewish tradition of prayer, as seen in the Psalms, where David often brings his needs before God.<p><b>with thanksgiving</b><br>Thanksgiving is an essential component of prayer, reflecting an attitude of gratitude and trust in God's goodness and faithfulness. This aligns with <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, which instructs believers to give thanks in all circumstances. Thanksgiving shifts the focus from the problem to God's provision and past faithfulness, fostering a spirit of contentment and peace.<p><b>present your requests to God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal relationship believers have with God, who invites them to bring their needs and desires before Him. It reflects the biblical theme of God's accessibility and willingness to hear His people's prayers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, which encourages believers to approach the throne of grace with confidence. This invitation to present requests is rooted in the understanding of God as a loving Father who cares for His children.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul was writing to the church in Philippi from prison.

The command is simple: worry about nothing, pray about everything, thank God through it all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philippians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Be careful for nothing.</span>--An exact repetition of our Lord's command, "Take no thought" (in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm" title="Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.">Matthew 6:34</a>). The prohibition is of that painful anxiety which is inevitable in all who feel themselves alone in mere self-dependence amidst the difficulties and dangers of life. It is possible to sink below this anxiety in mere levity and thoughtlessness; it is possible to rise above it by "casting our care on Him who careth for us," and knowing that we are simply "fellow-workers with Him" (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm" title="Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.">1Peter 5:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.">2Corinthians 6:1</a>). Hence the Apostle passes on at once to speak of the trustfulness of prayer.<p><span class= "bld">Prayer and supplication with thanksgiving.</span>--By "prayer" is meant worship generally, so called (as in common parlance now) because in this state of imperfection prayer must be its leading element, as praise will be in the perfection of the future. (See <a href="/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>, where "the prayers" are among the essential marks of church membership.) To this general word is subjoined the distinction of the two great elements of worship, "supplication with thanksgiving." The very expression, however, shows that, though distinct, they are inseparable. (See <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>, and Note there.) Both words "prayer" and "supplication" have the article in the original, and may probably refer to the recognised worship of the Church. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be careful for nothing</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">in nothing be anxious.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is anxious, distracting care. St. Paul does not wish his converts to be careless, but to be free from that over-anxiety about worldly things which might distract their thoughts from the service of God, and hinder their growth in holiness. Comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>, where the apostle bids us cast all our care (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) upon God. The thought of the Lord's nearness should lead us both to be forbearing in our relations to others, and also to keep ourselves free, as far as may be, from worldly anxieties. "He careth for us." <span class="cmt_word">But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God</span>. "Curare et orare," says Bengel, "plus inter se pugnant quam aqua et ignis." <span class="accented">In everything</span>; in each emergency, little or great, as it arises, pray; cultivate the habit of referring all things, great or small, to God in prayer.

The first has been defined by Chrysostom and others as prayer to obtain a good; the second, prayer to avoid an evil Better, perhaps, as most modern commentators, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is the general word, covering the idea of prayer in its widest meaning; while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a special act of supplication for some particular object of need (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 51.). <span class="accented">With thanksgiving.</span> Thanksgiving is the necessary accompaniment of prayer; it ought never to be absent from our devotions; it springs out of that holy joy which St. Paul so constantly sets before us in this Epistle as the bounden duty of Christians. St. Paul himself is an example of constant thanksgiving. All his Epistles, except those to the Galatians, 1 Timothy, and Titus, open with a thanksgiving. In the dungeon at Philippi he and Silas "prayed and sang praises unto God" (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>). Our requests, the things for which we ask, are to be made known unto God; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> before God, in the presence of God, by prayer, the general converse of the soul with God; and by supplication, direct petitions for the supply of our necessities.
