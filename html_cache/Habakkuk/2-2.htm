In the context of the book, Habakkuk has been questioning God about the presence of evil and injustice. The LORD's response signifies divine revelation and assurance. This interaction highlights the personal relationship between God and His prophets, similar to other instances in the Old Testament where God speaks directly to His chosen messengers, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>).<p><b>Write down this vision:</b><br>The instruction to write down the vision underscores the importance and permanence of the message. In ancient times, writing was a means to preserve and authenticate divine revelations. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as when God commands Moses to write the law (<a href="/exodus/34-27.htm">Exodus 34:27</a>) and when John is instructed to write the visions in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>). The act of writing ensures that the message is not forgotten and can be referred to by future generations.<p><b>and clearly inscribe it on tablets:</b><br>The use of tablets suggests a durable medium, indicating the lasting significance of the vision. Tablets were commonly used in the ancient Near East for recording important documents. This phrase also evokes the imagery of the Ten Commandments, which were inscribed on stone tablets (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>), symbolizing the enduring nature of God's word. The clarity of the inscription emphasizes the need for the message to be easily understood and accessible.<p><b>so that a herald may run with it:</b><br>The purpose of inscribing the vision is so that a herald, or messenger, can deliver it swiftly and accurately. This reflects the urgency and importance of the message. In the cultural context, runners were often used to convey news quickly across distances, as seen in the story of the battle of Marathon in Greek history. Biblically, this can be connected to the role of prophets and evangelists who are tasked with spreading God's word, akin to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. The imagery of running also suggests the active and dynamic nature of proclaiming God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the injustices he sees in Judah and questions God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who responds to Habakkuk's concerns and provides guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Habakkuk, which he is instructed to record.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tablets.htm">Tablets</a></b><br>Physical objects on which the vision is to be inscribed, signifying permanence and clarity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/herald.htm">Herald</a></b><br>A messenger who is to carry the inscribed vision, ensuring it is communicated swiftly and accurately.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/clarity_in_communication.htm">Clarity in Communication</a></b><br>God's instruction to "clearly inscribe" the vision emphasizes the need for clarity in sharing God's word.

The Lord&#8217;s answer reminds us that prayerful waiting is never wasted. &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>). Jeremiah heard the same promise: &#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>). God is neither silent nor distant; He engages His people and gives concrete direction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Write down this vision</b><p>God&#8217;s first instruction is practical: preserve the revelation in writing.<p>&#8226; Written words outlast fading memories, ensuring the message reaches future generations&#8212;just as Moses was told, &#8220;Write this on a scroll as a memorial&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Written Scripture safeguards accuracy; John received the same charge centuries later: &#8220;Write, therefore, what you have seen&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The command also honors the prophet&#8217;s role as a steward of divine truth (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Clearly inscribe it on tablets</b><p>Not just written, but clearly written&#8212;large, legible, unmistakable.<p>&#8226; Clarity eliminates confusion (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-8.htm">1 Corinthians 14:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Tablets suggest durability, echoing the stone tablets of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a>).

The vision (see <a href="/habakkuk/1-1.htm">Habakkuk 1:1</a>: <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>).

The common explanation of these words (unfortunately perpetuated by Keble's well known hymn, "There is a book, who runs may read"), viz. that even the runner, one who hastens by hurriedly, may be able to read it, is not borne out by the Hebrew, which rather means that every one who reads it may run, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> read fluently and easily. So Jerome, "Scribere jubetur planius, ut possit lector currere, et nullo impedimento velocitas ejus et legendi cupido teneatur." Henderson, comparing <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased," interprets the clause to signify that whosoever reads the announcement might run and publish it to all within his reach. "' To run,'" he adds, "is equivalent to 'to prophesy' in <a href="/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21</a>," on the principle that those who were charged with a Divine message were to use all despatch in making it known. In the passage of Daniel, "to run to and fro," is explained to mean "to peruse." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered me:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
