In Habakkuk's time, the Assyrian Empire was declining, and the Babylonian Empire was rising. This shift in power dynamics is crucial for understanding the context of the prophecy. The call to "observe" suggests a need for discernment and understanding of God's actions in history, echoing similar calls in <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>.<p><b>be utterly astounded!</b><br>The astonishment is due to the unexpected nature of God's work. The Hebrew word used here implies a sense of shock and awe. This reaction is not just about the scale of the events but also their unexpected nature. The idea of being astounded is a common biblical theme when God reveals His plans, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a> and <a href="/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, where Paul quotes this verse to describe the surprising work of God through Jesus Christ.<p><b>For I am doing a work in your days</b><br>This indicates that the prophecy is not for a distant future but will occur within the lifetime of the audience. The immediacy of God's action underscores His sovereignty and the urgency of the message. The "work" refers to the rise of the Babylonians, which would lead to the eventual exile of Judah, a pivotal event in biblical history. This aligns with the prophetic tradition of God using foreign nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria.<p><b>that you would never believe</b><br>The incredulity stems from the unexpected means by which God will act. The people of Judah would find it hard to believe that God would use a pagan nation like Babylon to execute judgment. This disbelief is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's ways often defy human expectations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>. It also foreshadows the disbelief many would have regarding the Messiah's humble origins and suffering, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>even if someone told you.</b><br>This emphasizes the extraordinary nature of God's plan, which would be difficult to accept even if explicitly revealed. It highlights the challenge of faith and the need to trust in God's wisdom and timing. This phrase resonates with the New Testament theme of the mystery of the Gospel, which was hidden for ages but revealed in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>). It also points to the prophetic role of Jesus, who often spoke of truths that were hard for His contemporaries to accept (<a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60-66</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the injustice and violence he sees in Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Habakkuk lived and prophesied, facing moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations, particularly the Babylonians, whom God would use as instruments of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_work.htm">God's Work</a></b><br>The surprising and sovereign actions of God, which are beyond human understanding and expectation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans/babylonians.htm">The Chaldeans/Babylonians</a></b><br>The rising power that God would use to execute judgment on Judah, as revealed later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses even pagan nations to accomplish His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expect_the_unexpected.htm">Expect the Unexpected</a></b><br>God's ways often defy human expectations, reminding us to trust in His wisdom and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_uncertainty.htm">Faith in Uncertainty</a></b><br>When faced with confusion or doubt, believers are called to have faith in God's ultimate plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>God's judgment is real, but it is also a part of His redemptive plan, leading to eventual restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_observation.htm">Active Observation</a></b><br>We are encouraged to be watchful and discerning of God's work in the world around us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Habakkuk_1_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Habakkuk 1:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Habakkuk_1_5_challenge_us.htm">How does Habakkuk 1:5 challenge us to recognize God's work in our lives?

They are to "wonder," not at God's choice of an agent, but at the consequences of the visitation, which resulted in the sack of the Temple, and the deportation of 10,000 captives; a work which the Jews might well not have credited, though it were told them. The words "among the heathen" (<span class= "ital">bag-goyim</span>) were, probably, misread by the LXX. translators <span class= "ital">bog</span>'<span class= "ital">dim.</span> Hence the translation, <span class= "greekheb">????????????</span>, "ye despisers."
