In the biblical context, plagues are often associated with God's intervention, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). These plagues demonstrated God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods and His ability to protect and deliver His people. The imagery of a plague going before God indicates His ability to clear the path and prepare the way for His purposes. It reflects the awe-inspiring and sometimes fearsome nature of God's presence, as He moves to accomplish His will. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His earthly ministry, demonstrated authority over sickness and disease, symbolizing His power over sin and death.<p><b>and fever followed in His steps</b><br>The mention of fever following in His steps continues the theme of divine power and judgment. Fever, often associated with illness and suffering, can symbolize the consequences of sin and the purifying aspect of God's presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, fever and disease were seen as manifestations of divine displeasure or judgment. This phrase may also allude to the aftermath of God's judgment, where the effects linger as a reminder of His holiness and justice. In a broader biblical context, this can be connected to the refining process believers undergo, as described in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God's presence purifies and refines His people. This refining is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who purifies believers through His sacrifice and ongoing sanctification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the suffering and injustice he observes in Judah.
