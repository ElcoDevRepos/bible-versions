The "foe" here refers to the Babylonians, known for their military conquests and ruthless tactics. The hook symbolizes the ease and inevitability with which they capture their victims, much like a fisherman pulling fish from the water. This imagery is also found in <a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>, where God speaks of putting hooks in the jaws of Egypt, indicating control and capture.<p><b>he catches them in his dragnet,</b><br>The dragnet is a large fishing net used to catch many fish at once, symbolizing the comprehensive and indiscriminate nature of the Babylonian conquest. This method of capture suggests that no one is spared, reflecting the totality of the Babylonian invasion. The use of a dragnet implies a systematic and organized approach to conquest, similar to how the Babylonians methodically expanded their empire.<p><b>and gathers them in his fishing net;</b><br>The gathering in a fishing net further emphasizes the thoroughness of the enemy's capture. This imagery can be connected to the parable of the net in <a href="/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47-50</a>, where the kingdom of heaven is likened to a net that gathers all kinds of fish, symbolizing the final judgment. Here, it underscores the inevitability of judgment and the comprehensive nature of the Babylonian threat.<p><b>so he rejoices gladly.</b><br>The rejoicing of the foe highlights the arrogance and pride of the Babylonians in their conquests. This joy in oppression contrasts with the biblical call for justice and mercy, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. The Babylonians' delight in their victories foreshadows their eventual downfall, as pride often precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).

God allows this temporarily as part of His larger plan, but the prophet&#8217;s graphic description assures readers that the Lord sees every cruel action and will judge it in due time (<a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They take up all men with the angle;</span> he <span class="accented">bringeth up all together with the hook</span> (<a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>) The net.
