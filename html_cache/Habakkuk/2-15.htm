In the biblical context, "woe" signifies impending doom or divine judgment. The act of giving drink to neighbors implies a deliberate intention to lead others into sin. This reflects a broader biblical theme where leading others into sin is condemned (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel and surrounding nations often involved communal drinking, but the manipulation of such practices for exploitation is condemned.<p><b>pouring it from the wineskin until they are drunk</b><br>The imagery of pouring from a wineskin suggests abundance and intentionality. In ancient times, wineskins were common containers for wine, made from animal skins. The act of making someone drunk is seen as a moral failing, as drunkenness leads to a loss of self-control and is frequently condemned in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). This phrase highlights the premeditated nature of the sin, as the perpetrator seeks to intoxicate others for personal gain.<p><b>in order to gaze at their nakedness!</b><br>The ultimate motive here is to exploit and humiliate, revealing a deep moral corruption. Nakedness in the Bible often symbolizes vulnerability and shame (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>). The act of exposing someone's nakedness is associated with dishonor and disgrace. This phrase underscores the predatory nature of the sin, where the perpetrator seeks to degrade others for personal gratification. It reflects a violation of the dignity and respect owed to others, which is a recurring theme in biblical ethics.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and judgment upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians (Chaldeans)</a></b><br>The nation used by God to execute judgment on Judah, known for their oppressive and immoral practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who communicates with Habakkuk, revealing His plans for justice and righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>Symbolically representing those who are led into sin or taken advantage of by others, often seen as victims of exploitation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_exploitation.htm">The Dangers of Exploitation</a></b><br>This verse highlights the moral corruption involved in exploiting others for personal gain.

But it may be rendered, "pouring out, or mixing, thy fury," or, as Jerome, "mittens fel suum," "adding thy poison thereto." This last version seems most suitable, introducing a kind of climax, the "poison" being some drug added to increase the intoxicating power.
