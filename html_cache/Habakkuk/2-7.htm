In the ancient Near East, creditors were often those who lent resources or money, expecting repayment with interest. The Babylonians had metaphorically "borrowed" from other nations by plundering them, and now those nations would rise against them. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. Historically, the Medes and Persians would be the "creditors" who rise against Babylon, fulfilling this prophecy.<p><b>and those who disturb you awaken?</b><br>The term "disturb" implies a disruption of peace and security. The Babylonians, who had disturbed many nations, would themselves be disturbed. This awakening suggests a sudden and unexpected reversal of fortunes, a common theme in prophetic literature where God uses the rise and fall of nations to accomplish His purposes. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of divine justice, as seen in the story of Haman in Esther, where those who plot evil find their plans turned against them.<p><b>Then you will become their prey.</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete reversal of roles. The Babylonians, once the predators, would become the prey. This is a fulfillment of divine justice, where the oppressor becomes the oppressed. It echoes the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>, "Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity." Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where the oppressor, Satan, is defeated and justice is restored. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and judgment concerning the wickedness of Judah and the impending Babylonian invasion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians (Chaldeans)</a></b><br>The empire used by God as an instrument of judgment against Judah, known for their ruthless conquests and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creditors.htm">Creditors</a></b><br>Symbolically representing those who will rise against the Babylonians, indicating a reversal of fortunes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The overarching theme where God assures that the oppressors will eventually face justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses nations to fulfill His purposes, but He also holds them accountable for their actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reversal_of_fortunes.htm">The Reversal of Fortunes</a></b><br>Those who oppress and exploit others will eventually face consequences.
