In biblical history, rivers often symbolize life and sustenance, but they can also represent obstacles or threats, as seen in the crossing of the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-17</a>). The question implies God's sovereignty over creation, reminiscent of His power displayed during the Exodus when He parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). The imagery of God being "angry" at the rivers may symbolize His judgment against the forces of chaos and opposition to His people.<p><b>Was Your wrath against the streams?</b><br>Streams, like rivers, are vital for life and agriculture in the ancient Near East. The mention of God's wrath against them could symbolize His judgment against nations or entities that oppose His will. This echoes the plagues of Egypt, where the Nile turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>), demonstrating God's power over the natural world and His ability to use it as an instrument of judgment. The rhetorical nature of the question emphasizes God's righteous anger against sin and injustice.<p><b>Did You rage against the sea</b><br>The sea often represents chaos and danger in biblical literature. God's control over the sea is a recurring theme, as seen in the creation narrative where He separates the waters (<a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-10</a>) and in the calming of the storm by Jesus (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). The imagery of God raging against the sea may allude to His victory over chaotic forces, such as the parting of the Red Sea, which allowed the Israelites to escape from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This demonstrates God's power to bring salvation through His mastery over creation.<p><b>when You rode on Your horses,</b><br>Horses in ancient times were symbols of power and warfare. The imagery of God riding on horses suggests a divine warrior motif, portraying God as a mighty conqueror. This is consistent with other biblical depictions of God as a warrior, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, where He rides on a cherub. The use of horses emphasizes the swiftness and strength of God's intervention on behalf of His people.<p><b>on Your chariots of salvation?</b><br>Chariots were advanced military technology in the ancient world, symbolizing strength and victory. The phrase "chariots of salvation" suggests that God's interventions are not only powerful but also redemptive. This imagery can be connected to the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, where God's actions led to the salvation of His people (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as a divine warrior in apocalyptic literature (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>). The chariots signify God's unstoppable force in bringing about His purposes and delivering His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is depicted as a divine warrior in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rivers_and_streams.htm">Rivers and Streams</a></b><br>Symbolic of natural elements that God controls and uses to demonstrate His power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Often represents chaos and opposition in biblical literature, which God subdues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_and_chariots_of_salvation.htm">Horses and Chariots of Salvation</a></b><br>Metaphorical imagery representing God's might and deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>The prophet who is having a dialogue with God, expressing awe and seeking understanding of God's actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all creation, including the natural elements.

These waters never suffered divine whim; they became stage props for salvation and judgment. The Lord who once rode His chariots through the Red Sea remains the same today&#8212;unthreatened by chaos, passionately committed to deliver His people, and certain to triumph over every force that opposes His righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Was the Lord displeased?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Is it</span> <span class= "ital">with the rivers Jehovah is wroth?
