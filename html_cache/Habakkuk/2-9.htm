In the context of Habakkuk, this woe is directed towards those who accumulate wealth through unethical means. The phrase "builds his house" can be understood both literally and metaphorically, referring to establishing one's life or legacy. The concept of "unjust gain" highlights the exploitation and oppression prevalent in Judah and among the Babylonians, who are the immediate context of Habakkuk's prophecy. This echoes other biblical warnings against ill-gotten wealth, such as in <a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>, emphasizing God's concern for justice and righteousness.<p><b>to place his nest on high</b><br>The imagery of placing a "nest on high" suggests a false sense of security and self-exaltation. In ancient times, building on high places was a common practice for protection against enemies and natural disasters. This phrase implies an attempt to secure one's position and wealth through human means, disregarding divine sovereignty. It reflects the pride and arrogance condemned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>, where Edom is criticized for its lofty dwelling places. The metaphor of a "nest" also evokes the idea of comfort and safety, which is ultimately illusory when founded on injustice.<p><b>and escape the hand of disaster!</b><br>The "hand of disaster" represents impending judgment and calamity, which is inevitable for those who trust in their own strength and wealth rather than in God. This phrase underscores the futility of relying on material security to avoid divine retribution. The historical context of Habakkuk involves the rise of the Babylonian empire, which would eventually bring disaster upon Judah. This serves as a reminder of the broader biblical theme that true security is found only in obedience to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/37-39.htm">Psalm 37:39-40</a>. The prophetic warning also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and deliverance found in Christ, who offers salvation from the ultimate disaster of sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions, particularly concerning the Babylonian empire.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that God uses as an instrument of judgment against Judah, known for its pride and unjust practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to its own injustices and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who responds to Habakkuk's concerns and pronounces woes against the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unjust_builder.htm">The Unjust Builder</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of those who seek security and prosperity through unethical means.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unjust_gain.htm">The Danger of Unjust Gain</a></b><br>Pursuing wealth through unethical means leads to spiritual and often physical ruin.

The expression <span class= "ital">sets his nest on high</span> finds more than sufficient illustration in the exaggerated accounts of Babylon given by Herodotus and Ctesias. The former gives 337&#171; feet, the latter 300 feet, as the height of its walls. The height of the towers was, according to Ctesias, 420 feet. There were 250 of these towers, irregularly disposed, to guard the weaker parts of the wall. The space included by these colossal outworks was, according to Herodotus, about 200 square miles.<p>The language of this verse recalls Jeremiah's rebuke of Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> There, however, the sentence is on individual sin, here it is on that of a nation personified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - &sect; 9. <span class="accented">The second woe: for their avarice, violence, and cunning.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That coveteth an evil covetousness to his house;</span> better, <span class="accented">gaineth evil gains for his house.</span> The "house" is the royal family or dynasty, as in ver. 10; and the Chaldean is denounced for thinking to secure its stability and permanence by amassing godless gains. <span class="cmt_word">That he may set his nest on high</span>.

Some see in the words an allusion to the formidable fortifications raised by Nebuchadnezzar for the protection of Babylon, and the wonderful palace erected by him as a royal residence (see Rawlinson, 'Ant.

It is certain that Nebuchadnezzar and other monarchs, after successful expeditions, turned their attention to building and enriching towns, temples, and palaces (see Josephus, 'Cont.
