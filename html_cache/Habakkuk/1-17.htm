The imagery of a net suggests a methodical and relentless approach to conquest. In the ancient Near East, fishing was a common occupation, and the net was a symbol of entrapment and capture. This metaphor highlights the Babylonians' efficiency and ruthlessness in their military campaigns. The net imagery is also used in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>, where God speaks of capturing rebellious Israel in His net, indicating divine judgment.<p><b>and continue to slay nations</b><br>The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, were known for their military prowess and expansionist policies. Historically, they conquered many nations, including Assyria, Egypt, and Judah, establishing themselves as a dominant empire in the 6th century BC. This phrase reflects the historical reality of Babylon's aggressive campaigns and their impact on the ancient world. The continual slaying of nations underscores the theme of unchecked power and the moral questions it raises, which are central to Habakkuk's dialogue with God.<p><b>without mercy?</b><br>The lack of mercy shown by the Babylonians is a significant concern for Habakkuk. In the ancient world, mercy was often seen as a virtue of the divine, and its absence in human rulers was troubling. This phrase raises questions about justice and the character of God, as Habakkuk struggles with the idea of a righteous God allowing such merciless actions. The theme of divine justice and mercy is echoed throughout Scripture, notably in the New Testament, where Jesus embodies mercy and calls His followers to do the same (<a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>). The absence of mercy in Babylon's conquests contrasts with the biblical call for justice tempered with compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the injustices he sees in the world.

Habakkuk joins that lament, but his complaint is not unbelief&#8212;he is bringing his concern to the Lord, confident God hears (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p>&#8211; The question underscores that God alone must give the answer; human power cannot stop Babylon, but divine sovereignty can (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>therefore</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; ties this verse to 1:15-16, where Babylon was likened to a fisherman delighting in his catch. Because the Chaldean boasts in his net and sacrifices to it, Habakkuk expects God to act justly (<a href="/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>).<p>&#8211; The prophet reasons from God&#8217;s holiness in 1:13&#8212;if God is of purer eyes than to look on evil, a reckoning must follow (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>empty his net</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Empty his net&#8221; pictures Babylon unloading captives and plunder so he can cast the net again.<p>&#8211; This relentless cycle of conquest recalls Assyria earlier (<a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>) and prefigures the end-time beast that devours continually (<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4, 7</a>).<p>&#8211; Habakkuk&#8217;s imagery emphasizes that the oppressor treats people as mere fish&#8212;stripped of dignity (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), violating God&#8217;s value on human life (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and continue</b><p>&#8211; The fear is not a single incursion but an ongoing campaign.

Such mercilessness stands opposite God&#8217;s revealed character (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The prophetic promise is that God will measure back the same standard: &#8220;The merciless man will be repaid&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> captures the prophet&#8217;s cry: Will Babylon forever empty its net, endlessly killing nations with no compassion? Each phrase heightens the tension between the oppressor&#8217;s arrogance and God&#8217;s righteousness. Habakkuk&#8217;s question anticipates God&#8217;s answer&#8212;Babylon will not triumph indefinitely (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3-4</a>).
