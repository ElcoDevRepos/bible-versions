In biblical times, Edom was often seen as a place of judgment and divine activity. The mention of God coming from Teman suggests a theophany, a visible manifestation of God, indicating His active presence and intervention. This echoes the imagery of God leading His people from Sinai, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where God is described as coming from Sinai with a similar display of power and majesty.<p><b>and the Holy One from Mount Paran</b><br>Mount Paran is part of the mountain range in the Sinai Peninsula, often associated with the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites. This reference connects to the divine revelation at Sinai and the giving of the Law. The term "Holy One" emphasizes God's purity and separateness, underscoring His role as the divine lawgiver and protector of Israel. This imagery is reminiscent of the Exodus narrative, where God guided and protected His people through the wilderness.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. In this context, it serves as a moment to contemplate the majesty and power of God as He reveals Himself from these significant locations.<p><b>His glory covered the heavens</b><br>This phrase highlights the overwhelming presence and majesty of God, suggesting that His glory is not confined to the earth but extends throughout the heavens. This imagery is consistent with other biblical descriptions of God's glory, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim that the whole earth is full of His glory. It emphasizes God's sovereignty and the universal recognition of His majesty.<p><b>and His praise filled the earth</b><br>The filling of the earth with His praise indicates the response of creation to God's manifest presence. This reflects the idea that all of creation is designed to glorify God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God. It also points to a future time when God's reign will be fully acknowledged by all, aligning with prophetic visions of universal worship found in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing divine intervention and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/teman.htm">Teman</a></b><br>A region in Edom, often associated with wisdom and might.

The Authorised Version has unfortunately rendered all the verbs in this section in the <span class= "ital">past</span> tense, thus obscuring the sense of the poem. They all refer to a scene really future, but brought by the grasp of faith into the immediate <span class= "ital">present.</span> In the Hebrew some of these verbs are in the future tense, others in the past used with the force of a present, the "prophetic perfect" as it is sometimes termed. Such a use of the Hebrew preterite is common in Biblical poetry, notably in the Book of Psalms. It is almost impossible to reproduce in English the slight distinction between these tenses. While, however, his eyes are thus fixed on a future deliverance, the basis of all Habakkuk's anticipations is God's doings in time past; the chief features in the portraiture are, in fact, borrowed from the Books of Exodus and Judges.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">God came</span>.--Render "<span class= "ital">God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran.

The southern country is here designated as "Teman," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Edom to the S.E., and "Paran," the mountainous region to the S.W., between Edom and Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-15.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The prophet or the congregation depicts in a majestic theophany the coming of God to judge the world, and its effect symbolically on material nature, and properly on evil men.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - In this episode Habakkuk takes his imagery from the accounts of God's dealings with his people in old time, in Egypt, at the Red Sea, at Sinai, at the Jordan, in Canaan; he echoes the songs of Moses and Deborah and the psalmist; and he looks on all these mighty deeds as antici-pative of God's great work, the overthrow of all that opposes and the establishment of the kingdom of Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="accented">Eloah</span>) <span class="cmt_word">came from Teman.</span> The words are connected with Moses' description of the Lord's appearance at Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; comp. <a href="/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). As he then came in glory to make a covenant with his people, so will he appear again in majesty to deliver them from the power of evil and to execute judgment. The verbs throughout are best rendered in the present. The prophet takes his stand in time preceding the action of the verb, and hence uses the future tense, thus also showing that he is prophesying of a great event to come, symbolized by these earlier manifestations. Habakkuk here and in <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> trees the word <span class="accented">Eloah</span>, which is not found in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or the other minor prophets; it occurs once in Isaiah, twice in Deuteronomy, and frequently in Job.

This term occurs also in vers. 9, 13, and frequently in the Psalms, but nowhere else, and indicates some change in the music when the ode was sung in the temple service. What is the exact change is a matter of great uncertainty. Some take it to indicate "a pause;" others, connecting it with <span class="accented">salah</span>, "to lift up," render it "elevation," and suppose it means the raising of the voice, or the strengthening of the accompaniment, as by the blast of trumpets. The meaning must be left undetermined, though it must be added that it is always found at the end of a verse or hemistich, where there is a pause or break in the thought, or, as some say, some strongly accented words occur. <span class="cmt_word">His glory covered the heavens.</span> His majestic brightness spread over the heavens, dimming the gleam of sun and stars; or it may mean his boundless majesty fills the highest heavens and encompasses its inhabitants.
