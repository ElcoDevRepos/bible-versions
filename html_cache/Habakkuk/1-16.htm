In the ancient Near East, it was common for people to worship the instruments of their success, believing them to be divine. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on human strength and achievements is contrasted with trust in God (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). The dragnet symbolizes the Babylonian empire's expansive and effective military campaigns, capturing nations like fish in a net.<p><b>and burns incense to his fishing net,</b><br>Burning incense was a common act of worship in ancient cultures, signifying reverence and devotion. The Babylonians' worship of their fishing net further illustrates their misplaced trust in their own power and resources. This act of idolatry is reminiscent of the Israelites' own struggles with idol worship, as seen in the golden calf incident (Exodus 32). The fishing net represents the tools and strategies that the Babylonians believed brought them prosperity, showing their failure to recognize God's sovereignty.<p><b>for by these things his portion is sumptuous</b><br>The Babylonians enjoyed great wealth and prosperity as a result of their conquests, which they attributed to their military prowess. This phrase underscores the temporary and deceptive nature of material wealth gained through unjust means. The Bible often warns against the dangers of wealth and the false security it provides (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). The sumptuous portion signifies the abundance and luxury that the Babylonians experienced, yet it also serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly riches.<p><b>and his food is rich.</b><br>The richness of the Babylonians' food symbolizes the prosperity and indulgence they enjoyed. This abundance, however, is contrasted with the spiritual poverty that comes from idolatry and injustice. The Bible frequently contrasts physical wealth with spiritual richness, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's kingdom over material gain (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). The rich food also serves as a metaphor for the temporary satisfaction that comes from worldly success, which ultimately cannot fulfill the deeper spiritual needs of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God in the face of evil and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans (Babylonians)</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for their military conquests and idolatry, often used by God as instruments of judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_net_and_dragnet.htm">The Net and Dragnet</a></b><br>Metaphors for the tools and methods used by the Babylonians to capture and subdue nations, symbolizing their reliance on their own strength and resources.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_of_self-reliance.htm">Idolatry of Self-Reliance</a></b><br>The Babylonians' worship of their nets and dragnets symbolizes a deeper issue of self-reliance and pride.

Of this statement the present verse is an expansion. Weapons of war may have been literally worshipped by the Babylonians. Similarly, the Sarmatians offered yearly sacrifices to a sword, as the emblem of their god of war (Clem. Alex. <span class= "ital">Protrept.</span> 64). The Romans also sacrificed to their eagles. But probably the language is metaphorical, and we need not seek a closer illustration than that of Dr. Pusey,--"So the <span class= "ital">Times</span> said at the beginning of the late war, 'The French almost worshipped the mitrailleuse as a goddess.'

There is no trace in the monuments of the Chaldeans paying divine honours to their weapons, as, accord-lug to Herodotus (4:62), the Scythians and other nations did (see Justin, 'Hist.,' 43:3; and Pusey's note here).
