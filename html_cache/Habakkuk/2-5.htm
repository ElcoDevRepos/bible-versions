In biblical context, wealth is often seen as a potential stumbling block, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, "He who trusts in his riches will fall." The betrayal of wealth is a recurring theme, warning against the false security it provides. Historically, many nations and leaders have fallen due to their reliance on wealth rather than on God.<p><b>He is an arrogant man never at rest.</b><br>Arrogance is a significant sin in the Bible, often leading to downfall. This phrase suggests a restless pursuit of power and status, reminiscent of figures like King Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, who was humbled by God due to his pride. The lack of rest indicates a life driven by insatiable desires, contrasting with the peace found in God (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).<p><b>He enlarges his appetite like Sheol,</b><br>Sheol, the Hebrew term for the grave or the abode of the dead, is depicted as having an insatiable appetite. This metaphor emphasizes the endless greed and desire for more, which can never be satisfied. It reflects the human condition of always wanting more, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, "Whoever loves money never has enough."<p><b>and like Death, he is never satisfied.</b><br>Death is personified here as something that continually takes but is never full. This imagery underscores the futility of trying to satisfy desires through worldly means. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of the consequences of sin, which leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), and the ultimate satisfaction found only in Christ.<p><b>He gathers all the nations to himself</b><br>This phrase can be seen as a prophecy of the rise of empires that seek to dominate and control, such as Babylon during Habakkuk's time. It also foreshadows the end times, where nations will be gathered for judgment (<a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>). The gathering of nations can be a type of Christ, who will gather all people to Himself in the final judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>).<p><b>and collects all the peoples as his own.</b><br>This reflects the imperial ambitions of ancient empires, which sought to subjugate and assimilate various peoples. It serves as a warning against the pride and self-exaltation of human rulers. In contrast, Christ's gathering of people is for redemption and unity in His kingdom (<a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>), highlighting the difference between worldly and divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the problem of evil and injustice in the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proud_man.htm">The Proud Man</a></b><br>Represents those who are arrogant and greedy, often interpreted as the Babylonians or any oppressive power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, the realm of the dead, often depicted as insatiable and ever-consuming.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Personified as an entity that is never satisfied, symbolizing the endless greed and destruction of the proud.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_peoples.htm">Nations and Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the various groups that the proud man seeks to dominate and control.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_wealth.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can lead to a false sense of security and betrayal, as it often fails to deliver true satisfaction and peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_restlessness_of_pride.htm">The Restlessness of Pride</a></b><br>Pride leads to a constant state of unrest and dissatisfaction, as it drives individuals to seek more power and control without ever finding contentment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_insatiable_appetite_of_greed.htm">The Insatiable Appetite of Greed</a></b><br>Like Sheol and death, greed is never satisfied.

For believers, the verse is a call to reject the Babylonian mindset and rest instead in the righteous who live by faith (<a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Yea, also</span>. . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">Add, too, that wine is treacherous</span> (and that) <span class= "ital">he is a braggart and cannot be quiet, whose appetite is large as</span> (that of) <span class= "ital">Hades.</span> The rest of the verse illustrates this last-named characteristic--restless, rapacious ambition. Two more charges are thus added to the gravamen of <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>. Not only are the Chaldaeans arrogant, but drunkards, and insatiably covetous. The former charge is expressed in a kind of proverb, "(It is a known fact that) wine is treacherous." Perhaps the aphorisms of <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm" title="Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whoever is deceived thereby is not wise.">Proverbs 20:1</a> are in Habakkuk's mind: "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is noisy." The other charge, that of rapacity, also recalls the Book of Proverbs, where the insatiable appetite of death and Hades is twice described. (See <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-16.htm" title="The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that said not, It is enough.">Proverbs 30:16</a>.) The charge of drunkenness is illustrated in Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> vol. 2, 504-507.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">The character of the Chaldeans in some particulars is intimated.</span> The general proposition in the former hemistich of ver. 4 is here applied to the Chaldeans, in striking contrast to the lot of the just in the latter clause. <span class="cmt_word">Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">And moreover, wine is treacherous.</span> A kind of proverbial saying (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo vinum potantem decipit.</span> There is no word expressive of comparison in the original, though it may be supplied to complete the sense. The intemperate habits of the Babylonians are well attested (see <a href="/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3, 4</a>; Quint. Curt., 5:1, "Babylonii maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" comp. Her., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5. 15). They used beth the fermented sap of the palm tree as well as the juice of the grape, the latter chiefly imported from abroad. "The wealthy Babylonians were fond of drinking to excess; their banquets were magnificent, but generally ended in drunkenness" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 3:450, edit. 1865). Neither the Septuagint, nor the Syriac, nor the Coptic Version has any mention of wine in this passage. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the arrogant and the scorner." <span class="cmt_word">He is a proud man, neither keepeth he at home;</span> <span class="accented">a haughty man, he resteth not.</span> His pride is always impelling him to new raids and conquests. This is quite the character of the later Chaldeans, and is consistent with the latter part of the verse. The comparison, then, is this: As wine raises the spirits and excites men to great efforts which in the end deceive them, so pride rouses these men to go on their insatiate course of conquest, which shall one day prove their ruin. The verb translated "keepeth at home" has the secondary sense of "being decorous;" hence the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Sic</span> <span class="accented">erit vir superbus, et non decorabitur</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as wine first exhilarates and then makes a man contemptible, so pride, which begins by exalting a man, ends by bringing him to ignominy. Others take the verb in the sense of "continueth not," explaining that the destruction of Babylon is here intimated. But what follows makes against this interpretation. The LXX. gives, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which Jerome, combining with it his own version, paraphrases, "Sic vir superbus non decorabitur, nec voluntatem suam perducet ad finem; et juxta Symmachum, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, hoc est, in rerum omnium erit penuria." <span class="cmt_word">Who enlargeth his desire as hell;</span> Hebrew, Sheol. Hell is called insatiable (<a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is as death,</span> which seizes all creatures and spares none. <span class="cmt_word">People</span>;
