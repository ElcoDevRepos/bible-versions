Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a deliverer, rescuing Israel from various oppressors, such as in the Exodus from Egypt. This action underscores God's covenant faithfulness and His commitment to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The imagery of God "going forth" suggests a divine warrior leading His people to victory, a theme common in the Psalms and prophetic literature.<p><b>to save Your anointed</b><br>The term "anointed" often refers to kings in the Old Testament, particularly those from the line of David, who were chosen by God to lead His people. This can also be seen as a messianic reference, pointing to Jesus Christ, the ultimate Anointed One, who brings salvation not only to Israel but to all humanity. The anointing signifies God's choice and empowerment for a specific purpose, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan through His chosen leaders.<p><b>You crushed the head of the house of the wicked</b><br>This phrase evokes the imagery of a decisive victory over evil, reminiscent of the promise in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head. It signifies God's judgment against those who oppose His will and oppress His people. Historically, this could refer to specific enemies of Israel, such as the Canaanite kings or later oppressors like Babylon. Theologically, it points to the ultimate defeat of Satan and evil through Christ's victory on the cross.<p><b>and stripped him from head to toe</b><br>This imagery of stripping suggests total defeat and humiliation of the enemy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, stripping a defeated foe was a common practice, symbolizing complete conquest and the removal of power and dignity. This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment against the wicked, leaving them utterly exposed and powerless. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice in dealing with those who oppose His purposes.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to indicate a pause for reflection or musical interlude. In this context, it invites the reader to pause and consider the magnitude of God's actions and His faithfulness in delivering His people. It serves as a moment to meditate on the themes of salvation, judgment, and the ultimate victory of God over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and faithfulness of God amidst the wickedness of Judah and the impending Babylonian invasion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, depicted as a divine warrior who acts for the salvation of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_people.htm">Your People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, whom He is committed to saving.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_anointed.htm">Your Anointed</a></b><br>This term can refer to the king of Israel, the nation itself, or prophetically to the Messiah, who is anointed by God for a special purpose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_wicked.htm">The House of the Wicked</a></b><br>Represents the enemies of God and His people, often interpreted as the Babylonians in the context of Habakkuk, but also symbolically as any force opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_a_divine_warrior.htm">God as a Divine Warrior</a></b><br>God actively intervenes in history to protect and save His people.

If the signification of the word "with" (<span class="accented">eth</span>) be pressed, the passage is taken to mean that, as God manifested himself in old time for the salvation of his people with his chosen "Christ," Moses; so he will hereafter reveal his power for the destruction of the Chaldeans with his chosen "Christ," Cyrus. But this is too definite, and cannot be shown to be intended. The "anointed one," again, is not the nation of Israel, for the term is always applied to a single individual and never to the people collectively; so here it is the theocratic king who is meant - first, the representative of David; and secondly, the Messiah. God reveals himself for the salvation of his people in union with the work especially of his anointed Son, Christ. This is how the passage is taken by Eusebius ('Dem. Evang.,' 4:16), <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. It must be confessed, however, that most modern commentaters translate, "for the salvation of thy anointed," taking the last expression (contrary to all usage) to mean the Israelites, as being a kingdom and nation of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). In this case the present clause is merely a repetition of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">thou</span> <span class="accented">dashest in pieces the head</span>. As in the following clause the metaphor of a house is plainly employed, "the head" must be taken for the gable or topmost ridge. "The house of the wicked" is an allegorical description of the Chaldaic dominion and its king; and the prophet declares that God will smite with destruction both the ungodly monarch and the kingdom that opposes itself. Some commentators see here an allusion to the primeval sentence (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>): others to the destruction of the Egyptians' firstborn; others to the incident of Jael and Sisera (<a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>). If the prophet's language was influenced by any of these matters, his view and his oracle are concerned with the mighty future. The LXX. has, "Thou wilt east death upon the heads of the evil." <span class="cmt_word">By discovering</span> (literally, <span class="accented">making naked</span>) t<span class="cmt_word">he foundations unto the neck</span>. "By" is better omitted. Keil supposes that "the neck" is the central part of the house, looking from the gable downwards; though why this should be so called is not apparent; and the wording of the original, "the foundations even to the neck," compels us to connect the two words together, and will not allow us to interpret "the neck" of some higher part of the building. The general meaning is plain - the metaphorical house is destroyed from summit to base, the destruction beginning at the gable is carried on to the very foundations According to this view, "the neck" should mean the very lowest basis of the walls. Henderson (after Capellus and others) suggests that we should read "rock," a word derived from the same root. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Thou didst raise chains unto the neck." It is possible that the mention of "the head," just above, has led the prophet to use the term "neck" in order to express the utter destruction of the whole body. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. Another solemn pause ensues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You went forth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1433;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the salvation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
