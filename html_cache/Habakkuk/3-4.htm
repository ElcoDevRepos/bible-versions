The comparison to sunlight suggests purity, brilliance, and the life-giving nature of God. In <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>, Moses' face shone after speaking with God, reflecting God's glory. The sun is a common biblical metaphor for God's righteousness and justice, as seen in <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>, where the "sun of righteousness" rises with healing. This imagery underscores God's overwhelming and unapproachable holiness.<p><b>rays flashed from His hand,</b><br>The depiction of rays flashing from God's hand symbolizes the emanation of divine power and authority. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, deities were often portrayed with radiant features to signify their power. The hand of God is a frequent biblical motif representing action, strength, and intervention, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God upholds with His righteous right hand. This imagery conveys the idea of God actively working in the world, executing judgment, and delivering His people.<p><b>where His power is hidden.</b><br>This phrase suggests that while God's power is evident, its full extent remains concealed, emphasizing the mystery and incomprehensibility of divine omnipotence. The hidden nature of God's power can be linked to the concept of God's ways being beyond human understanding, as expressed in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>. It also reflects the idea that God's power is not always immediately visible but is revealed in His timing and according to His purposes. This hidden power is ultimately revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God's power and glory, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God amidst the suffering of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, depicted as a powerful and radiant being whose glory and might are revealed through creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, experiencing turmoil and awaiting deliverance, which is the context of Habakkuk's prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_radiance_of_god's_glory.htm">The Radiance of God&#8217;s Glory</a></b><br>God's glory is often depicted as radiant light, symbolizing purity, holiness, and truth.

In the original passage, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, we read, "At his right hand was a fiery Law unto them" - a reference to the two tables of stone, perhaps resplendent with light. The "hand" in our text is a general expression, and is not to be taken with any special reference to lightning launched by the hand (which is not a scriptural expression), nor to works effected by God's agency, but simply as signifying that the light of his presence streamed forth from both sides, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> everywhere. <span class="cmt_word">There was the hiding of his power.</span> There, in that ineffable light, was the hiding place of his majesty.
