In biblical context, "the works of His hands" often refers to creation and God's ongoing involvement in the world. <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> describes the creation as an act of divine craftsmanship, underscoring the truth and justice inherent in God's design. The terms "truth" and "justice" are central to God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a "God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He." This reflects the consistency and righteousness of God's actions throughout history, from the deliverance of Israel from Egypt to the establishment of His laws. Archaeological findings, such as ancient law codes, highlight the distinctiveness of biblical justice compared to surrounding cultures, emphasizing fairness and protection for the vulnerable.<p><b>all His precepts are trustworthy.</b><br>God's precepts, or commandments, are reliable and worthy of trust. This phrase underscores the dependability of God's word, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>, which states, "The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the soul." The trustworthiness of God's precepts is a recurring theme in Scripture, affirming that His laws are not arbitrary but rooted in His unchanging nature. Historically, the Israelites were called to live by these precepts, which set them apart from other nations. The reliability of God's word is further affirmed in the New Testament, where Jesus, in <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, declares that not the smallest letter or stroke of the law will disappear until everything is accomplished. This points to the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ, who embodies the truth and justice of God's precepts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/111.htm">Psalm 111</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who praises the works and character of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose works and precepts are being described as truthful and just.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalmist is writing, reminding them of God's faithfulness and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works_of_god.htm">The Works of God</a></b><br>Refers to God's creation, providence, and acts of salvation throughout history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_precepts_of_god.htm">The Precepts of God</a></b><br>The laws, commandments, and teachings given by God, which are reliable and trustworthy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_works_reflect_his_character.htm">God's Works Reflect His Character</a></b><br>The works of God are inherently truthful and just, reflecting His perfect nature.
