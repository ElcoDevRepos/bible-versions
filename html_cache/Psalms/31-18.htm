In biblical context, lying lips are often associated with deceit and slander, which are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). The psalmist's request for silence suggests a desire for truth and justice to prevail. Historically, false accusations were a serious threat in ancient Israel, where community reputation was vital. This plea reflects a deep trust in God as the ultimate judge who can silence deceit.<p><b>lips that speak with arrogance against the righteous,</b><br>Arrogance in speech is a recurring theme in the Bible, often linked to pride and self-exaltation (<a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>). The righteous, those who live in accordance with God's will, are frequently targets of such arrogance. This reflects the spiritual battle between good and evil, where the righteous are often maligned by those who oppose God's ways. The psalmist's concern highlights the tension between the faithful and the wicked, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Jesus warns against the persecution of the righteous (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).<p><b>full of pride and contempt.</b><br>Pride and contempt are attitudes that God opposes, as seen in numerous biblical passages (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). These traits are often associated with those who reject God's authority and elevate themselves above others. In the cultural context of the psalm, such attitudes would disrupt community harmony and justice. The psalmist's lament over these attitudes underscores the moral and spiritual decay that can arise from pride, contrasting with the humility and righteousness that God desires. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where God will humble the proud and exalt the humble (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing a plea for deliverance from his enemies and those who speak falsely against him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Refers to those who are in right standing with God, often facing opposition from the wicked.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who speak with arrogance and contempt, opposing the righteous and God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to build up or destroy.
