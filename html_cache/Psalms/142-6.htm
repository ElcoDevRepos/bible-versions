In the biblical context, crying out to God is a common expression of dependence and faith, seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>, <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>). It signifies a deep, heartfelt prayer, often in times of distress. The act of crying out is not just about vocalizing needs but is a demonstration of trust in God's ability to hear and respond.<p><b>for I am brought quite low</b><br>The psalmist acknowledges a state of deep humility and desperation. This phrase indicates a period of intense personal suffering or oppression, which is a recurring theme in David's life, particularly during his time fleeing from King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>). The expression of being "brought low" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who humbled Himself and experienced suffering (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). It highlights the human condition of vulnerability and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Rescue me from my pursuers</b><br>David often faced literal enemies, such as Saul and his army, who sought his life. This plea for rescue is both a request for physical deliverance and a metaphor for spiritual salvation. The concept of God as a rescuer is prevalent throughout the Bible, with God delivering Israel from Egypt (Exodus 14) and ultimately providing salvation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>). The term "pursuers" can also symbolize spiritual adversaries, aligning with New Testament teachings on spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>for they are too strong for me</b><br>This admission of weakness underscores the psalmist's reliance on God's strength rather than his own. It reflects the biblical principle that God's power is made perfect in human weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). Historically, David faced formidable foes, yet he consistently turned to God for strength and victory. This phrase also points to the ultimate victory over sin and death achieved through Christ, who conquered what humanity could not (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often found himself in dire situations, pursued by enemies such as King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cave_of_adullam.htm">Cave of Adullam</a></b><br>A possible setting for this psalm, where David sought refuge while fleeing from Saul, highlighting his sense of isolation and desperation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pursuers.htm">Pursuers</a></b><br>Represents the enemies or adversaries that David faced, symbolizing any overwhelming force or situation in a believer's life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate rescuer and listener of David's cries, representing divine intervention and support.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of crying out to God, which is central to this psalm and reflects a deep reliance on divine help.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_our_weakness.htm">Acknowledging Our Weakness</a></b><br>Recognize that, like David, we often face situations that are too strong for us to handle alone.

David, hiding from Saul in a cave (<a href="/bsb/psalms/142.htm">Psalm 142</a> superscript), refuses silent resignation. He speaks&#8212;expecting God to hear.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> says, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears.&#8221; That same assurance beats in David&#8217;s heart.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a> echoes, &#8220;Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer.&#8221; Repetition across the Psalms shows that calling out is not desperation alone; it is worshipful dependence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a> reinforces God&#8217;s open ear: &#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you.&#8221; The verse invites every believer today to voice need, not muzzle it.<p>David&#8217;s first move, then, is vocal faith: God is listening, so I will speak.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I am brought quite low</b><p>The confession follows: &#8220;for I am brought quite low&#8221;.
