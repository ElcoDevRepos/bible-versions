Biblically, wealth is often seen as a temporary and unreliable source of security. In the context of ancient Israel, wealth was typically measured in terms of livestock, land, and precious metals. Trusting in wealth is cautioned against in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, which states, "He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf." This reflects a broader biblical theme that true security and salvation come from God, not material wealth. Jesus also addresses this in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<p><b>and boast in their great riches.</b><br>Boasting in riches is a demonstration of pride and self-reliance, which is contrary to the humility and dependence on God that Scripture advocates. In the cultural context of the psalm, boasting was a way to assert one's status and power, often leading to social inequality and injustice. The Bible consistently warns against pride, as seen in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." This phrase also connects to the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where Jesus illustrates the futility of hoarding wealth without being "rich toward God." The emphasis is on the transient nature of earthly riches and the eternal value of spiritual wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_korah.htm">Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/49.htm">Psalm 49</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the psalm was originally addressed, serving as a reminder of the futility of trusting in material wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich.htm">The Rich</a></b><br>A general reference to those who place their trust in wealth and material possessions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Implicitly contrasted with the rich, representing those who may not have material wealth but can have spiritual riches.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afterlife.htm">The Afterlife</a></b><br>An underlying theme in the psalm, pointing to the eternal consequences of earthly actions and attitudes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_security_in_wealth.htm">The Illusion of Security in Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can create a false sense of security, leading individuals to trust in their riches rather than in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Boasting in riches can lead to pride, which distances us from God and others.

Boasting reveals the heart&#8217;s treasure (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a> warns, &#8220;Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom nor the strong man of his strength nor the rich man of his riches.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a> pictures the arrogant man who &#8220;trusted in the abundance of his riches&#8221; and made wealth his stronghold.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13&#8211;16</a> confronts merchants who brag about tomorrow&#8217;s profits, calling such boasting &#8220;evil&#8221; because life is a vapor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24&#8211;25</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;How hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God,&#8221; underscoring that proud confidence in money bars the door to grace.<p>Boasting in riches is more than bad taste; it is idolatry. It shifts glory from God, the true Provider (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>), to the creaturely work of human hands. The psalm reminds us that bragging about wealth cannot hide the reality that, as v. 10 notes, &#8220;everyone must die.&#8221; Eternal worth is found only in knowing the Redeemer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a> exposes two linked sins: relying on wealth for safety and exalting it as a badge of honor. The rest of the psalm, reinforced by passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15&#8211;21</a>, and <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, shows that money cannot redeem a soul, extend a life, or satisfy God&#8217;s justice. Trust and glory belong to the Lord alone; all earthly riches fade, but those who seek Him &#8220;will receive the crown of life&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">They that</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the rogues implied in the last verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that trust in their wealth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even of them that trust in their wealth.</span> The sense runs on from the preceding verse (so Hengstenberg and Professor Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches</span>.
