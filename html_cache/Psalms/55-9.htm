The psalmist, David, is calling upon God to intervene in a similar manner against his enemies. This plea reflects a desire for divine justice and intervention, recognizing that God has the power to disrupt the plans of the wicked. The confusion of speech can also symbolize the breakdown of communication and unity among those who plot evil, leading to their eventual downfall. This request for divine intervention highlights the belief in God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to protect His people by disrupting the plans of their adversaries.<p><b>for I see violence and strife in the city</b><br>David is likely referring to Jerusalem, a city that holds significant historical and spiritual importance. During his reign, David faced numerous internal conflicts, including the rebellion led by his son Absalom (2 Samuel 15). The mention of violence and strife suggests a period of turmoil and unrest, possibly linked to betrayal and political intrigue. This reflects the broader theme of the psalms, where the righteous often find themselves surrounded by wickedness and seek God's deliverance. The city, as a center of religious and political life, becomes a microcosm of the larger spiritual battle between good and evil. This phrase also resonates with the prophetic vision of peace and righteousness that will ultimately prevail in the city of God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, who is expressing his distress and calling upon God for intervention against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The adversaries of David, who are causing violence and strife, likely within the city of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David observes violence and strife, representing a place of both physical and spiritual significance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one whom David calls upon to intervene and bring confusion to the plans of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence_and_strife.htm">Violence and Strife</a></b><br>The conditions present in the city, which are the result of the actions of the wicked and are the focus of David's lament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_in_times_of_distress.htm">The Power of Prayer in Times of Distress</a></b><br>David's immediate response to turmoil is to pray.
