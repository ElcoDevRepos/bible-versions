The "voice" refers to the silent testimony of the heavens and the earth, which declare the glory of God without words. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where Paul states that God's invisible qualities are clearly seen in creation, leaving humanity without excuse. The idea of a universal proclamation aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations. The psalmist underscores that God's revelation is not limited to a specific people or region but is accessible to all humanity.<p><b>their words to the ends of the world</b><br>The "words" here symbolize the message conveyed by the natural world, which reaches every corner of the earth. This reflects the omnipresence of God's communication through creation, as seen in <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>, where God did not leave Himself without witness. The phrase suggests that the testimony of creation is as far-reaching as the ends of the world, indicating the comprehensive nature of God's revelation. This universality prefigures the spread of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, where Paul speaks of the gospel being proclaimed to every creature under heaven.<p><b>In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun</b><br>This imagery of God pitching a tent for the sun highlights His sovereignty and creative power. The "tent" suggests a temporary dwelling, indicating the sun's daily journey across the sky. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the cosmos, where the sun was seen as a divine entity traversing the heavens. The sun's regularity and reliability point to God's order and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>, where God promises the continuity of day and night. The sun is also a type of Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness" in <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>, symbolizing Jesus' role as the light of the world, bringing life and truth to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

Creation&#8217;s display is constant, universal, and intelligible to every culture.<p>- Cross references reinforce the worldwide reach of this testimony:<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;For since the creation of the world God&#8217;s invisible qualities&#8230; have been clearly seen&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>&#8212;Paul quotes this very line to show that the gospel message, like creation&#8217;s witness, is meant for all nations.<p>- Practically, this means no one can claim ignorance of God&#8217;s existence; every sunrise, starry night, and changing season &#8220;speaks.&#8221;<p>- The verse encourages boldness in sharing the gospel: if the heavens broadcast God&#8217;s glory nonstop, believers can echo that declaration in words and deeds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their words to the ends of the world</b><p>- &#8220;Words&#8221; sharpen the idea of communication: creation articulates truths about God&#8217;s power, order, and goodness.<p>- This reach is total&#8212;&#8220;the ends of the world&#8221;&#8212;mirroring passages such as <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a> (&#8220;He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven&#8230;&#8221;) and <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a> (an angel with &#8220;the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe&#8230;&#8221;).<p>- The line also foreshadows the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>). God&#8217;s design is global; our mission field is the same scope.<p>- For daily life: every corner of the planet, from urban centers to remote villages, is already primed by creation&#8217;s sermon for the message of Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun</b><p>- The imagery pictures God as a master architect who sets up a &#8220;tent,&#8221; a fixed dwelling, for the sun to rise and move.<p>- <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a> describes God placing the sun, moon, and stars &#8220;to govern the day and the night.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a> calls God &#8220;He who stretches out the heavens like a tent.&#8221;<p>- The sun&#8217;s predictable circuit (expanded in <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5-6</a>) showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness and sovereignty. As sure as sunrise, His promises stand (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p>- The metaphor also highlights God&#8217;s care: just as a tent shelters, God orders the cosmos for human flourishing&#8212;light, warmth, seasons, agriculture (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> celebrates the universal, wordless proclamation of God&#8217;s glory through creation. The heavens speak, their message spans the globe, and the sun&#8217;s daily journey underscores God&#8217;s ordered care. This ever-present witness leaves humanity without excuse and invites believers to join the chorus by taking the gospel to every nation with confidence and joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Their line.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">kav, </span>a cord, used of a plummet line (<a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem.">Zechariah 1:16</a>); a measuring cord (<a href="/jeremiah/31-39.htm" title="And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it on the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.">Jeremiah 31:39</a>, where also same verb, <span class= "ital">gone forth</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a>, the word is used ethically for a definition or law. But neither of these seems very appropriate here. The verse wants <span class= "ital">sound </span>or <span class= "ital">voice, </span>and words of this intention actually appear in the LXX., Vulg., Symmachus, Jerome, and the Syriac.<p>The use which St. Paul makes of these words (<a href="/romans/10-18.htm" title="But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.">Romans 10:18</a>) is as natural as striking. The march of truth has always been compared to the spread of light. But the allegorical interpretation based on the quotation, making the heavens a figure of the Church and the sun of the Gospel, loses the force and beauty of the Apostle's application.<p><span class= "bld">In them hath . . .</span>--This clause is not only rightly joined to <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.

It is much disputed what "their <span class="accented">line"</span> means. The word used, <span class="accented">qav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span>), means, ordinarily, a "measuring-line" (<a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>: <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, etc.), whence it comes to have the further sense of a terminus or boundary; that which the measuring-line marks out. It is also thought to have signified an architect's rule; and, hence, anything regulative, as a decree, precept, or law (see <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>). The LXX. translated it in this place by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a musical sound;" and Dr. Kay supposes "the regulative chord," or "key-note." to be intended. Perhaps "decree" would be in this place the best rendering, since it would suit the "words" (<span class="accented">minim</span>) of the second clause. The "decree" of the heavens is one proclaiming the glory of God, and the duty of all men to worship him. <span class="cmt_word">And their words to the end of the world</span>. Though they have neither speech nor language, nor any articulate words, yet they have "words" in a certain sense. <span class="accented">Millim is</span> said to be used of thoughts just shaping themselves into language, but not yet uttered (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun</span>. God has made the heavens the sun's dwelling-place, the place where he passes the day. There is, perhaps, a tacit allusion to the Shechinah, which dwelt in the tabernacle of the congregation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/19-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">their voice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(qaw&#183;w&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
