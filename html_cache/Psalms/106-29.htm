The context is the wilderness period after the Exodus, where the Israelites often turned to idol worship, such as the incident with the golden calf (Exodus 32). Their deeds included not only idolatry but also grumbling and rebellion against God's appointed leaders, Moses and Aaron. This behavior is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God despite witnessing His miracles. The provocation of God&#8217;s anger is a reminder of His holiness and the expectation of obedience from His people. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned against grieving the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>).<p><b>and a plague broke out among them</b><br>The breaking out of a plague is a direct consequence of the Israelites' sin, illustrating the seriousness of disobedience to God. In <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, a plague struck the Israelites as a result of their immorality and idolatry with the Moabite women, which was instigated by Balaam's counsel (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). This event underscores the concept of divine retribution, where God disciplines His people to bring them back to righteousness. Plagues in the Bible often serve as both judgment and a call to repentance. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus takes upon Himself the ultimate plague of sin, offering redemption and healing to those who believe in Him (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). The breaking out of the plague also serves as a historical reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon their faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.
