In biblical context, the idea of sins remaining before the LORD suggests a call for accountability and judgment. Theologically, it aligns with the concept of God's omniscience and righteousness, where nothing is hidden from His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The psalmist's request is rooted in the belief that God is a just judge who will not overlook iniquity (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). This plea can be seen as an invocation for God to act in accordance with His holy nature, ensuring that justice prevails.<p><b>that He may cut off their memory from the earth</b><br>This phrase expresses a desire for the complete eradication of the wicked's legacy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, memory and name were significant, as they were tied to one's honor and existence beyond death. To have one's memory cut off was to face ultimate disgrace and obliteration from history. This reflects the psalmist's wish for the total removal of the wicked's influence and remembrance, akin to the fate of the Amalekites, whose memory God vowed to blot out (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where the unrighteous face eternal separation from God (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>). The phrase underscores the seriousness of divine retribution and the ultimate triumph of God's justice over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and imprecation against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm is directed towards those who have wronged David, possibly including individuals like Saul or other adversaries during his reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure to whom David directs his plea, seeking divine justice and intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David ruled, often facing external and internal threats.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/imprecatory_psalms.htm">Imprecatory Psalms</a></b><br>Psalm 109 is part of a group of psalms known for their calls for divine judgment against enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has lasting consequences, and unrepentant sin can lead to divine judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_imprecatory_prayer.htm">The Role of Imprecatory Prayer</a></b><br>While difficult, these prayers reflect a deep trust in God's justice and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God is just and will remember the sins of the unrepentant, but He is also merciful to those who seek forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_righteous_living.htm">The Importance of Righteous Living</a></b><br>Living righteously ensures that our memory is a blessing rather than a curse.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god_with_our_enemies.htm">Trusting God with Our Enemies</a></b><br>We are called to leave vengeance to God and trust Him to deal with those who wrong us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_109_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 109:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_15_Remember_sin_s_impact.htm">How does Psalm 109:15 emphasize the importance of remembering sin's consequences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_15_on_justice_accountability.htm">What does Psalm 109:15 teach about God's justice and accountability?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_15_Guide_for_righteous_prayer.htm">How can Psalm 109:15 guide us in praying for God's righteous judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_15_vs_Matthew_6_14-15.htm">How does Psalm 109:15 connect with teachings on forgiveness in Matthew 6:14-15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Psalm_109_15_lessons_daily.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Psalm 109:15 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Psalm_109_15.htm">What is the historical context of Psalm 109:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_15_and_forgiveness.htm">How does Psalm 109:15 align with the concept of forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_erase_memory_in_Psalm_109_15.htm">Why does Psalm 109:15 call for the erasure of memory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_109.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 109?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'jesus_is_enough'_truly_mean.htm">Can God witness sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_15_4_clash_with_matthew_5_44.htm">Psalm 15:4 endorses despising the vile while honoring the godly;

By asking, &#8220;May their sins,&#8221; he is highlighting the actual guilt of his enemies, not mere misunderstandings. Scripture elsewhere shows that unconfessed sin piles up before God (<a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>). The plea is not vindictive whim but an appeal for God&#8217;s righteous response to evil, consistent with <a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5-6</a>, where &#8220;the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>always remain</b><p>The request that the sins &#8220;always remain&#8221; underscores permanence. David is essentially saying, &#8220;Let there be no statute of limitations on this wrongdoing.&#8221; Similar language appears in <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>, &#8220;Add iniquity to their iniquity; let them not enter into Your righteousness,&#8221;. Persistent rebellion results in persistent liability (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>). The idea is not to bar repentance but to insist that, until repentance occurs, the record must stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the LORD</b><p>To be &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; is to be in full view of His holy presence. <a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a> states, &#8220;You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence,&#8221;. Nothing is hidden (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). David trusts that God, the perfect Judge, sees all and will weigh every deed (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). This confidence in divine oversight allows believers to leave vengeance with God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He may cut off</b><p>The phrase introduces purpose: God&#8217;s awareness of sin leads to decisive action. &#8220;The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth,&#8221; <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>. Divine &#8220;cutting off&#8221; is covenant language for severe judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>). It reminds us that persistent wickedness invites God&#8217;s active intervention, not merely passive displeasure (<a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their memory from the earth</b><p>The final goal is total erasure of the evildoer&#8217;s legacy. <a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a> observes, &#8220;The name of the wicked will rot,&#8221;. This does not negate final resurrection and judgment (<a href="/john/5-29.htm">John 5:29</a>); rather, it speaks of earthly reputation and influence being wiped away, much like Amalek, whose remembrance God vowed to blot out (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>). <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;May his descendants be cut off; may their name be blotted out in the next generation,&#8221;. Sin ultimately leads to obscurity, while the righteous are remembered forever (<a href="/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/109-15.htm">Psalm 109:15</a> is a sober reminder that unrepented sin remains on heaven&#8217;s docket, fully visible to God. David appeals for justice: let the wrongdoing stay on record until God acts, and let the unrepentant suffer the loss of all earthly legacy. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s judgment is thorough&#8212;He sees, He remembers, and, in His time, He eradicates the influence of persistent evil, vindicating His holiness and defending His faithful ones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be before the Lord continually</span>;
