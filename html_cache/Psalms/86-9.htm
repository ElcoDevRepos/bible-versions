It reflects the biblical teaching that God is the origin of every nation and people group, as seen in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, which details the Table of Nations. This universality underscores the idea that God's authority and creative power extend over the entire earth, not just Israel. Theologically, it points to the inclusivity of God's plan for salvation, which is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>will come and bow before You, O Lord</b><br>This phrase prophesies a future time when all nations will recognize and submit to God's authority. It is reminiscent of <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where it is declared that every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Historically, this reflects the eschatological hope found in the Old Testament, where the nations are envisioned as coming to worship the God of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). Culturally, bowing is a sign of reverence and submission, indicating that all people will ultimately acknowledge God's supremacy.<p><b>and they will glorify Your name</b><br>The glorification of God's name signifies the acknowledgment of His holiness, power, and majesty. In biblical context, God's name represents His character and essence. This phrase aligns with the prophetic vision in <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, where nations are drawn to the light of God's glory. It also connects to the worship scenes in Revelation, where people from every tribe, tongue, and nation praise God (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>). This universal worship fulfills the Abrahamic promise that through his descendants, all nations of the earth will be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), ultimately pointing to the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/86.htm">Psalm 86</a>, David is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as the second king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to all the peoples and ethnic groups of the world.
