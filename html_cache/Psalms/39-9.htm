In the ancient Near Eastern culture, silence could be a form of respect or acknowledgment of a higher authority. The psalmist's decision to be mute may indicate a deep reverence for God's sovereignty and an understanding of human limitations. This silence can also be seen as a response to suffering or divine discipline, aligning with Job's response to his trials (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4-5</a>).<p><b>I do not open my mouth</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the psalmist's resolve to refrain from speaking. In biblical literature, the mouth is often associated with the expression of one's heart and mind. By choosing not to speak, the psalmist demonstrates a surrender to God's will, reminiscent of Jesus' silence before His accusers (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>). This restraint can be seen as an act of faith, trusting that God understands the unspoken concerns and will act justly.<p><b>because of what You have done.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's active role in the psalmist's circumstances. It suggests a recognition of divine intervention, whether in judgment, discipline, or providence. The psalmist attributes his situation to God's actions, which may include both blessings and trials. This acknowledgment is consistent with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all events (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). It also reflects a trust in God's ultimate purpose, paralleling Joseph's understanding of God's hand in his life despite his brothers' betrayal (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>, David is expressing his deep introspection and struggle with the brevity and frailty of life.
