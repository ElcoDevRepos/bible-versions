Singing was a primary means of expressing devotion and reverence to God. The "glory of His name" refers to the recognition of God's divine attributes and His reputation among the nations. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the character and essence of a person. God's name embodies His holiness, power, and majesty. This call to sing is an invitation to acknowledge and proclaim God's greatness. The Psalms frequently encourage singing as a form of worship (e.g., <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95:1-2</a>, <a href="/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100:1-2</a>), and this practice is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p><b>make His praise glorious.</b><br>This phrase calls for worship that is not only sincere but also magnificent and worthy of God's majesty. The term "glorious" suggests a level of excellence and splendor in the act of praise. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, worship was often accompanied by music, dance, and other expressions of joy and reverence (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>). The idea is to offer God the best of our worship, reflecting His glory in our praise. This aligns with the biblical principle of giving God the first and best of what we have (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate expression of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>) and through whom believers offer spiritual sacrifices of praise (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/66.htm">Psalm 66</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who calls the congregation to worship and praise God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure of the Psalm, whose glory and deeds are the focus of the praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often addressed in the Psalms, representing God's chosen people who are called to worship Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context in which many Psalms were sung, highlighting the communal aspect of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>Implicit in the call to praise, as all creation is seen as reflecting God's glory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_praise.htm">The Power of Praise</a></b><br>Praise is not just an expression of gratitude but a powerful declaration of God's attributes and deeds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_his_name.htm">The Glory of His Name</a></b><br>God's name represents His character and reputation.
