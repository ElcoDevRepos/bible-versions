In the biblical context, the opening of jaws symbolizes a threat or impending attack. This imagery is often used in the Psalms to describe enemies who are ready to devour or destroy (<a href="/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a>). The metaphor of jaws being opened suggests a readiness to consume, reflecting the psalmist's feeling of vulnerability and danger. Historically, this can be seen as a representation of the psalmist's adversaries, who are numerous and powerful, much like a pack of predators. This phrase also foreshadows the suffering of Jesus Christ, who faced hostility and aggression from those who opposed Him (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>).<p><b>like lions that roar and maul</b><br>Lions are frequently used in Scripture to symbolize strength, ferocity, and danger (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). In the ancient Near East, lions were known for their power and were often feared by people. The roaring of a lion is a sign of its dominance and intent to attack, while mauling indicates the physical harm and destruction it can cause. This imagery underscores the intensity of the threat faced by the psalmist. In a prophetic sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, where He was surrounded by those who sought to harm Him, much like a lion's prey (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The use of such vivid imagery serves to highlight the depth of distress and the need for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of anguish and persecution, often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of Christ's suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The "they" in this verse refers to David's adversaries, who are depicted as fierce and threatening, similar to lions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Symbolic of powerful and dangerous foes, lions in this context represent the overwhelming and aggressive nature of David's enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_prophecy.htm">Messianic Prophecy</a></b><br>This psalm is often viewed as a prophetic reference to the suffering of Jesus Christ, particularly His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion_of_jesus.htm">Crucifixion of Jesus</a></b><br>The events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion are seen as a fulfillment of the imagery and suffering described in <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_persecution.htm">Understanding Persecution</a></b><br>Recognize that believers may face fierce opposition, much like David and ultimately Jesus did.

<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>), fulfilling this verse with striking precision.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores more than words; it conveys a readiness to devour, revealing the heart-level aggression of sin&#8217;s enemies toward God&#8217;s anointed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like lions</b><p>The comparison shifts the focus to sheer predator ferocity.<p>&#8226; Lions symbolize lethal power throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul felt similar danger when &#8220;I was delivered from the lion&#8217;s mouth&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter warns believers that the devil &#8220;prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), linking David&#8217;s experience&#8212;and Christ&#8217;s&#8212;to a wider spiritual battlefield.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That roar</b><p>The roar signals domination and terror.<p>&#8226;

Roaring also mimics Satan&#8217;s tactics: loud intimidation meant to shake trust, yet &#8220;The LORD roars from Zion&#8221; in ultimate authority (<a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>), assuring the faithful that God&#8217;s voice overrides every enemy roar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And maul</b><p>Mauling depicts tearing flesh&#8212;violence fully unleashed.<p>&#8226;

The verse reassures believers that every hostile mouth, roar, and wound was foreseen, folded into God&#8217;s saving plan, and finally silenced by the Lion of Judah who rose victorious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Ravening.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">tearing in pieces. </span>(Comp. <a href="/context/lamentations/2-15.htm" title="All that pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-10.htm" title="He was to me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.">Lamentations 3:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Roaring.</span>--Comp. <a href="/amos/3-4.htm" title="Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?">Amos 3:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They gaped upon me with their</span> <span class="cmt_word">mouths.</span> One metaphor is superseded by another.
