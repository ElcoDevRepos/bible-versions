In the context of ancient Israel, enemies often used surprise attacks as a military strategy. The psalmist's request for ruin to come unexpectedly upon his foes mirrors the sudden and unforeseen nature of such attacks. This aligns with the biblical principle of retributive justice, where the wicked face consequences for their actions. The element of surprise underscores the sovereignty of God, who can bring about justice in ways beyond human anticipation. This theme is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>, where calamity comes suddenly upon the wicked.<p><b>may the net they hid ensnare them;</b><br>The imagery of a net is common in biblical literature, symbolizing traps set by the wicked to capture the innocent. In ancient times, nets were used for hunting and fishing, representing a method of entrapment. The psalmist's prayer for the enemies to be caught in their own net reflects the concept of poetic justice, where evildoers fall victim to their schemes. This idea is paralleled in <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, which states that those who dig a pit will fall into it. The net also serves as a metaphor for the deceit and cunning of the wicked, contrasting with the righteousness and protection of God.<p><b>may they fall into the hazard they created.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the principle of sowing and reaping, where individuals face the consequences of their actions. The "hazard" refers to the dangers and traps set by the enemies, which they intended for others. The psalmist's desire for the wicked to fall into their own hazard highlights the justice of God, who ensures that evil plans backfire. This concept is seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>, where Haman is hanged on the gallows he prepared for Mordecai. The phrase also points to the ultimate triumph of righteousness over wickedness, a recurring theme in the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is seeking God's intervention against his enemies.

The plea rests on the conviction that God&#8217;s justice is never late, even when it bursts in unexpectedly. Scripture repeatedly shows this pattern: &#8226; When Pharaoh&#8217;s army raced into the Red Sea, &#8220;the LORD overthrew the Egyptians&#8221; without warning (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>). &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a> teaches that calamity &#8220;will come suddenly; instantly he will be broken.&#8221; &#8226; Paul echoes the same principle, noting that &#8220;destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). David&#8217;s words are not a personal vendetta but a call for God to uphold His righteous order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may the net they hid ensnare them</b><p>Here David asks that the very traps set for him become the instruments of the attackers&#8217; downfall. Scripture loves this theme of poetic justice: &#8220;He dug a pit and hollowed it out; but he has fallen into the hole he made&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15&#8211;16</a>), and later, &#8220;They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit ahead of me, but they themselves have fallen into it&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>). Similar warnings surface in <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>. The lesson is clear: plotting harm against God&#8217;s people ultimately rebounds on the plotter, because the Lord oversees every cause-and-effect in His moral universe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may they fall into the hazard they created</b><p>The concluding plea intensifies the previous one: not only should the enemy&#8217;s trap spring shut, but it should become their very downfall. Haman died on the gallows he built for Mordecai (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>). Those who threw Daniel into the lions&#8217; den were later thrown in themselves (<a href="/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a> sums up the principle: &#8220;The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.&#8221; David&#8217;s request therefore aligns with God&#8217;s consistent pattern&#8212;He allows evil schemes to implode, displaying both His fairness and His sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a> is a confident appeal for divine justice: sudden judgment, poetic reversal, and fitting retribution. Far from personal vengeance, it rests on the assurance that God faithfully defends His people and turns every malicious plot back on the plotter. The verse invites believers to trust the Lord&#8217;s timing, refuse personal retaliation, and remain certain that righteousness will ultimately prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Let destruction.</span>--There is considerable difficulty here, and the ancient versions, by their variations, seem to point to some confusion in the text.
