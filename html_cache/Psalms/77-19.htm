It highlights God's direct intervention in history, guiding His people through seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The sea, often symbolizing chaos and danger in ancient Near Eastern literature, becomes a pathway under God's command. This event is a foundational moment in Israel's history, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness. It also prefigures the baptism of believers, symbolizing a passage from slavery to freedom.<p><b>Your way through the mighty waters</b><br>The "mighty waters" emphasize the overwhelming nature of the Red Sea, which God controls with ease. This imagery is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>, where God makes a way through the sea. The waters represent both physical and spiritual challenges that God can overcome. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus calms the stormy sea in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, showcasing His divine authority over nature.<p><b>but Your footprints were not to be found</b><br>This phrase suggests the mysterious and unseen nature of God's work. While His actions are evident, His presence is not always visible. This can be linked to the concept of faith, as described in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, where believers trust in what they cannot see. The absence of footprints signifies God's transcendence and the idea that His ways are higher than human understanding, as stated in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>. This also points to the incarnation of Christ, who walked among humanity yet often went unrecognized for who He truly was, as seen in <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing divine guidance and sovereignty over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Symbolic of chaos and obstacles, often representing the Red Sea in the context of Israel's exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_waters.htm">Mighty Waters</a></b><br>A metaphor for overwhelming challenges or trials that God leads His people through.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/footprints.htm">Footprints</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's unseen presence and guidance, emphasizing His mysterious and transcendent nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus_event.htm">Exodus Event</a></b><br>The historical backdrop of this verse, where God led the Israelites through the Red Sea, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_chaos.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Chaos</a></b><br>Just as God led Israel through the Red Sea, He is sovereign over the chaos in our lives.

The psalmist recalls the literal parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;22</a>), underscoring that God charts real, physical routes where no human road exists.<p>&#8226; The verse looks back to that historical moment when &#8220;He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the waters on foot&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God is never confined to natural limitations. Just as He &#8220;divided the sea before them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>), He still forges paths through the impossible.<p>&#8226; For believers, the line invites confidence: if the Lord once cut a highway through a wall of water, He can certainly guide us through today&#8217;s crises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your way through the mighty waters</b><p>The psalmist continues, &#8220;Your way through the mighty waters&#8221;, stressing both the danger of the situation and the supremacy of God over it.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Mighty waters&#8221; picture chaos and overwhelming power, yet &#8220;The LORD is mightier than the breakers of the sea&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah echoes the image: &#8220;This is what the LORD says&#8212;He who makes a way in the sea and a path through the surging waters&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>).<p>&#8226; When swirling circumstances feel deeper than we can handle, we remember that &#8220;He rebukes the sea and dries it up&#8221; (<a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The same God who shepherded Israel between towering waves stands sovereign over every modern torrent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Your footprints were not to be found</b><p>The sentence concludes, &#8220;but Your footprints were not to be found&#8221;.

We know not; we need not know. The obscuring, the mystery, here as elsewhere, was part of the lesson. . . . All that we see distinctly is, that through this dark and terrible night, with the enemy pressing close behind, and the driving sea on either side, He led His people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>i. 128).<p>To some minds the abruptness of the conclusion of the psalm marks it as unfinished. But no better end could have been reached in the poet's perplexity than that to which he has been led by his musings on the past, the thought of the religious aids ready to his hand, in the faith and worship left by Moses and Aaron. We are reminded of him who recalled the thoughts of the young man, searching for a higher ideal of duty, back to the law and obedience. Or if the psalm is rather an expression of the feeling of the community than of an individual, there is a pointed significance in the conclusion given to all the national cries of doubt and despair--the one safe course was to remain loyal and true to the ancient institutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/77.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy way is in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sea;</span> rather, <span class="accented">was in the sea.</span> Thou wentest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in person before thy people in their passage across the dry bed of the Red Sea; truly there, though invisible (comp. <a href="/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52, 53</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy path in the great waters;</span> literally, <span class="accented">thy paths.</span> So the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And thy footsteps are not known;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were not</span>.
