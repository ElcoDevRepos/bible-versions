In biblical literature, the sea often represents danger and the unknown, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, bringing order from chaos. The roaring and foaming waters can also be seen as a metaphor for nations in turmoil, as in <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>, where the nations are compared to the roaring of mighty waters. This imagery underscores God's sovereignty over creation and the nations, emphasizing His power to bring peace amidst chaos.<p><b>and the mountains quake in the surge</b><br>Mountains in biblical times were often seen as symbols of stability and permanence. The quaking of mountains signifies a dramatic upheaval, suggesting that even the most stable elements of creation are subject to God's power. This can be connected to the theophany at Mount Sinai in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where the mountain trembles at God's presence. The imagery of quaking mountains also points to eschatological themes, as seen in <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>, where mountains are moved from their places during the end times. This serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over all creation.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is a Hebrew word found frequently in the Psalms, often interpreted as a pause for reflection or a musical interlude. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but it invites the reader or listener to pause and consider the weight of the preceding words. In the context of this verse, "Selah" encourages contemplation of God's power over natural and national chaos, prompting trust in His unchanging nature amidst life's uncertainties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46</a>, traditionally attributed to the sons of Korah, who were Levites and temple musicians.
