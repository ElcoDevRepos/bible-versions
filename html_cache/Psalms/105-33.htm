Vines and fig trees were significant agricultural products in ancient Egypt, symbolizing prosperity and sustenance. The destruction of these plants would have been a severe blow to the Egyptian economy and daily life. In biblical symbolism, the vine often represents Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), and the fig tree can symbolize peace and security (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). The striking of these plants in Egypt underscores God's power over nature and His ability to disrupt the natural order to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and shattered the trees of their country</b><br>The shattering of trees indicates a comprehensive devastation affecting the entire land. Trees in the ancient Near East were vital for food, shade, and construction. This destruction would have had long-term effects on the environment and the people&#8217;s livelihood. The phrase echoes the broader theme of divine judgment found throughout the Old Testament, where God uses natural elements to execute His will (<a href="/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>). This act can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate judgment and restoration that will come through Jesus Christ, who is described as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>) and the one who brings peace and restoration to creation (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, acting in judgment against Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation experiencing God's judgment through the plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vines_and_fig_trees.htm">Vines and Fig Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity and sustenance in the ancient Near East.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trees_of_their_country.htm">Trees of Their Country</a></b><br>Represents the broader agricultural devastation affecting Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues_of_egypt.htm">Plagues of Egypt</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments against Egypt, of which this verse is a part.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God has the power to bring about judgment on nations, demonstrating His control over creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_prosperity.htm">Symbolism of Prosperity</a></b><br>Vines and fig trees symbolize prosperity and sustenance.
