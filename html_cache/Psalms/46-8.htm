Throughout the Bible, God's works are often displayed as evidence of His power and sovereignty. In the context of <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46</a>, the psalmist calls the audience to observe God's intervention in human history, particularly His deliverance of Israel from its enemies. This echoes the call in <a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18-19</a>, where God&#8217;s works are a testament to His glory among the nations. The invitation to "come, see" suggests an experiential understanding, urging believers to recognize and reflect on God's active presence in the world.<p><b>who brings devastation upon the earth</b><br>This phrase highlights God's authority over creation and His ability to bring judgment. The term "devastation" can be understood as God's righteous judgment against sin and rebellion, as seen in events like the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a> or the plagues of Egypt in <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>. It underscores the theme of divine justice, where God acts to uphold His holiness and righteousness. This also points to eschatological themes found in Revelation, where God will ultimately judge the earth. The devastation serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human power and the enduring sovereignty of God. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over evil, a theme fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who will return to establish His kingdom in full.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Represents the entirety of creation, which is under God's control and subject to His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works_of_the_lord.htm">The Works of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the mighty acts and judgments of God, which demonstrate His power and authority over the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/devastation.htm">Devastation</a></b><br>This term highlights God's ability to bring about change, often through judgment, to fulfill His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events on earth, including those that seem devastating.
