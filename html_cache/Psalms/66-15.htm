Fatlings, or well-fed animals, were considered the best of the flock, symbolizing the offerer's dedication and willingness to give God the finest. This practice is rooted in Levitical law, where offerings were meant to be without blemish (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). The act of offering fatlings signifies a heart of gratitude and reverence, acknowledging God's provision and sovereignty.<p><b>with the fragrant smoke of rams</b><br>The fragrant smoke represents the pleasing aroma to the Lord, as described in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>. Rams were often used in significant sacrifices, such as the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18</a>). The smoke ascending to heaven symbolizes prayers and offerings reaching God, indicating acceptance and divine favor. This imagery also foreshadows Christ's sacrifice, which is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>I will offer bulls and goats</b><br>Bulls and goats were common sacrificial animals, each with specific roles in the sacrificial system. Bulls were often used for sin offerings, especially for the atonement of the priesthood and the congregation (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-14</a>). Goats were used in the Day of Atonement rituals, symbolizing the removal of sin (<a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7-10</a>). This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the psalmist's devotion, offering a variety of sacrifices to cover all aspects of worship and atonement.<p><b>Selah</b><br>Selah is a term used frequently in the Psalms, often interpreted as a pause for reflection or musical interlude. It invites the reader or listener to contemplate the significance of the preceding verses. In this context, it encourages meditation on the depth of commitment and the spiritual implications of the sacrifices offered, prompting a deeper understanding of worship and devotion to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to David, who expresses a commitment to worship God through sacrifices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of the offerings, representing the divine presence and authority in the life of the believer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament where the entire animal was consumed by fire, symbolizing complete devotion to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rams,_bulls,_and_goats.htm">Rams, Bulls, and Goats</a></b><br>Animals used in sacrificial offerings, each with specific significance in the Hebrew sacrificial system.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifice.htm">Understanding Sacrifice</a></b><br>The psalmist's mention of burnt offerings highlights the importance of sacrifice in worship.
