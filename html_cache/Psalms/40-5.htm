The wonders include creation, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, and the provision in the wilderness. These acts demonstrate God's power and faithfulness. The use of "O LORD my God" signifies a personal relationship with God, emphasizing His covenantal name, Yahweh, which is often associated with His acts of salvation and mercy.<p><b>and the plans You have for us&#8212;</b><br>This reflects the belief in God's sovereign will and purpose for His people. The plans refer to God's intentions and purposes, which are often seen as benevolent and for the ultimate good of His followers. <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a> echoes this sentiment, where God speaks of having plans for welfare and not for evil. This assurance of divine planning is a source of comfort and hope, suggesting that God is actively involved in the lives of His people.<p><b>none can compare to You&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the uniqueness and incomparability of God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, where polytheism was prevalent, this statement affirms monotheism and the supremacy of the God of Israel over all other deities. <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-25</a> similarly emphasizes that no one and nothing can be likened to God, underscoring His unmatched greatness and holiness.<p><b>if I proclaim and declare them,</b><br>The act of proclaiming and declaring suggests a public testimony of God's deeds. This is an important aspect of worship and witness in the biblical tradition, where recounting God's works serves to glorify Him and encourage others. The psalmist's intent to speak of God's wonders aligns with the call in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> to teach and talk about God's commandments and deeds.<p><b>they are more than I can count.</b><br>This phrase conveys the overwhelming abundance of God's works and plans. It suggests that God's actions are beyond human comprehension and enumeration, reflecting His infinite nature. The sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17-18</a>, where the psalmist marvels at the vastness of God's thoughts.
