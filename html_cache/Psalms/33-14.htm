In biblical context, God's dwelling place is not limited to a physical location but represents His omnipresence and sovereignty over creation. The concept of God's dwelling is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where heaven is described as His throne. This emphasizes God's transcendence and authority over the universe.<p><b>He gazes</b><br>The act of gazing implies a continuous and attentive observation. This suggests God's intimate involvement with His creation, highlighting His omniscience. In <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>, it is stated that the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth, reinforcing the idea that God is actively watching over His people. This also reflects His role as a righteous judge who sees all actions and intentions.<p><b>on all who inhabit the earth</b><br>This phrase underscores the universality of God's watchfulness. It includes every person, regardless of nationality or status, indicating that no one is beyond His sight. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God's impartiality, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>, where God shows no favoritism but accepts those who fear Him and do what is right. It also serves as a reminder of human accountability before God, who sees and knows all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the omniscient observer of humanity from His heavenly dwelling.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, symbolizing His divine authority and perspective over the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_earth.htm">Inhabitants of the Earth</a></b><br>All people living on earth, who are under the watchful gaze of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God sees everything from His heavenly perspective.
