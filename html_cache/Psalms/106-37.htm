The Israelites were explicitly forbidden from engaging in such practices (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). This act was a severe violation of God's commandments and demonstrated a profound departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The sacrifice of children was seen as the ultimate act of idolatry and rebellion against God, highlighting the depth of Israel's apostasy during certain periods of their history, such as during the reigns of kings like Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>).<p><b>to demons</b><br>The term "demons" here is significant as it underscores the spiritual reality behind idolatry. In the biblical worldview, idols are not merely lifeless objects but are associated with demonic forces (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>). This connection emphasizes the spiritual warfare aspect of idolatry, where turning away from God to worship idols is tantamount to aligning with demonic powers. The use of "demons" also reflects the understanding that these false gods were not benign but malevolent, seeking to draw people away from the true God. This phrase serves as a stark reminder of the spiritual consequences of idolatry and the reality of evil forces at work in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt but often fell into idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where they encountered pagan nations and their practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual entities opposed to God, often associated with pagan worship and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding cultures in Canaan that practiced child sacrifice and other abominations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/child_sacrifice.htm">Child Sacrifice</a></b><br>A horrific practice adopted by the Israelites from the Canaanites, condemned by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>Mixing true worship with pagan practices leads to spiritual corruption.
