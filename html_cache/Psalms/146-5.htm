In the Hebrew tradition, being blessed is associated with living in accordance with God's will and receiving His protection and provision. This echoes the Beatitudes in the New Testament, where Jesus describes the blessed as those who embody certain spiritual qualities (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>).<p><b>whose help is the God of Jacob</b><br>The "God of Jacob" refers to the God of the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;emphasizing God's covenantal faithfulness. Jacob, later named Israel, is a central figure in the history of the Israelites, and his life is marked by divine encounters and promises. This phrase underscores the reliability and historical faithfulness of God, who has been a source of help and deliverance throughout Israel's history. It also connects to the idea of God as a personal helper, as seen in Jacob's own life experiences (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>).<p><b>whose hope is in the LORD his God</b><br>Hope in the LORD signifies trust and expectation in God's promises and character. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This hope is not just wishful thinking but a confident assurance based on God's past faithfulness and future promises. The concept of hope is central to the biblical narrative, as seen in the prophets who spoke of a future restoration and in the New Testament, where hope is fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_jacob.htm">God of Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the God worshiped by Jacob, one of the patriarchs of Israel.
