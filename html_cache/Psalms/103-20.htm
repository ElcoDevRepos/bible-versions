Angels are spiritual beings created by God, often depicted as messengers or servants who execute His will. In biblical context, angels are seen as powerful and numerous, as described in passages like <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>. Their primary role is to serve God and minister to His people, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>. The call for angels to bless the Lord emphasizes their role in the divine order and their acknowledgment of God's supreme authority.<p><b>mighty in strength</b><br>Angels are described as possessing great power and might, which is evident in various biblical accounts. For instance, in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, a single angel is said to have struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. This phrase underscores the formidable nature of angels, highlighting their ability to carry out God's commands with strength and authority. Their might is not for their own purposes but is directed towards fulfilling God's will.<p><b>who carry out His word</b><br>Angels are depicted as obedient servants who execute God's commands. This obedience is a key aspect of their nature, as seen in the story of Gabriel delivering messages to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a>) and to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). Their role in carrying out God's word reflects their dedication to His purposes and their integral part in the unfolding of His divine plan. This obedience also serves as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will.<p><b>who hearken to the voice of His command</b><br>The phrase highlights the attentiveness and readiness of angels to respond to God's directives. This responsiveness is seen in various biblical narratives, such as the angels who ministered to Jesus after His temptation (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>) and those who will accompany Him at His return (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>). The angels' willingness to listen and act upon God's command illustrates their role as faithful servants, always prepared to fulfill His purposes. This serves as a reminder of the importance of listening to God's voice and being ready to act in accordance with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, described here as mighty in strength and obedient to God's commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (implied)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>, traditionally understood to be King David, who often wrote about God's majesty and the role of angels.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_angels.htm">The Power of Angels</a></b><br>Angels are described as "mighty in strength," indicating their significant power and ability to carry out God's will.
