In biblical context, "thoughts" can refer to God's plans, purposes, and intentions. The Hebrew word for "precious" suggests something rare and valuable, akin to jewels or treasures. This reflects the psalmist's deep appreciation for God's wisdom and understanding. The phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human thoughts and ways. It also connects to the idea of God's omniscience, as seen earlier in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, where God's intimate knowledge of the psalmist is detailed. The reverence for God's thoughts can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<p><b>how vast is their sum!</b><br>The vastness of God's thoughts indicates their infinite nature, suggesting that they are beyond human comprehension. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's omnipotence and omniscience, as seen in <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a>, where God's mysteries are described as higher than the heavens and deeper than the depths. The psalmist's awe at the magnitude of God's thoughts reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty and the complexity of His creation and plans. This vastness can also be seen in the context of God's covenantal promises, which are numerous and encompass all of history, pointing to the fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies the culmination of God's redemptive plan. The phrase invites believers to trust in God's comprehensive understanding and perfect will, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, King David, is expressing his awe and reverence for God's omniscience and intimate knowledge of him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The central figure in this verse, whose thoughts and knowledge are described as precious and vast.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of the Psalms often reflects the relationship between God and His chosen people, Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_god's_thoughts.htm">The Value of God's Thoughts</a></b><br>God's thoughts towards us are not only numerous but also precious.
