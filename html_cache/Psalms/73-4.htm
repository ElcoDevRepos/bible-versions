In biblical context, this can be seen as a lament over the prosperity of the wicked, a common theme in wisdom literature such as Job and Ecclesiastes. The psalmist is perplexed by the lack of suffering in the death of those who live unrighteously, contrasting with the struggles often faced by the righteous. This observation challenges the retributive justice principle, where good is rewarded and evil is punished, a theme also explored in <a href="/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/12.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>. Theologically, it raises questions about divine justice and the prosperity of the wicked, which are addressed later in the psalm.<p><b>their bodies are well-fed.</b><br>This phrase suggests that the wicked enjoy physical prosperity and health, which is often seen as a sign of divine blessing in the Old Testament. The imagery of being "well-fed" indicates abundance and a life of ease, contrasting with the struggles of the righteous who may suffer despite their faithfulness. This prosperity can be linked to the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, where wealth and health were often viewed as indicators of favor from the gods. The psalmist's observation is a critique of this worldview, highlighting the temporary nature of such prosperity. In a broader biblical context, this can be connected to the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>, where earthly wealth does not equate to eternal security. The phrase challenges readers to consider the true source of blessing and the ultimate justice of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
