The psalmist reflects on the oral traditions and teachings about God's mighty acts and now witnesses them firsthand. This mirrors the biblical principle that faith comes by hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>) and is confirmed by experience. It underscores the continuity of God's faithfulness across generations, as seen in the history of Israel.<p><b>in the city of the LORD of Hosts,</b><br>The "city of the LORD of Hosts" refers to Jerusalem, a central place of worship and the dwelling place of God among His people. The term "LORD of Hosts" highlights God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, emphasizing His power and protection. Jerusalem is often depicted as a symbol of God's presence and His covenant with Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/31-5.htm">Isaiah 31:5</a>.<p><b>in the city of our God:</b><br>This phrase reiterates the special status of Jerusalem as not just a political capital but a spiritual center. It is "our God," indicating a personal relationship between God and His people. The city is a tangible representation of God's kingdom on earth, foreshadowing the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where God's presence will dwell eternally with His people.<p><b>God will establish her forever.</b><br>This promise of eternal establishment points to the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people. Historically, Jerusalem has faced destruction and rebuilding, yet the promise of eternal establishment is ultimately fulfilled in the eschatological vision of a new heaven and new earth. This assurance is echoed in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> and <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>, where Jerusalem is depicted as a center of peace and divine rule.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often interpreted as a pause for reflection or a musical interlude. It invites the reader or listener to meditate on the profound truths just expressed. In this context, it serves as a moment to contemplate the faithfulness of God, the significance of Jerusalem, and the assurance of His eternal promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_the_lord_of_hosts.htm">City of the LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This refers to Jerusalem, often seen as the spiritual and political center of Israel, representing God's presence and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_our_god.htm">City of our God</a></b><br>Another reference to Jerusalem, emphasizing its divine significance and the special relationship between God and His chosen city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_of_hosts.htm">LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God that highlights His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_establishment.htm">God's Establishment</a></b><br>The act of God securing and sustaining Jerusalem, symbolizing His eternal covenant and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude, inviting the reader to meditate on the preceding message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Just as God established Jerusalem, He is faithful to establish His promises in our lives.
