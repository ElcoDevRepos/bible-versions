In the Old Testament, God is often portrayed as a defender of the marginalized, such as widows, orphans, and foreigners (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>). The prophets frequently called Israel to uphold justice, reflecting God's character (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus embodies this divine justice, advocating for the oppressed and challenging societal norms (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>). The phrase underscores God's active role in righting wrongs and His concern for those who suffer injustice.<p><b>and gives food to the hungry.</b><br>Providing for the hungry is a tangible expression of God's care and provision. In the wilderness, God provided manna for the Israelites (Exodus 16), demonstrating His ability to meet physical needs. Jesus, in the New Testament, fed the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), symbolizing God's abundant provision and foreshadowing the spiritual nourishment He offers. This phrase also calls believers to emulate God's generosity, as seen in the early church's practice of sharing resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>The LORD sets the prisoners free,</b><br>This phrase can be understood both literally and metaphorically. In the historical context, God delivered Israel from bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>) and later from Babylonian captivity (<a href="/isaiah/49-9.htm">Isaiah 49:9</a>). Spiritually, it points to liberation from sin and death through Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>). Jesus' ministry included freeing those bound by spiritual oppression (<a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a>). This liberation is a key aspect of the gospel message, offering hope and freedom to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Individuals who are suffering under injustice or hardship.
