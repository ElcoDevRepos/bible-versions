The "beast" could symbolize the power and pride of Egypt, a nation historically opposed to Israel. The call for rebuke suggests a divine intervention against oppressive forces. In a broader sense, it represents God's authority over all nations and powers, aligning with themes found in <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>.<p><b>The herd of bulls among the calves of the nations</b><br>The "herd of bulls" may symbolize powerful leaders or nations, with "calves" representing smaller or less powerful nations. Bulls are often used in scripture to denote strength and dominance. This imagery suggests a hierarchy among nations, with God having the ultimate authority to humble even the mightiest. This can be connected to the imagery in <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, where strong bulls are a metaphor for formidable adversaries.<p><b>Until it submits, bringing bars of silver</b><br>The submission implies a humbling or subjugation of these powerful entities before God. "Bringing bars of silver" suggests tribute or offerings, indicating acknowledgment of God's supremacy. Historically, silver was a common form of tribute or currency, and this phrase may reflect the practice of conquered nations bringing wealth to their conquerors. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eschatological vision in <a href="/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>, where nations bring wealth to honor God.<p><b>Scatter the nations who delight in war</b><br>This phrase calls for the dispersion of warlike nations, emphasizing God's desire for peace and justice. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a warrior who fights for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. The scattering of nations is a recurring motif, symbolizing divine judgment and the futility of opposing God's will. This aligns with the prophetic vision in <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, where nations will no longer learn war, highlighting the ultimate peace brought by God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast_in_the_reeds.htm">The Beast in the Reeds</a></b><br>This phrase likely refers to a powerful, oppressive force or nation, possibly Egypt, as reeds are often associated with the Nile River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_herd_of_bulls.htm">The Herd of Bulls</a></b><br>Symbolic of strong leaders or nations, possibly representing those who oppose God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/calves_of_the_nations.htm">Calves of the Nations</a></b><br>This could symbolize smaller nations or groups that are influenced by more powerful entities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bars_of_silver.htm">Bars of Silver</a></b><br>Represents wealth or tribute that is brought as a sign of submission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_who_delight_in_war.htm">Nations Who Delight in War</a></b><br>Refers to those nations or groups that thrive on conflict and aggression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God has the power to rebuke and humble even the mightiest of nations.

But a slight emendation suggested by Gratz gives <span class= "ital">the herd of bulls despisers of the people, </span>a reading quite in keeping with the ordinary use of this figure.

The figure in connection with the <span class= "ital">bull-worship </span>of Egypt is especially significant.<p><span class= "bld">Till every one submit.</span>--This clause still waits for a satisfactory explanation. The Authorised Version is intelligible, but grammatically indefensible. The LXX. are undoubtedly right in taking the verb as a contracted infinitive preceded by a negative particle (comp. <a href="/genesis/27-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.">Genesis 27:1</a>), and not as a participle. The meaning <span class= "ital">submit </span>or <span class= "ital">humble </span>(<a href="/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>) is only with violence deduced from the original meaning of the verb, which (see <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.">Daniel 7:7</a>) means to <span class= "ital">stamp </span>like a furious animal. One cognate is used (<a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18</a>) of a herd of bulls fouling the pasture with their feet, and another means to <span class= "ital">tread. </span>The form of the verb here used might mean <span class= "ital">to set oneself in quick motion, </span>which is the sense adopted by the LXX. in <a href="/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>. Hence we get <span class= "ital">rebuke </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">from marching for pieces of silver, </span>the meaning being that a rebuke is administered not only to Egypt, but also to those Jews who took the pay of Egypt as mercenaries, and oppressed the rest of the community, a sense in keeping with the next clause. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke the company of spear men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the wild beast of the reeds</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the crocodile or the hippopotamus, either of which may well symbolize the empire of Egypt, the mightiest of the heathen powers in David's time. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the bulls</span> represents other heathen powers, Assyria perhaps especially, which had the human-headed and winged bull for its principal emblem. <span class="cmt_word">With the calves of the people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span> - an obscure phrase, perhaps meaning inferior powers.

This is given as the result of the rebukes.
