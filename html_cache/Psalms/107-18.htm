In biblical times, food was not only a necessity for survival but also a symbol of God's provision and blessing. The loathing of food indicates a severe state of affliction or illness, possibly a result of sin or rebellion against God. This mirrors the Israelites' experiences in the wilderness when they complained about the manna (<a href="/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a>). It also symbolizes a spiritual condition where one rejects the sustenance that God provides, akin to rejecting His Word, which is often likened to food (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p><b>and drew near to the gates of death.</b><br>The imagery of "the gates of death" suggests a proximity to dying, emphasizing the severity of their condition. In ancient Near Eastern culture, gates were significant as places of decision and transition. The "gates of death" metaphorically represent the threshold between life and the afterlife. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>, where God questions Job about his understanding of death's domain. It also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who conquers death and offers eternal life (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). The passage highlights human vulnerability and the need for divine intervention, pointing to the hope of salvation through God's mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>This Psalm is traditionally attributed to the Israelites, reflecting on their experiences and God's deliverance throughout history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> often reflects the Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness, where they faced hunger and despair.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gates_of_death.htm">The Gates of Death</a></b><br>A metaphorical place representing the brink of death or extreme peril, often used in Hebrew poetry to describe a dire situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_provision.htm">Recognizing God's Provision</a></b><br>Even in times of scarcity or dissatisfaction, we must recognize and be grateful for God's provision, trusting that He knows our needs better than we do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_discontent.htm">The Danger of Discontent</a></b><br>Discontentment can lead us away from God and into spiritual peril.

This is not poetic exaggeration; Scripture presents a literal physical response to deep spiritual and moral failure (<a href="/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Job echoes the same reality: &#8220;his soul loathes the choicest meals&#8221; (<a href="/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19-20</a>). When rebellion meets God&#8217;s corrective hand, appetite can vanish.<p>&#8226; Israel experienced this in the wilderness: &#8220;we detest this wretched food!&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a>). Sin changed manna&#8212;God&#8217;s provision&#8212;into something repulsive.<p>&#8226; The psalmist shows that unchecked sin can touch every part of life:<p>&#8211; Body: strength fades, hunger leaves (<a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Mind: joy is replaced with dread.<p>&#8211; Spirit: fellowship with God feels distant until repentance comes (<a href="/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: when a believer notices a growing distaste for the &#8220;daily bread&#8221; of God&#8217;s Word or even physical nourishment, it is wise to examine the heart and return quickly to the Lord (<a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drew near to the gates of death</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Gates&#8221; in Scripture mark an entry point. Here they represent the brink between life and the grave (<a href="/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>). The sufferers are literally close to dying.<p>&#8226; The progression is clear:<p>&#8211; Sin leads to affliction (<a href="/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Affliction left unresolved leads to physical collapse (v. 18a).<p>&#8211; Collapse, if unchecked, ends in death (v. 18b).<p>&#8226; Other voices in Scripture confirm this sequence:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>: &#8220;lift me up from the gates of death.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>: &#8220;I... must go through the gates of Sheol.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5-6</a>: Jonah feels the bars of the realm of the dead closing around him before God intervenes.<p>&#8226; Yet death&#8217;s gates are not final for those who call on the Lord. The very next verses in the psalm announce deliverance: &#8220;Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-19.htm">Psalm 107:19</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament fulfillment: Jesus declares, &#8220;I hold the keys of Death and Hades&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>), guaranteeing that those who trust Him need not fear the gates of death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a> paints a sober picture of sin&#8217;s trajectory: rebellion produces misery so intense that life&#8217;s necessities lose their appeal and the grave looms close. The verse stands as a loving warning and an invitation. When chastening exposes our need, God waits to heal, restore appetite for His goodness, and pull us back from the very threshold of death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/107.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Soul.</span>--The Hebrew word for <span class= "ital">soul </span>is very commonly used for <span class= "ital">strong appetite </span>(see <a href="/psalms/107-9.htm" title="For he satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness.">Psalm 107:9</a>), so that we might paraphrase," their appetite is turned to loathing."
