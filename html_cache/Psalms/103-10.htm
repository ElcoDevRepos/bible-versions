In the Old Testament, the law required justice and punishment for sins (Deuteronomy 28), yet God often showed mercy, as seen in His dealings with Israel. The sacrificial system was a temporary measure pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the punishment for sin (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). This reflects God's character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." The concept of not dealing with us according to our sins is foundational to the gospel message, emphasizing that salvation is a gift of grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>or repaid us according to our iniquities</b><br>Iniquities refer to moral perversity or the inherent sinfulness of humanity. The Bible consistently teaches that the wages of sin is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), yet God, in His mercy, does not repay us as we deserve. This is evident in the story of King David, who, despite his grave sins, received forgiveness and continued to be used by God (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this mercy is found in Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the iniquities of us all (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of divine forgiveness and the new covenant promise that God will remember our sins no more (<a href="/hebrews/8-12.htm">Hebrews 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>, King David is expressing gratitude and praise for God's mercy and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is portrayed as merciful and gracious, not treating humanity as their sins deserve.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the nation of Israel often serves as the backdrop for David's psalms, reflecting on God's covenant relationship with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_and_iniquity.htm">Sin and Iniquity</a></b><br>These terms refer to the moral failings and transgressions of humanity, which God chooses not to repay in kind.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mercy_and_grace.htm">Mercy and Grace</a></b><br>Implicit in this verse is the theme of God's mercy and grace, foundational concepts in the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_mercy.htm">Understanding God's Mercy</a></b><br>Recognize that God's mercy is not based on our merit but on His character.
