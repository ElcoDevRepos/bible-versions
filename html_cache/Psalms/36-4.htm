In biblical times, the bed was often a place of reflection and planning, as seen in <a href="/micah/2.htm">Micah 2:1</a>, where individuals devise iniquity upon their beds. This reflects a heart that is not at peace, constantly scheming rather than seeking righteousness. The imagery of plotting on one's bed underscores the pervasive nature of sin, as it infiltrates even the most private and personal spaces of life.<p><b>he sets himself on a path that is not good;</b><br>The concept of a "path" in Scripture often symbolizes one's way of life or moral direction. <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a> warns against entering the path of the wicked, emphasizing the importance of choosing a righteous path. This phrase indicates a deliberate choice to pursue a lifestyle contrary to God's will. The "path that is not good" suggests a trajectory leading away from divine truth and towards destruction, reminiscent of the broad road leading to destruction mentioned in <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>.<p><b>he fails to reject evil.</b><br>This phrase highlights a lack of discernment and moral fortitude. In the biblical context, rejecting evil is a fundamental aspect of living a life pleasing to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>, which instructs believers to abhor what is evil. The failure to reject evil implies a passive acceptance or even an embrace of sin, contrasting with the active resistance required of the faithful. This failure can be seen as a rejection of the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, which advises not to be wise in one's own eyes but to fear the Lord and shun evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/36.htm">Psalm 36</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
