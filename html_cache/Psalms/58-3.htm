The concept of being "estranged" implies a separation from righteousness and God from the very beginning of life. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>, where David acknowledges being sinful from birth. The imagery of the "womb" emphasizes the depth and early onset of this estrangement, indicating that wickedness is not merely a result of environment or upbringing but is innate. This idea is consistent with the biblical narrative of the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where sin entered the world through Adam and Eve, affecting all their descendants.<p><b>the liars go astray from birth.</b><br>The term "liars" here can be understood as those who are deceitful, a characteristic often associated with the wicked throughout Scripture. Going "astray" suggests a deviation from the path of truth and righteousness, reinforcing the idea of an inherent sinful nature. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The concept of going astray from birth highlights the universality of sin and the need for divine intervention for redemption. In a broader biblical context, this underscores the necessity of Jesus Christ's redemptive work, as He is the truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and the one who brings reconciliation between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>This term refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws and righteousness.

The use of "from the womb" emphasizes the inherent nature of wickedness in humanity due to original sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/liars.htm">Liars</a></b><br>Those who speak falsehoods and deceive others.

What the psalmist means is that those who ultimately become heinous sinners, for the most part show, even from their early childhood, a strong tendency towards evil. He implies that with others the case is different.
