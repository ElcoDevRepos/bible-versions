This is seen in the story of Joseph in Egypt, where God granted him favor in the eyes of Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>). Similarly, during the Babylonian exile, God moved the heart of King Cyrus to allow the Israelites to return to their homeland (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-3</a>). This divine intervention underscores the theme of God's providence and His ability to influence the hearts of rulers and nations.<p><b>to all who held them captive.</b><br>The Israelites experienced captivity under various empires, including Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. Each captivity was a result of their disobedience, yet God remained faithful to His covenant. The phrase suggests a universal compassion from their captors, which can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect and eventually restore His people. This also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who frees believers from the captivity of sin (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The historical context of these captivities serves as a backdrop for understanding God's redemptive plan throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people who often found themselves in captivity due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/captors.htm">Captors</a></b><br>Various nations and peoples who held the Israelites in captivity, such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion.htm">God's Compassion</a></b><br>The divine intervention where God stirred the hearts of the captors to show mercy to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken from their homeland and lived under foreign rule.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/return_from_exile.htm">Return from Exile</a></b><br>The eventual restoration and return of the Israelites to their land, facilitated by God's compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_hearts.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Hearts</a></b><br>God has the power to influence the hearts of even those who do not know Him, as seen in His ability to make captors show compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_repentance.htm">The Role of Repentance</a></b><br>The Israelites' return to God often preceded His acts of compassion, highlighting the importance of repentance in our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_captivity.htm">Hope in Captivity</a></b><br>Even in dire circumstances, believers can trust that God is working behind the scenes to bring about His purposes and show mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercessory_prayer.htm">Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Like Nehemiah, believers should pray for God's favor and compassion in difficult situations, trusting in His ability to change hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's repeated disobedience, God remained faithful to His covenant, reminding us of His unwavering commitment to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_106_46_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 106:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_46_God_s_mercy_shown.htm">How does Psalm 106:46 demonstrate God's mercy towards His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_recall_God_s_compassion_daily.htm">What actions can we take to remember God's compassion in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_46_and_Deut_30_3_connection.htm">How does Psalm 106:46 connect to God's promises in Deuteronomy 30:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_show_God_s_compassion.htm">In what ways can we show compassion to others as God does?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_deliverance_in_trials.htm">How can we trust God's deliverance in difficult situations, as seen in Psalm 106:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_46_God_s_mercy_despite_sin.htm">How does Psalm 106:46 demonstrate God's mercy towards His people despite their disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_106_46.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 106:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_46_and_divine_compassion.htm">How does Psalm 106:46 reflect the theme of divine compassion in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_106.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 106?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'cut_off'_mean.htm">Has the darkness overcome it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_can_we_be_sure_of_god's_promises.htm">How does testing strengthen faith according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_psalm_126's_restoration.htm">Is there any archaeological or textual evidence confirming the miraculous restoration claimed in Psalm 126, beyond interpreted metaphor or tradition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_poor_devout_reconcile_psalm_112_3.htm">Psalm 112:3 declares that the righteous will enjoy wealth and riches;
