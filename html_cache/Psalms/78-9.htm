This tribe was known for its strength and prominence among the northern tribes. In biblical history, Ephraim often represented the northern kingdom of Israel. The mention of "archers" suggests a group skilled in warfare, as archery was a significant military skill in ancient times. The tribe of Ephraim was expected to be a leader in battle, given its size and influence. This phrase highlights the tribe's potential and the expectation of their role in Israel's military endeavors.<p><b>turned back</b><br>This phrase indicates a failure or retreat in the face of conflict. In the context of Israel's history, turning back in battle was seen as a lack of faith or trust in God's promises and power. The act of retreating could symbolize a spiritual failure, reflecting a broader theme of disobedience and lack of reliance on God. This failure is often contrasted with the victories achieved when Israel trusted in God, as seen in other biblical narratives.<p><b>on the day of battle</b><br>The "day of battle" refers to a specific time of conflict or warfare. In the biblical context, battles were often seen as tests of faith and obedience to God. The failure of Ephraim on this day serves as a reminder of the consequences of not trusting in God's strength. This phrase can be connected to other instances in Scripture where God fought for Israel when they were faithful, such as the battles led by Joshua.
