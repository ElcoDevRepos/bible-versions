The act of gaping or opening the mouth wide is often associated with scorn and ridicule in biblical literature. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, public shaming was a powerful tool used to discredit and humiliate individuals. This expression of hostility is reminiscent of the treatment Jesus received during His trial and crucifixion, as recorded in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>), where He was mocked and insulted by onlookers. The psalmist's experience foreshadows the suffering of Christ, highlighting the theme of the righteous suffering unjustly.<p><b>&#8220;Aha, aha!</b><br>The repetition of "Aha" is an expression of malicious delight and triumph over the perceived downfall of the psalmist. In the Hebrew language, such repetition emphasizes the intensity of the emotion. This taunt reflects the enemies' belief that they have gained the upper hand. The use of "Aha" is also found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3 and 26</a>:2, where it is used by nations rejoicing over Israel's misfortunes. This highlights a recurring theme of adversaries taking pleasure in the suffering of God's people, which is ultimately condemned by God.<p><b>Our eyes have seen!</b><br>This declaration suggests that the enemies believe they have witnessed the psalmist's failure or downfall. In the biblical context, seeing is often associated with understanding or perceiving truth. However, the enemies' claim here is ironic, as their perception is flawed and based on malice rather than truth. This phrase can be connected to the false witnesses who accused Jesus, as seen in <a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>, where they claimed to have seen and heard things that were not true. The psalmist's cry for vindication is a plea for God to reveal the truth and bring justice, a theme that resonates throughout the Psalms and is fulfilled in the ultimate vindication of Christ through His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's intervention against his enemies.
