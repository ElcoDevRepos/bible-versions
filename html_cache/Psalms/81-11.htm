Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly calls His people to listen and obey (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The Hebrew word for "listen" implies not just hearing but also responding with action. This reflects the covenant relationship where God speaks, and His people are expected to respond in faith and obedience. The failure to listen is a rejection of God's authority and wisdom, which is a central issue in the prophetic books (<a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9-11</a>).<p><b>and Israel would not obey Me</b><br>The term "obey" in Hebrew is often linked with the concept of "hearing" and "doing." Israel's refusal to obey is not just a matter of disobedience but a breach of the covenant established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This disobedience is a recurring issue that leads to various consequences, including exile and suffering. The historical context shows that Israel's disobedience often involved idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, contrary to God's commands (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the need for a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father and enables believers to do the same through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The speaker in this verse, expressing His lament over Israel's disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God who are being addressed in this Psalm, representing the collective nation that has turned away from God's commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalm_81.htm">Psalm 81</a></b><br>- A psalm attributed to Asaph, focusing on God's deliverance and the people's disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>- A Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir, traditionally credited with writing several psalms, including <a href="/bsb/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>- The historical backdrop of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt, referenced earlier in the psalm as a reminder of God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>Listening to God is crucial for maintaining a relationship with Him.
