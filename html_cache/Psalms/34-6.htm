At the time of writing, David was likely reflecting on his experiences of distress and need, possibly during his flight from Saul or his time among the Philistines. The term "poor" here can denote not only material poverty but also a state of humility and desperation. In biblical context, calling out to God is a common expression of prayer and supplication, seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/120.htm">Psalm 120:1</a>, where the faithful cry out to God in times of need.<p><b>and the LORD heard him</b><br>The assurance that "the LORD heard him" emphasizes God's attentiveness to the cries of His people. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be responsive to those who seek Him earnestly. The idea of God hearing prayers is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>, which assures believers that God hears and answers prayers according to His will. This phrase underscores God's faithfulness and His role as a divine protector and provider.<p><b>He saved him from all his troubles</b><br>The deliverance mentioned here is both physical and spiritual. Historically, David experienced numerous instances of divine intervention, such as his escape from King Saul and his victory over Goliath. Theologically, this deliverance can be seen as a type of salvation that points to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who saves believers from sin and eternal separation from God. This phrase also connects to other scriptures that speak of God's saving power, such as <a href="/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>, where God is depicted as a rescuer from distress and danger.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, David wrote this psalm after pretending to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away.
