The concept of God shaping hearts is rooted in the biblical understanding that God is the Creator and Sustainer of all life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This shaping implies God's active role in guiding and influencing human desires and decisions, aligning with passages like <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which speaks of God directing the hearts of kings. The idea of God shaping hearts also connects to the promise of a new heart and spirit found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, pointing to the transformative work of God in the lives of believers.<p><b>He considers all their works.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's omniscience and justice. The notion that God considers all works suggests a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of human actions. This aligns with passages such as <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>, which states that nothing is hidden from God's sight. The idea of God considering works is also tied to the biblical theme of judgment, where God assesses the deeds of individuals (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). This phrase reassures believers that God is aware of their actions and intentions, providing both accountability and comfort. It also reflects the biblical principle that faith and works are interconnected, as seen in <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>, where faith without works is described as dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the one who shapes human hearts and observes their actions.
