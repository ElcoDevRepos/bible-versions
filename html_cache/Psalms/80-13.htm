In biblical times, boars were considered unclean animals (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>), representing chaos and destruction. The forest signifies a place of danger and unpredictability, often used metaphorically for the nations surrounding Israel. Historically, this could refer to the Assyrian or Babylonian invasions, where foreign powers devastated the land of Israel. Theologically, it reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience and turning away from God, leading to divine judgment through foreign oppression.<p><b>and the creatures of the field feed upon it</b><br>This part of the verse continues the metaphor of destruction, with "creatures of the field" symbolizing various nations or groups that exploit Israel's vulnerability. In the ancient Near East, fields were vital for sustenance and prosperity, and their devastation would lead to famine and hardship. This imagery connects to the covenant curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience results in the land being overrun by enemies. It also foreshadows the scattering and suffering of Israel, pointing to the need for divine intervention and restoration. In a typological sense, it highlights the need for a shepherd, a role fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who protects and restores His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boar_from_the_forest.htm">The Boar from the Forest</a></b><br>Symbolic of destructive forces or enemies that threaten the people of Israel.
