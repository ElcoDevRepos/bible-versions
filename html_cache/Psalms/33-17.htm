The Israelites, however, were instructed not to rely on horses for their security (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), as their trust was to be in God alone. This phrase emphasizes the futility of relying on human or earthly means for deliverance. The horse, a symbol of might and speed, is inadequate for true salvation, which only God can provide. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on God is contrasted with reliance on human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>even its great strength cannot save.</b><br>Despite the horse's renowned power and speed, it is ultimately powerless to deliver true salvation. This highlights the limitations of human and earthly resources. The strength of a horse, no matter how impressive, is insufficient for the kind of deliverance that God offers. This echoes the biblical narrative where God often uses the weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), and where true strength is found in reliance on Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).
