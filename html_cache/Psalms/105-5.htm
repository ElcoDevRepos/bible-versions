In the context of the Israelites, this includes the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna in the wilderness. These wonders serve as a testament to God's power and faithfulness. The act of remembering is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of recalling God's past deeds to strengthen faith and trust in His future promises. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/7-18.htm">Deuteronomy 7:18-19</a>, where the Israelites are encouraged to remember God's mighty acts as a source of courage.<p><b>His marvels</b><br>The term "marvels" refers to extraordinary events that reveal God's divine intervention and sovereignty. These acts are not only historical but also serve as a foreshadowing of the ultimate marvel in the New Testament: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The marvels of God are meant to inspire awe and worship, reminding believers of His omnipotence and the miraculous nature of His works. In the broader biblical narrative, marvels often accompany God's deliverance and salvation, as seen in the miracles performed by Jesus during His earthly ministry.<p><b>and the judgments He has pronounced</b><br>This phrase highlights God's righteous judgments, which are both a warning and a guide for His people. In the Old Testament, God's judgments often came in the form of prophetic declarations and were fulfilled through historical events, such as the exile of Israel. These judgments serve as a reminder of God's holiness and justice, as well as His covenantal relationship with His people. They also point forward to the final judgment, as described in Revelation, where God's justice will be fully realized. The judgments are a call to repentance and obedience, underscoring the seriousness of sin and the need for redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one whose wonders, marvels, and judgments are to be remembered.

God&#8217;s people are not to let His works slip into the background of memory (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The wonders&#8221; look back to concrete acts&#8212;plagues on Egypt, the Red Sea crossing, manna in the wilderness (<a href="/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26&#8211;41</a>). They also reach forward, urging every generation to rehearse fresh testimonies of God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; This remembering fuels faith for present challenges. When David faced Goliath, he recalled earlier deliverances (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>). The pattern is the same for us: yesterday&#8217;s wonders anchor today&#8217;s obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His marvels</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Marvels&#8221; highlights the extraordinary, jaw-dropping nature of God&#8217;s deeds.

Rahab heard about the Red Sea miracle and concluded Israel&#8217;s God is &#8220;God in heaven above and on earth beneath&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10&#8211;11</a>). Our testimony of God&#8217;s marvels still opens hearts to the gospel today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the judgments He has pronounced</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Judgments&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s decisive interventions that vindicate righteousness and expose sin&#8212;plagues on Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>), the drowning of Pharaoh&#8217;s army (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>), and later acts like the exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Such judgments warn against unbelief (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5&#8211;11</a>) and reassure believers that evil will not finally triumph (<a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Remembering them balances our view of God: He is both Savior and Judge (<a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>).
