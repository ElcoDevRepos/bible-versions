Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>). The imagery of God's anger "burning" suggests an intense, consuming wrath, similar to a fire. This is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as a holy and just deity who cannot tolerate sin (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). The historical context includes Israel's repeated cycles of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance during the period of the Judges, as well as their later idolatry during the monarchy. This anger is not arbitrary but is a response to the violation of the covenant relationship established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24).<p><b>and He abhorred His own inheritance</b><br>The term "inheritance" refers to Israel, whom God chose as His special possession among all nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>). To "abhor" means to regard with disgust or hatred, indicating a severe divine displeasure. This reflects the gravity of Israel's sin, which led God to view them with revulsion, despite His covenant promises. The cultural context includes the ancient Near Eastern concept of a deity having a chosen people or land, which was a common motif. However, unlike other deities, the God of Israel's relationship with His people was based on moral and ethical standards. This phrase also connects to prophetic warnings found in books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where God expresses similar sentiments due to Israel's idolatry and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the wrath of God on behalf of humanity, becoming the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant promises and restoring the broken relationship between God and His people (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy, just, and righteous.

The little word &#8220;So&#8221; links that history to God&#8217;s response. Because Israel &#8220;rejected His statutes and despised His covenant&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>), this consequence is not random but logical. Like a parent who has warned many times, the Lord now moves from patience to discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the anger of the LORD</b><p>This is not capricious rage but righteous indignation arising from God&#8217;s holy character (<a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>). His anger is always measured and just, never sinful (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>). Scripture shows the same pattern when Israel worshiped the golden calf&#8212;&#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anger burned&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>)&#8212;yet even then Moses could intercede, proving that wrath and mercy are perfectly balanced in God (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>burned</b><p>A fire image highlights intensity and purity. Fire consumes what is corrupt while refining what is precious (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Here it consumes. Similar language appears when &#8220;the fire of the LORD burned among them&#8221; in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>). Rebellion piles up combustible material; eventually holiness ignites it (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against His people</b><p>The covenant nation is in view, not surrounding pagans. Privilege heightens accountability (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>). Though chosen, Israel is not exempt from discipline&#8212;if anything, they experience it first (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). God&#8217;s love for His people includes correction that may feel fierce but intends restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He abhorred</b><p>&#8220;Abhorred&#8221; conveys deep revulsion. Israel&#8217;s idolatry made what was meant to be holy appear repulsive (<a href="/jeremiah/44-4.htm">Jeremiah 44:4</a>). God&#8217;s disgust is moral, not emotional whim. <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> uses identical wording when Israel&#8217;s high places provoke disgust. The covenant imagery shows that sin violates relational intimacy, much like adultery in marriage (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His own inheritance</b><p>A stunning phrase&#8212;Israel is &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s portion&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>). Yet the Owner disowns what is polluted. Possession does not override purity. Even the land &#8220;vomited out&#8221; its inhabitants when corrupted (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>), so God&#8217;s inheritance can experience temporary rejection. Still, the covenant is not annulled; exile leads to eventual regathering (<a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40</a> teaches that persistent, unrepentant sin kindles God&#8217;s righteous anger, even toward those He has chosen as His special possession. The verse stands as a sober reminder: privilege invites accountability, holiness demands purity, and love will discipline. Yet the wider psalm also shows that divine wrath is never the last word; confession and covenant mercy ultimately prevail (<a href="/psalms/106-44.htm">Psalm 106:44-45</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/106.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40-43) Having made review of the sinful past, the poet briefly but impressively describes the punishment which once and again had fallen on the nation.
