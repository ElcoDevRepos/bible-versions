In ancient Near Eastern culture, a cup often symbolized one's fate or destiny, and in the context of scripture, it frequently represents God's wrath or blessing. The hand of the LORD signifies His sovereign control and authority over the affairs of humanity. This phrase sets the stage for understanding the nature of God's judgment as deliberate and purposeful.<p><b>full of foaming wine mixed with spices</b><br>The description of the wine as "foaming" suggests a potent and intoxicating drink, symbolizing the intensity and completeness of God's judgment. In ancient times, wine was often mixed with spices to enhance its flavor and potency, indicating that the judgment is not only powerful but also meticulously prepared. This imagery can be connected to the cup of wrath mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>, where nations are made to drink from the cup of God's wrath, leading to their downfall.<p><b>He pours from His cup</b><br>The act of pouring signifies the execution of judgment. It is a deliberate action by God, emphasizing His active role in administering justice. This phrase highlights the certainty and inevitability of divine judgment upon the wicked. The pouring out of the cup can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to judge sin and uphold righteousness, as seen throughout the prophetic books of the Old Testament.<p><b>and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to the dregs</b><br>The wicked are those who oppose God's will and live in rebellion against His commandments. The phrase "drink it down to the dregs" indicates that they will experience the full measure of God's judgment, leaving nothing behind. The dregs are the sediment at the bottom of a cup, symbolizing the most bitter and undesirable part. This complete consumption of the cup's contents underscores the totality of God's judgment. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, where those who worship the beast will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of His anger.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who holds the cup of judgment, symbolizing His authority and power over the earth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and His ways, destined to experience His judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup.htm">The Cup</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's wrath and judgment, often used in the Old Testament to symbolize divine retribution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foaming_wine_mixed_with_spices.htm">Foaming Wine Mixed with Spices</a></b><br>Represents the intensity and completeness of God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The realm where God's judgment is executed, affecting all inhabitants, especially the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_justice.htm">Understanding God's Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment is inevitable and just.

Every element of judgment is measured out with precision, showing both God&#8217;s justice and His meticulous awareness of every sin (<a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The vivid description rules out any idea that divine wrath is accidental or haphazard; it is intentional, settled, and thorough.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He pours from His cup</b><p>&#8226; God is not merely holding the cup&#8212;He tips it.

The patience of God has a limit; when that limit is reached, He acts (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the wicked of the earth drink it down to the dregs</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All&#8221; widens the scope: no evildoer escapes (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Drink it down&#8221; shows compulsory reception; the wicked cannot refuse what God decrees (<a href="/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;To the dregs&#8221; means every drop&#8212;complete, exhaustive judgment with nothing left untasted (<a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase also reassures believers: injustice will not stand forever; God sees, remembers, and will settle accounts (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a> paints a sober but hope-infused picture of divine justice. The Lord holds a carefully prepared cup of wrath and, at the appointed time, pours it out so that every unrepentant evildoer must drink it completely. The passage affirms God&#8217;s absolute control, His meticulous fairness, and the certainty that evil will meet its full recompense. For the faithful, the verse is a reminder to rest in God&#8217;s righteous timing; for the wicked, it is a clear warning that judgment is sure and inescapable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/75.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">A cup.</span>--The figure of the cup of Divine fury is developed, as <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm" title="On the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.">Psalm 11:6</a> compared with <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a> shows, from the more general one which represents life itself as a draught which must be drunk, bitter or sweet, according to the portion assigned.
