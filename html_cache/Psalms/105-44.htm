This act is rooted in the Abrahamic Covenant, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit a specific land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The "nations" here refers to the various Canaanite tribes that inhabited the land before the Israelites' conquest. This transfer of land is a demonstration of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises. It also serves as a type of the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<p><b>that they might inherit the fruit of others&#8217; labor</b><br>This phrase highlights the Israelites receiving the benefits of the land without having to toil for them initially. The "fruit of others' labor" includes the cities, vineyards, and fields established by the previous inhabitants (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>). This concept is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating God's provision and grace. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, which is not earned by works but given by grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Theologically, it underscores the idea of divine justice and the redistribution of resources according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who gives the lands to His people.

The verse is celebrating a historical fact: God literally transferred real territory into Israel&#8217;s possession.<p>&#8226; This recalls <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, where God first promised Abram, &#8220;To your offspring I will give this land.&#8221; Centuries later <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a> records, &#8220;So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had spoken to Moses.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1&#8211;3</a> echoes the same miracle: &#8220;It was not by their sword that they won the land&#8230; it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The conquest narrative (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27&#8211;31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1&#8211;2</a>) shows God driving out nations far stronger than Israel, proving that the victory was solely His gift.<p>&#8226; This granting of territory was not symbolic; it was concrete.
