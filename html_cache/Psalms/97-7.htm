In the ancient Near Eastern context, idol worship was prevalent among surrounding nations, including the Canaanites, Egyptians, and Babylonians. The Hebrew Scriptures consistently condemn the worship of graven images, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The shame mentioned here is both a present reality and a prophetic declaration of the ultimate downfall of idolaters. The prophets, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>), often mocked the absurdity of worshiping man-made objects, emphasizing that these idols have no power or life.<p><b>those who boast in idols.</b><br>Boasting in idols implies a misplaced confidence and pride in objects that cannot save or deliver. This reflects a deeper spiritual blindness and rebellion against the true God. Historically, Israel struggled with idolatry, often adopting the gods of neighboring peoples, which led to their downfall and exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>). The New Testament echoes this sentiment, warning against covetousness, which is equated with idolatry (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). The boasting here contrasts with the biblical call to boast only in the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>).<p><b>Worship Him, all you gods!</b><br>This command underscores the supremacy of the God of Israel over all other so-called gods. In the ancient world, polytheism was common, with each nation having its pantheon. The psalmist calls even these "gods" to acknowledge the sovereignty of the one true God. This can be seen as a poetic expression, emphasizing that all spiritual beings, whether real or imagined, are subject to God's authority. The Apostle Paul affirms this in the New Testament, declaring that every knee will bow to Jesus Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all spiritual forces, as depicted in Revelation, where every power and authority is subjected to Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/worshipers_of_images.htm">Worshipers of Images</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who engage in idolatry, placing their trust and reverence in man-made objects rather than the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Physical representations or symbols that people worship instead of God.

People glory in what they think they control, yet it will betray them (<a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse warns God&#8217;s people not merely to reject idols but also to reject the pride that produces them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Worship Him</b><p>&#8226; After condemning false worship, the psalmist issues the positive command: &#8220;Worship Him.&#8221; True worship is exclusive and centered on the LORD alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is striking&#8212;shame follows idolatry, but honor and joy accompany worship of the one true God (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The imperative highlights that worship is not optional; it is the created purpose of every being (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all you gods!</b><p>&#8226; The phrase echoes <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a> and is echoed again in <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a> (&#8220;Let all God&#8217;s angels worship Him&#8221;).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gods&#8221; points to spiritual beings (angels) and any earthly powers mistakenly treated as divine (<a href="/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>).
