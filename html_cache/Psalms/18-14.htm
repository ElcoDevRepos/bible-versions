The imagery of God shooting arrows symbolizes His power and precision in executing judgment against His enemies. In ancient warfare, arrows were a primary weapon, representing both offensive capability and the ability to strike from a distance. This imagery is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, where God prepares His deadly weapons. The scattering of foes indicates a complete and overwhelming victory, reminiscent of God's deliverance of Israel from their enemies throughout biblical history, such as the defeat of the Egyptians at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>).<p><b>He hurled lightning and routed them.</b><br>Lightning is often associated with God's presence and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. The use of lightning here emphasizes the divine nature of the victory, as lightning is beyond human control and signifies God's direct intervention. The routing of enemies suggests a chaotic and decisive defeat, aligning with other biblical accounts where God intervenes supernaturally, such as the battle against the Amorites in <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>, where God threw hailstones from heaven. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the New Testament, is depicted as having authority over nature and spiritual forces, as seen in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a> when He calms the storm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies and from the hand of Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as a divine warrior who intervenes on behalf of His people, using elements of nature as instruments of His power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies/foes.htm">Enemies/Foes</a></b><br>The adversaries of David, representing any force or entity that opposes God's will and His anointed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lightning.htm">Lightning</a></b><br>A natural phenomenon used metaphorically to describe God's power and might in battle, symbolizing His ability to overcome and scatter the enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrows.htm">Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's precise and effective intervention against His enemies, demonstrating His control over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_a_divine_warrior.htm">God as a Divine Warrior</a></b><br>Recognize that God fights for His people and has the power to overcome any adversary.

They are abruptly recalled to our remembrance in the suffix ("them") of the verbs in this verse. So the LXX. and Vulg. Many ancient interpreters, however, understood by <span class= "ital">them </span>"the lightnings," while Ewald would carry the pronoun on to the "waters" in the next verse. Instead of "shot" (<span class= "ital">rab</span>) many render as if it were the adjective "many," "his numerous lightnings."
