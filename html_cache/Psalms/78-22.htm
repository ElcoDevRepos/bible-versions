Despite witnessing numerous miracles, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna, they struggled with unbelief. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God's people often falter in their trust. The lack of belief is not just intellectual doubt but a failure to trust in God's character and promises. This is reminiscent of the Israelites' reaction in <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, where God expresses frustration over their persistent unbelief despite His signs. The New Testament echoes this sentiment in <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>, which attributes the Israelites' inability to enter the Promised Land to unbelief, serving as a warning to believers to maintain faith.<p><b>or rely on His salvation</b><br>The Israelites' failure to rely on God's salvation underscores their dependence on visible, immediate solutions rather than trusting in God's long-term deliverance. In the context of the Exodus, "salvation" refers to God's deliverance from Egypt and His ongoing provision and protection. This lack of reliance is a spiritual issue, reflecting a deeper heart problem of self-reliance and doubt. The concept of salvation in the Old Testament often involves physical deliverance, but it also points to a greater spiritual salvation fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, salvation is fully realized through Christ's atoning work, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasize faith and reliance on God's grace. This phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting in God's ultimate plan for salvation, both temporally and eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt but struggled with faith and obedience in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who provided salvation and sustenance to the Israelites, yet was met with disbelief.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, a place of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_trust_in_god.htm">Faith and Trust in God</a></b><br>True faith involves trusting in God's promises and His ability to save, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_unbelief.htm">Consequences of Unbelief</a></b><br>Unbelief can lead to spiritual stagnation and missing out on God's blessings, as seen in the Israelites' wilderness experience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite human unbelief, God remains faithful and continues to offer salvation and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_the_past.htm">Learning from the Past</a></b><br>The history of Israel serves as a lesson for believers today to trust in God's salvation and not repeat the mistakes of disbelief.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god's_salvation.htm">Reliance on God's Salvation</a></b><br>Salvation is not just a one-time event but a continual reliance on God's grace and provision in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_22_Trust_God_s_provision_today.htm">How does Psalm 78:22 highlight the importance of trusting God's provision today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Effects_of_disbelief_in_God_s_salvation.htm">What consequences arise from not believing in God's "salvation" as seen in Psalm 78:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_strengthen_faith_avoid_disbelief.htm">How can we strengthen our faith to avoid the disbelief mentioned in Psalm 78:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Contrast_disbelief_in_Ps_78_22_Heb_3_12.htm">Compare Israel's disbelief in Psalm 78:22 with Hebrews 3:12.

The section surrounding verse 22 recalls the wilderness journey after the Exodus:<p>&#8226; Verses 17&#8211;20 describe Israel&#8217;s complaints: &#8220;They spoke against God, saying, &#8216;Can God spread a table in the wilderness?&#8217;&#8221; (v. 19).<p>&#8226; God graciously gave water from the rock and manna from heaven (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>; <a href="/bsb/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet &#8220;they continued to sin against Him&#8221; (v. 17). Their unbelief is stated plainly in our focus text: &#8220;because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>).<p>Cross references reinforce the setting of hard-heartedness: <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-19</a> warns believers by retelling the same episode, and Jude 5 reminds us that the Lord &#8220;destroyed those who did not believe.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Charge: Unbelief</b><p>Verse 22 names two failures:<p>&#8226; &#8220;They did not believe God.&#8221; Doubt in His character and promises.
