The term "Almighty" emphasizes God's omnipotence, often used in the Old Testament to denote His supreme authority. The scattering of kings suggests a divine intervention where God disrupts the plans of powerful leaders, reminiscent of events like the defeat of the Canaanite kings in <a href="/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a> or the victory over the Midianites in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. This scattering can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect and establish Israel, His chosen people. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of the world, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<p><b>it was like the snow falling on Zalmon</b><br>Zalmon is a mountain mentioned in <a href="/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>, located near Shechem. The imagery of snow falling on Zalmon conveys purity, transformation, and the overwhelming nature of God's actions. Snow, often rare in the region, symbolizes a sudden and complete change, much like the unexpected and decisive victories God grants His people. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for the cleansing and renewal brought by God's intervention, paralleling the spiritual renewal found in Christ's redemptive work. The whiteness of snow may also symbolize righteousness and holiness, attributes of God that are imparted to believers through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

91:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> as a whole celebrates the LORD&#8217;s march from Sinai to Zion, underscoring His absolute power. The verse&#8217;s opening reminds readers that every victory flows from His sovereign hand, never from human might (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>scattered the kings</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Scattered&#8221; depicts decisive, disorderly defeat.
