In ancient Israel, the role of the choirmaster was crucial in leading the congregation in song and worship. This suggests that the themes of repentance and forgiveness in this psalm were meant to be shared and internalized by the community.<p><b>A Psalm of David.</b><br>David, the second king of Israel, is traditionally credited with composing many of the psalms. His life, marked by both profound faith and significant moral failings, provides a rich backdrop for understanding the depth of his repentance. This psalm is a personal reflection of his relationship with God, showcasing his understanding of divine grace and mercy.<p><b>When Nathan the prophet came to him after his adultery with Bathsheba.</b><br>This historical context is crucial for understanding the psalm. Nathan's confrontation with David is recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>, where Nathan uses a parable to reveal David's sin. This moment is pivotal in David's life, leading to his deep repentance. The cultural context of the time viewed adultery as a grave sin, and David's actions had severe consequences, both personally and for his kingdom.<p><b>Have mercy on me, O God,</b><br>David's plea for mercy reflects his awareness of his sin and his need for divine forgiveness. The Hebrew word for mercy here conveys a deep sense of compassion and loving-kindness. This appeal to God's mercy is a central theme in the Old Testament, where God's character is often described as merciful and gracious.<p><b>according to Your loving devotion;</b><br>The term "loving devotion" is often translated as "steadfast love" or "covenant faithfulness." It refers to God's unwavering commitment to His people, rooted in the covenant He established with Israel. This phrase underscores the belief that God's mercy is not arbitrary but is based on His faithful character.<p><b>according to Your great compassion,</b><br>The word "compassion" here emphasizes God's tender mercy and willingness to forgive. It is a reminder of God's empathetic nature, as seen throughout the scriptures, where He is portrayed as a compassionate Father who understands human frailty.<p><b>blot out my transgressions.</b><br>The imagery of "blotting out" suggests the removal or erasure of sin, akin to wiping a slate clean. This reflects the biblical concept of forgiveness, where God not only forgives but also forgets the sins of those who repent. This idea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, where God promises to remember sins no more. David's request highlights his desire for a restored relationship with God, free from the burden of his past sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, King David, wrote this psalm as a heartfelt plea for mercy after being confronted by the prophet Nathan regarding his sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of David's plea, God is portrayed as merciful and compassionate, willing to forgive those who genuinely repent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Nathan's confrontation with David is the catalyst for the writing of this psalm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>Her involvement with David is the context for the sin that David is repenting for in this psalm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigned as king and where these events took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_mercy.htm">Understanding God's Mercy</a></b><br>Recognize that God's mercy is not based on our merit but on His loving devotion and compassion.

It is not correet to say that "loving-kindness implies a covenant" (Cheyne), since God is "good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works" (<a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions</span>. David's first prayer is for pity; his second, to have his offences "blotted out," or "wiped out" - entirely removed from God's book (comp. <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>). He says "my transgressions," in the plural, because "his great sin did not stand alone - adultery was followed by treachery and murder" (Canon Cook). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/51-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the choirmaster.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;na&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
