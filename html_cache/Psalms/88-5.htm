In biblical context, being "forsaken" is a powerful expression of feeling separated from God, akin to the lament of Jesus on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). The psalmist's expression here can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also forsaken in death for the sake of humanity's redemption.<p><b>like the slain who lie in the grave</b><br>The imagery of the slain lying in the grave evokes the finality and silence of death. In ancient Israel, the grave (Sheol) was seen as a place of no return, where the dead were cut off from the living and from God. This reflects the cultural understanding of death as a separation from the covenant community and God's presence, as seen in <a href="/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9-10</a>.<p><b>whom You remember no more</b><br>In the Hebrew Bible, to be remembered by God is to be in His favor and care. The psalmist's lament that God no longer remembers the dead underscores the perceived absence of divine intervention or blessing. This contrasts with the hope found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15-16</a>, where God assures His people that He will not forget them.<p><b>who are cut off from Your care</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies a complete disconnection from God's protection and provision. This phrase highlights the psalmist's feeling of being beyond the reach of God's mercy, similar to the exile experience of Israel when they felt abandoned by God (<a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that Christ endured on the cross, emphasizing the depth of His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Heman the Ezrahite)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, traditionally identified as Heman the Ezrahite, is expressing deep anguish and a sense of abandonment by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Refers to those who have passed away, symbolizing a state of separation and forgottenness, both physically and spiritually.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grave.htm">The Grave (Sheol)</a></b><br>In Hebrew, "Sheol" is the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and separation from the living and, metaphorically, from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care.htm">God's Care</a></b><br>The psalmist feels cut off from God's providence and attention, highlighting a perceived absence of divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slain.htm">The Slain</a></b><br>Represents those who have died violently or prematurely, emphasizing the psalmist's feeling of being spiritually "slain" or defeated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_despair.htm">The Reality of Despair</a></b><br>Acknowledge that even faithful believers can experience profound despair and feelings of abandonment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_lament.htm">The Importance of Lament</a></b><br>Lament is a valid and biblical way to express our deepest emotions to God, serving as a form of prayer and communication.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_silence.htm">God's Presence in Silence</a></b><br>Even when God seems silent, He is present.
