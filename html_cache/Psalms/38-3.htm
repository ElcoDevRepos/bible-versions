In the Hebrew context, the concept of "soundness" often refers to wholeness or health, indicating that the psalmist feels a profound lack of well-being. The idea of God's anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where divine wrath is often depicted as a response to sin and disobedience (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27-28</a>). The psalmist's condition can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual consequences of sin, which disrupts the harmony between God and humanity. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the need for repentance and reconciliation with God.<p><b>there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.</b><br>The absence of rest in the psalmist's bones suggests a deep, internal turmoil that affects even the physical body. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bones were often seen as the seat of strength and vitality, so their unrest signifies a profound weakness or affliction. The connection between sin and physical suffering is a theme found throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-4</a>, where unconfessed sin leads to physical and emotional distress. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that sin has tangible consequences, affecting not only one's spiritual state but also one's physical and emotional well-being. It also points to the need for confession and forgiveness, which are central to the message of redemption found in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who offers rest for the weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/38.htm">Psalm 38</a>, David is expressing deep personal anguish and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being to whom David is speaking, acknowledging His anger and the consequences of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The transgression that has led to David's physical and spiritual distress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/body/bones.htm">Body/Bones</a></b><br>Metaphors for David's physical and spiritual state, indicating a lack of peace and health.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/anger_of_god.htm">Anger of God</a></b><br>Represents divine displeasure towards sin, which David feels acutely.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_sin's_consequences.htm">The Reality of Sin's Consequences</a></b><br>Sin affects both the spiritual and physical aspects of life.
