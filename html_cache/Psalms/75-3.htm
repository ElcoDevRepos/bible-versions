In biblical context, earthquakes often symbolize God's power and judgment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>). The imagery of the earth quaking can also represent the upheaval of nations or the shaking of human confidence in worldly systems. Historically, the ancient Near East experienced frequent seismic activity, making this imagery relatable to the original audience. Theologically, it underscores the transient nature of human life and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>it is I who bear up its pillars</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's sovereignty and sustaining power over creation. The "pillars" symbolize the foundational structures of the earth, suggesting that God maintains order amidst chaos. This imagery is consistent with other scriptures that depict God as the sustainer of the universe (e.g., <a href="/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). Theologically, it reassures believers of God's control and faithfulness, even when circumstances seem unstable. It also points to God's role as the ultimate judge and ruler, who upholds justice and righteousness.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often interpreted as a pause for reflection or a musical interlude, inviting the reader or listener to contemplate the preceding message. In the context of this verse, it serves as a moment to meditate on God's power and faithfulness in sustaining the world. It encourages believers to trust in God's unchanging nature and to find peace in His sovereignty, despite the uncertainties of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the one who sustains and stabilizes the earth amidst chaos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>Represents the world and its inhabitants, who are experiencing turmoil and instability.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillars.htm">Pillars</a></b><br>Symbolic of the foundational support that God provides to maintain order and stability in creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_control.htm">God's Sovereignty and Control</a></b><br>In times of chaos and uncertainty, believers can find comfort in knowing that God is in control and upholds the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stability_in_faith.htm">Stability in Faith</a></b><br>Just as God bears up the pillars of the earth, He provides stability in our lives when we place our trust in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_god's_power.htm">Reflecting on God's Power</a></b><br>The use of "Selah" invites us to pause and reflect on God's mighty power and His role as the sustainer of all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Recognizing our dependence on God for stability encourages humility and a deeper reliance on His strength and wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_trials.htm">Encouragement in Trials</a></b><br>This verse serves as a reminder that no matter how much the world shakes, God&#8217;s support is unwavering and reliable.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_75_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 75:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_75_3_God_s_rule_in_chaos.htm">How does Psalm 75:3 illustrate God's sovereignty in times of chaos and instability?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_role_in_creation_via_pillars.htm">What does "I steady its pillars" reveal about God's role in creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Finding_comfort_in_God_s_control.htm">How can believers find comfort in God's control during personal or global crises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_75_3_to_God_s_sustaining_power.htm">Connect Psalm 75:3 with other scriptures emphasizing God's sustaining power.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Psalm_75_3_on_decisions.htm">How should understanding God's sovereignty in Psalm 75:3 affect daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_75_3_God_s_rule_in_chaos_2.htm">How does Psalm 75:3 reflect God's sovereignty in times of chaos and instability?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_75_3_s_writing.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 75:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_75_3_and_divine_judgment_link.htm">How does Psalm 75:3 relate to the theme of divine judgment?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_75.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 75?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_75_3_align_with_astronomy.htm">Psalm 75:3 refers to God holding the earth&#8217;s &#8220;pillars,&#8221; which conflicts with modern astronomy; how does this align with a spherical planet suspended in space?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'consolation_of_israel'_mean.htm">What does 'The Pillars of the Earth' signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'the_pillars'_mean.htm">What does "The Pillars of the Earth" signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_god_and_science_on_quakes.htm">Job 9:6 mentions God shaking the earth, yet modern science explains earthquakes through tectonic activity&#8212;how do we reconcile these views? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 75:3 Mean</div><b>When the earth and all its dwellers quake</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist pictures universal instability&#8212;political, moral, natural.
