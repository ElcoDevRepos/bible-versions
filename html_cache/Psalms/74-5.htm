In biblical times, axes were common tools for both construction and destruction, symbolizing power and authority. The use of axes in this context may allude to the Babylonians or other invading forces who destroyed the temple, as described in <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>. The imagery of wielding axes can also be seen as a metaphor for judgment, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>, where the sound of an army is likened to the cutting down of a forest.<p><b>in a thicket of trees</b><br>The thicket of trees represents a dense and tangled area, symbolizing complexity and perhaps the perceived strength of the temple or the people of Israel. In ancient Near Eastern culture, forests and thickets were often seen as places of mystery and danger, sometimes associated with the dwelling places of deities or spirits. The destruction of such a thicket could symbolize the breaking down of barriers or the removal of protection. This imagery may also connect to <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>, where the Lord is described as cutting down the thickets of the forest with an axe, symbolizing divine judgment and the clearing away of obstacles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/74.htm">Psalm 74</a>, Asaph was a Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir.

Earlier verses (<a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3&#8211;4</a>) mention enemies roaring in God&#8217;s meeting place, setting up their own emblems, and then our verse zooms in on the sound and sight of relentless destruction. The picture is vivid, matching <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9&#8211;10</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18&#8211;19</a> where Babylon&#8217;s troops burned and broke every sacred article they could reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like men</b><p>&#8226; The comparison stresses ordinariness: ordinary soldiers, not divine beings, shattering holy things.<p>&#8226; Yet these &#8220;men&#8221; seem unstoppable for the moment, echoing <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6&#8211;11</a> where God allows the Chaldeans to march in unchecked.<p>&#8226; The psalmist&#8217;s choice to call them merely &#8220;men&#8221; reminds us of <a href="/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;Let the nations know they are but men&#8221;&#8212;hinting that their triumph will be short-lived under God&#8217;s ultimate rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wielding axes</b><p>&#8226; Axes are tools of forceful penetration.
