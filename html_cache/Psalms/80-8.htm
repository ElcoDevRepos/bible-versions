The vine is a common biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>). The imagery of uprooting suggests God's active role in delivering His people from slavery. Historically, the Exodus is a foundational event for Israel, marking their transition from bondage to becoming a nation. The vine metaphor emphasizes the care and purpose God had for Israel, intending them to flourish in a new land.<p><b>You drove out the nations</b><br>This part highlights God's intervention in clearing the Promised Land of its previous inhabitants to make way for Israel. The conquest of Canaan, as described in the books of Joshua and Judges, involved the displacement of various Canaanite tribes. This action fulfilled God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and demonstrated His sovereignty and faithfulness. Theologically, it underscores God's judgment against the nations for their iniquity and His covenantal commitment to Israel.<p><b>and transplanted it.</b><br>The act of transplanting the vine signifies God's establishment of Israel in the Promised Land. This imagery suggests careful placement and nurturing, indicating God's intention for Israel to grow and bear fruit in a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The transplanting also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being grafted into the spiritual vine, Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>). This connection emphasizes continuity in God's redemptive plan and the call for His people to remain in Him to bear fruit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/vine.htm">Vine</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the nation of Israel.

The history of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> begins with the Exodus. The nation was transplanted from Egypt into a soil better fitted for it by the loving hand of God, in order that it might have ample room to grow up and develop itself freely. God "brought it out of Egypt," not merely in the exercise of his ordinary providence over humanity, but by an active exertion of his Almighty power, and a long series of miraculous manifestations, without which the transfer could not have been effected. He then cast out the heathen, and planted it - drove out, that is, before Israel the seven nations of the Hivites, Hittites, Gergashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Jebusites, and, having driven them out, "planted" in his own people (see <a href="/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/80-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You uprooted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(tas&#183;s&#238;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5265.htm">Strong's 5265: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull up, the tent-pins, start on a, journey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a vine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1453;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ge&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1612.htm">Strong's 1612: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vine, the grape</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Egypt;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
