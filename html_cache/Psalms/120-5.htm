It reflects a deep sense of sorrow and dissatisfaction with their current circumstances. The use of "woe" is common in biblical literature to express grief or a cry for help, often seen in prophetic writings (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). It indicates a longing for deliverance and a recognition of the fallen state of the world.<p><b>that I dwell in Meshech</b><br>Meshech is a region often associated with distant lands and peoples, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> as a descendant of Japheth. It is generally located in the area of modern-day Turkey or the southern part of Russia. The mention of Meshech symbolizes living among foreign, possibly hostile, peoples who do not share the psalmist's values or faith. This can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's experience in a world that is often at odds with God's ways.<p><b>that I live among the tents of Kedar!</b><br>Kedar refers to a nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, as noted in <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>. They were known for their tent-dwelling lifestyle in the Arabian desert. The tents of Kedar symbolize a transient, unsettled life among people who may be seen as adversaries or those who do not follow the God of Israel. This phrase highlights the psalmist's feeling of alienation and longing for a spiritual home. The imagery of tents suggests impermanence and a lack of stability, echoing the believer's journey through a world that is not their ultimate home (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/meshech.htm">Meshech</a></b><br>A region often associated with distant lands and peoples, possibly located in modern-day Turkey or Russia.

This sense of alienation can remind us of our true citizenship in heaven.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_cultural_differences.htm">The Challenge of Cultural Differences</a></b><br>The psalmist's lament highlights the difficulty of living among those with different beliefs and practices.

Prayer and reliance on God are crucial in such times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>Feeling isolated like the psalmist can drive us to seek fellowship with other believers.

The psalmist&#8217;s &#8220;woe&#8221; is both a literal acknowledgment of his environment and a timeless picture of every believer&#8217;s pilgrimage through a fallen culture. We grieve the sin around us, resist its pull, and wait eagerly for the day our dwelling will be with the Lord in perfect peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/120.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Mesech.</span>--This name is generally identified with <span class= "ital">Moschi, </span>mentioned by Herodotus (iii. 94), a tribe on the borders of Colchis and Armenia. It appears again in the prophet <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:">Ezekiel 38:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-1.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:">Ezekiel 39:1</a>. The only reason for suspecting the accuracy of this identification is the remoteness from <span class= "ital">Kedar, </span>who were a nomad tribe of Arabia. (See <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>.) But in the absence of any other indication of the motive for the mention of these tribes here, this very remoteness affords a sufficiently plausible one; or they may be types of savage life, selected the one from the north, and the other from the south, as poetry dictated. It is quite possible that the circumstances amid which the poet wrote made it necessary for him to veil in this way his allusion to powerful tribes, from whose violence the nation was suffering. At all events, the two concluding verses leave no doubt that some troubled state of affairs, in which the choice of courses was not easy, and affecting the whole nation. not an individual, is here presented.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/120.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech</span>.
