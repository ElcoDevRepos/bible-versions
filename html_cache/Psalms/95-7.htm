In the Old Testament, God established a covenant with Israel, declaring Himself as their God (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This relationship is characterized by God's faithfulness and the people's worship and obedience. The declaration "our God" signifies a personal and communal bond, reflecting the intimate relationship believers have with God through faith.<p><b>and we are the people of His pasture</b><br>The imagery of a pasture suggests provision, care, and sustenance. In ancient Israel, shepherding was a common occupation, and the metaphor of God as a shepherd is prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a>). This phrase indicates that believers are under God's protection and guidance, much like sheep are cared for by a shepherd. It underscores the idea of belonging and being nurtured by God.<p><b>the sheep under His care</b><br>Sheep are often used in the Bible to symbolize God's people, highlighting their need for guidance and protection. This phrase reinforces the shepherd-sheep relationship, where God is the shepherd who leads, protects, and provides for His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>). It also implies trust and dependence on God, as sheep rely on their shepherd for safety and sustenance.<p><b>Today, if you hear His voice</b><br>This phrase serves as an urgent call to obedience and responsiveness to God's guidance. The word "Today" emphasizes the immediacy and importance of responding to God without delay. Hearing God's voice implies being attentive to His word and commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>. This call to action is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to listen and respond to God's voice through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the shepherd and caretaker of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_his_pasture.htm">People of His Pasture</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, and by extension, all believers who are under God's guidance and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who follow and depend on God for sustenance and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_of_god.htm">Voice of God</a></b><br>Represents God's communication and guidance to His people, urging them to listen and obey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/today.htm">Today</a></b><br>Emphasizes the immediacy and urgency of responding to God's call.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_our_shepherd.htm">God as Our Shepherd</a></b><br>Recognize God's role as our shepherd, providing guidance, protection, and care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/our_identity_as_his_people.htm">Our Identity as His People</a></b><br>Embrace our identity as the people of His pasture, living under His care and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god's_voice.htm">Listening to God's Voice</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart that is attentive and responsive to God's voice, avoiding spiritual complacency.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_today.htm">The Urgency of Today</a></b><br>Understand the importance of responding to God "today," emphasizing the immediacy of obedience and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Acknowledge our dependence on God for spiritual nourishment and direction, much like sheep rely on their shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_95_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 95:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_95_7_inspire_us_today.htm">How does Psalm 95:7 encourage us to listen to God's voice today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_His_pasture_signify.htm">What does "we are the people of His pasture" signify about our relationship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_obey_Psalm_95_7_s_call.htm">How can we apply the call to obedience in Psalm 95:7 daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_texts_on_hearing_God_s_voice.htm">Which other scriptures emphasize the importance of hearing God's voice?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_as_shepherd_on_faith.htm">How does recognizing God as our shepherd impact our faith and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_95_7_Our_bond_with_God_as_His_flock.htm">How does Psalm 95:7 define our relationship with God as His people and sheep?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_95_7_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Psalm 95:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_95_7_s_impact_on_guidance_obedience.htm">How does Psalm 95:7 challenge our understanding of divine guidance and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_95.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 95?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_95_7-11_align_with_god's_mercy.htm">If Psalm 95:7&#8211;11 portrays God&#8217;s long-term wrath on an entire generation, how does that reconcile with passages emphasizing God&#8217;s mercy (e.g., Exodus 34:6)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_monitoring_spirit.htm">Who can take them from my Father's hand?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'naked_and_not_ashamed'_mean.htm">What does 'My sheep hear My voice' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_can_take_them_from_god.htm">Who can take them from my Father's hand?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 95:7 Mean</div><b>For He is our God</b><p>&#8211; The verse opens with a confident declaration of belonging.

The Masoretic text connects it with the preceding part of the verse, and there seems no good reason for departing from that arrangement. Indeed, the change from the third person, "his voice," to the first, "tempted me," in the same sentence is intolerable even in Hebrew poetry. Nor is there any necessity to suppose the loss of a line. Render: "For He is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep of his hand. Today would that ye would hearken to his voice." The Oriental custom of leading flocks by the voice is doubtless alluded to, as in <a href="/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>.
