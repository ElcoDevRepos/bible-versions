In the ancient Near East, each nation had its own pantheon of gods, often represented by physical idols. These idols were central to the religious and cultural identity of these nations. The Bible frequently contrasts the living God of Israel with the lifeless idols of other nations (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). This distinction underscores the uniqueness of Israel's monotheistic faith in a polytheistic world.<p><b>are silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold were valuable materials in the ancient world, often used to craft idols, signifying wealth and status. The use of precious metals for idols is mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>. These metals were not only chosen for their beauty and value but also for their durability. However, the Bible emphasizes that despite their material worth, these idols are powerless and cannot compare to the living God (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>).<p><b>made by the hands of men</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the human origin of idols, contrasting them with the divine creation of the universe by God. The act of crafting idols is depicted as futile and foolish in the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-17</a>, where the same materials used for idols are also used for mundane purposes. This highlights the absurdity of worshiping something man-made. The Bible consistently teaches that God is the Creator, not a creation, and thus worthy of worship (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various peoples and cultures surrounding Israel, often characterized by their worship of idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made from materials like silver and gold, representing false gods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hands_of_men.htm">Hands of Men</a></b><br>Indicates the human origin of these idols, emphasizing their man-made nature and lack of divine power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, though made of precious materials, are powerless and cannot compare to the living God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_creator_vs._the_created.htm">The Creator vs. the Created</a></b><br>Worship should be directed to the Creator, not the creations of human hands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/modern_idolatry.htm">Modern Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry today may not involve physical idols but can include anything that takes precedence over God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognizing God&#8217;s ultimate authority and power over all nations and their idols.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_worship.htm">Call to Worship</a></b><br>Encouragement to worship God in spirit and truth, avoiding the distractions of modern-day idols.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_135_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 135:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_135_15_s_view_on_modern_idols.htm">How does Psalm 135:15 challenge our understanding of modern-day idols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_135_15_say_about_idols.htm">What does Psalm 135:15 reveal about the nature of man-made idols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_135_15_reveal_our_idols.htm">How can Psalm 135:15 guide us in identifying idols in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_135_15_Exodus_20_3-4_on_idols.htm">Connect Psalm 135:15 with Exodus 20:3-4 on the prohibition of idolatry.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Psalm_135_15_to_value_God_first.htm">How can we apply Psalm 135:15 to prioritize God over worldly possessions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_135_15_Idols_nature_in_Bible_times.htm">What does Psalm 135:15 reveal about the nature of idols in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_135_15_vs_modern_idol_worship.htm">How does Psalm 135:15 challenge the worship of material objects today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_highlight_idols_futility_in_Psalm_135_15.htm">Why does Psalm 135:15 emphasize the futility of man-made idols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_135.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 135?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_address_ancient_belief_in_idols.htm">Psalm 135:15&#8211;18 dismisses idols as mere human constructs&#8212;how do we address ancient records and artifacts that suggest widespread and longstanding belief in these deities?

You shall not make for yourself an idol&#8230;&#8221;. The psalmist echoes this covenant demand, contrasting nations that craft gods with the God who crafts nations.<p>- <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> expands on the futility: idols have mouths that cannot speak and eyes that cannot see. The same wording there (&#8220;Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men&#8221;) links the two psalms, reinforcing the theme that idolatry is universal outside the covenant community.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a> paints the cultural picture: people cut a tree, adorn it with silver and gold, and then bow down to what they just assembled. <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a> therefore serves as a concise indictment of human-made worship objects adopted by &#8220;the nations,&#8221; that is, all people groups who do not know the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are silver and gold</b><p>- Precious metals signal value and allure, yet value does not equal divinity. <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a> warns that &#8220;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8221;; idolatry often begins with misdirected desire for what glitters.<p>- <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> tells believers to store treasure in heaven, not on earth. Even the finest silver and gold fail the ultimate durability test.<p>- <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a> asks, &#8220;What value is an idol carved by a craftsman&#8230;? It teaches lies&#8221;. The point: beauty and expense cannot compensate for lifelessness.<p>- Thus the psalm underscores irony: nations pour their wealth into objects that have no wealth of spirit, while the true God offers eternal riches freely (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>made by the hands of men</b><p>- The phrase exposes the core problem&#8212;humanity creating its own objects of worship. <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-20</a> offers a vivid scene: a craftsman cuts down a tree, uses half for firewood, then fashions the rest into a god and prays to it.<p>- <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24-25</a> affirms the opposite truth: &#8220;The God who made the world and everything in it&#8230; does not live in temples made by human hands. Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed anything&#8221;.<p>- <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a> laments that people &#8220;did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood&#8221;. The phrase &#8220;works of their hands&#8221; mirrors <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>, showing the persistent human inclination to craft gods rather than submit to the Creator.<p>- <a href="/bsb/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a>&#8217;s wording highlights the total dependence of idols on human effort: if people stop carving, melting, polishing, the idols cease to exist. In sharp contrast, the LORD existed before creation and sustains all things without human assistance (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a> exposes idolatry in three swift strokes: the objects are embraced by the nations, adorned with costly metals, and fashioned by human hands. Together these phrases declare that anything worshipped apart from the living God is powerless, no matter how widespread, expensive, or skillfully crafted. Believers are therefore called to reserve allegiance for the Creator alone, trusting Him rather than the glittering but lifeless products of human ingenuity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/135.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) With slight variations from <a href="/context/psalms/115-4.htm" title="Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.">Psalm 115:4-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/135.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
