In the context of ancient Israel, "His dwelling place" refers to the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem, which were considered the earthly abodes of God's presence. The tabernacle, described in detail in Exodus, was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wanderings in the desert. The temple, built by Solomon, became the permanent dwelling place of God in Jerusalem. This call to go to God's dwelling place emphasizes the importance of communal worship and pilgrimage, a practice deeply rooted in Jewish tradition. Theologically, it signifies a desire to be near God, to seek His presence, and to experience His glory. This longing for God's presence is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84:1-2</a>, which expresses a deep yearning for the courts of the Lord.<p><b>let us worship at His footstool.</b><br>The term "footstool" is a metaphorical expression for the earth or a specific place where God's presence is manifest. In the context of the temple, the Ark of the Covenant is often referred to as God's footstool (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>), symbolizing His throne on earth. Worshiping at His footstool implies a posture of humility and reverence, acknowledging God's sovereignty and majesty. This phrase underscores the act of worship as an expression of submission and adoration. In the broader biblical narrative, the concept of God's footstool is also found in <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where heaven is described as God's throne and the earth as His footstool, highlighting the transcendence and immanence of God. In the New Testament, this imagery is fulfilled in Christ, who is exalted above all, and believers are invited to approach Him with reverence and awe (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of many Psalms, including <a href="/bsb/psalms/132.htm">Psalm 132</a>, which is a part of the Songs of Ascents.
