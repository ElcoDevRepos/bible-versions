The Bible often emphasizes the power of words, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>, which states that "death and life are in the power of the tongue." The wickedness and deceitfulness of speech reflect a heart that is not aligned with God's truth, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." The deceitful nature of the words suggests a deliberate intention to mislead, reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that contrasts the truth of God with the lies of the enemy.<p><b>he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a departure from wisdom and righteousness. Biblically, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), suggesting that turning away from God leads to a loss of true wisdom. The cessation of well-doing implies a moral decline, where actions no longer reflect God's standards of righteousness. This mirrors the condition described in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>, where those who reject God become futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts are darkened. The phrase also echoes the warnings in the book of Proverbs about the consequences of forsaking wisdom and righteousness, leading to a path of destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/36.htm">Psalm 36</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

It is an awful picture of wickedness of a man abandoning himself without check or remorse to the inspiration of his own evil heart. He goes from bad to worse. In a great English tragedy, the murderer, though he has determined to wade farther in blood, yet prays against the horror of nightly temptations:<p>"Merciful powers,<p>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature<p>Gives way to in repose.<p>But this man "deviseth mischief upon his bed." When even the worst criminals shudder at their own deeds, whispering to their "deaf pillows" the agonies that creep over them with darkness and silence, this ungodly man of the Hebrew poet's picture is occupied rather in scheming fresh villainies; even then <span class= "ital">he abhorreth not evil, </span>or better, <span class= "ital">rejecteth not, </span>catches rather at every fresh suggestion, and shapes it to his end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of his mouth are iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">and deceit</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath left off to be wise, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">to do good.</span> There was a time when he occasionally acted wisely, and did what was right.
