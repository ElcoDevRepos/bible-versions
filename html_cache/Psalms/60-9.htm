The "fortified city" likely refers to a city with significant defenses, possibly symbolizing a place of great challenge or opposition. In the historical context, fortified cities were common in ancient Near Eastern warfare, serving as strategic military and political centers. The psalmist's question implies a reliance on God for guidance and strength, acknowledging that human efforts alone are insufficient. This reliance on divine intervention is a recurring theme in the Psalms, emphasizing trust in God's sovereignty and power. The fortified city can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual battles, where believers seek God's help to overcome sin and temptation.<p><b>Who will lead me to Edom?</b><br>Edom, located southeast of Israel, was historically an adversary of Israel. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and their relationship with Israel was often marked by conflict. The mention of Edom here may symbolize a formidable enemy or a significant challenge that the psalmist faces. In biblical history, Edom was known for its rugged terrain and strong defenses, making it a difficult region to conquer. The question "Who will lead me" underscores the need for divine guidance and leadership in overcoming such obstacles. This reflects a broader biblical theme of God as the ultimate leader and deliverer of His people. The reference to Edom can also be seen as a type of Christ's victory over all spiritual enemies, as Christ leads believers to triumph over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often sought God's guidance and strength in battles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_city.htm">Fortified City</a></b><br>Represents a place of strength and security, often seen as a military stronghold.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation located to the southeast of Israel, often in conflict with Israel.

By asking, &#8220;Who will bring me,&#8221; David openly admits that even a seasoned king cannot reach victory on his own. He looks beyond human strategy to divine initiative, echoing earlier confessions such as &#8220;You are my King, O God; ordain victories for Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The question is not rhetorical despair but a faith-based appeal.<p>&#8226; It reminds us that &#8220;the horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Every believer today is invited to echo this dependence: our battles&#8212;spiritual, relational, cultural&#8212;require the same divine escort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the fortified city?</b><p>The &#8220;fortified city&#8221; points to Edom&#8217;s mountain stronghold with its high cliffs and narrow passes (compare <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>). Humanly speaking, it was nearly impregnable. David singles it out to underline how impossible the task is without God.<p>&#8226; By naming the toughest objective first, he highlights the greatness of God&#8217;s power when the walls look highest (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds Israel of past victories where God overcame formidable defenses, such as Jericho (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the fortified city symbolizes any entrenched obstacle&#8212;addictions, cultural strongholds, ideological fortresses&#8212;that only God can penetrate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will lead me</b><p>Leadership here stresses guidance, not merely transport. David longs for God to chart the course, just as He had done through the wilderness by cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>) shows this ongoing plea in David&#8217;s prayers.<p>&#8226; Godly leadership provides wisdom for timing, tactics, and perseverance (<a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers find this leadership fulfilled in Christ, who says, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Edom?</b><p>Edom had long opposed Israel, celebrating Judah&#8217;s calamities (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10&#8211;14</a>).

The questions expose human limitation while expressing confident expectation that the Lord Himself will bring, lead, and conquer. Our modern walls may differ, but the answer is unchanged: &#8220;Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/124-8.htm">Psalm 124:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/60.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Who will . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>how can this ancient Divine oracle be fulfilled now in present circumstances? This is the poet's question. He may be a king himself eager for triumph, or more probably Israel personified. (See the plural in <a href="/context/psalms/60-10.htm" title="Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?">Psalm 60:10-12</a>.) Edom is the particular foe in view, and as the difficulties of the undertaking present themselves, misgivings arise and the assurance gained from the triumphs of olden time turns into prayer, half plaintive, half confident, that the Divine favour and power may be once more on the side of the chosen people.<p><span class= "bld">The strong city.</span>--As in the Hebrew the article is wanting, any strongly fortified city might be intended, were it not for the parallelism. Here it must stand for <span class= "ital">Selah </span>or <span class= "ital">Petra, </span>the capital of Edom. For its impregnable position (see Note <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm" title="The pride of your heart has deceived you, you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that said in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?">Obadiah 1:3</a>). The question, "Who will lead me into Petra?" is explained by the fact that there are only two possible approaches to the city, each a long narrow tortuous defile, and that the place itself is so buried in its ravines that it cannot be seen from any spot in its neighbourhood far or near.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9-12.</span> - Rehearsal of God's promises has raised the psalmist out of despondency, and he can now confidently call God to his assistance. Edom is to be conquered, for so God has premised (ver. 8). But how? Who will lead out Israel's armies? Will God, who has lately "cast Israel off"? If not, it must he man. But "vain is the help of man" (ver. 11). So the call is made that God will give help in the trouble - and with the call comes full confidence - and the triumphant cry goes forth, "Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will bring me into the strong city?</span> The "strong city" of Edom was Sela, "The Cliff" - now Petra.
