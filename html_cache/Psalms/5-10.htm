In biblical context, the concept of divine judgment is prevalent, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares vengeance and recompense. The psalmist's call for God to declare the wicked guilty aligns with the understanding that God is the ultimate judge, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, where Abraham acknowledges God as the judge of all the earth.<p><b>let them fall by their own devices.</b><br>This phrase suggests that the wicked will be ensnared by their own schemes, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, which warns that those who dig a pit will fall into it. The idea of reaping what one sows is a common biblical principle, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The psalmist's request reflects a belief in the moral order of the universe, where evil ultimately leads to self-destruction.<p><b>Drive them out for their many transgressions,</b><br>Here, the psalmist asks for the removal of the wicked due to their numerous sins. This reflects the biblical theme of separation between the righteous and the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4-6</a>. The concept of being "driven out" can also be connected to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>) due to their transgression, highlighting the consequences of sin.<p><b>for they have rebelled against You.</b><br>Rebellion against God is a serious offense in the biblical narrative, often leading to divine judgment. This phrase underscores the personal nature of sin as an affront to God Himself, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, where rebellion is likened to the sin of divination. The psalmist's emphasis on rebellion highlights the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience is expected, and rebellion leads to separation from God's favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of the Psalm, who is seeking God's justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The righteous judge whom David appeals to for justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>- Those who are guilty of transgressions and rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>- The act of defying God, which is central to the plea for divine justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgressions.htm">Transgressions</a></b><br>- The sins and wrongdoings of the enemies, which are the basis for David's plea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_is_righteous.htm">God's Justice is Righteous</a></b><br>God is a righteous judge who will not let sin go unpunished.

The verse reminds believers that God judges sin righteously, allows evil to boomerang on itself, protects His people by separating unrepentant wrongdoers, and always views rebellion as ultimately against Him. Living in that confidence frees us to pursue holiness and leave vengeance to the One who judges justly (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Destroy.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make </span>or <span class= "ital">count guilty.</span><p><span class= "bld">Transgressions.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">revolts, </span>thus being in close synonymous parallelism with the next clause.
