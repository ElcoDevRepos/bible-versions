In biblical context, this can be seen as a divine intervention where God instills fear in the hearts of the wicked, similar to the panic that struck the enemies of Israel in various battles (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6-7</a>). Historically, this reflects the psychological warfare God often used against Israel's enemies, causing them to flee without a physical threat. This can also be connected to the spiritual truth that those who reject God live in constant fear, as they lack the peace that comes from faith in Him (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>).<p><b>For God has scattered the bones of those who besieged you.</b><br>This imagery of scattered bones signifies complete defeat and disgrace. In ancient Near Eastern culture, leaving bones unburied was a sign of utter humiliation and divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/8.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>). This phrase may allude to the fate of the Assyrian army in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>, where God miraculously delivered Jerusalem by striking down the besieging forces. It underscores God's power to protect His people and defeat their enemies, serving as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>You put them to shame, for God has despised them.</b><br>The shame of the enemies is a result of God's active disdain for those who oppose His will. This reflects the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Theologically, it emphasizes God's justice and the eventual downfall of the wicked, as seen in the fate of nations and individuals who defied Him throughout Scripture (e.g., Pharaoh in Exodus, Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>). This also foreshadows the final judgment where Christ will triumph over all His enemies, bringing shame to those who rejected Him (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the protector and defender of His people, scattering the bones of their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemies.htm">The Enemies</a></b><br>Those who besiege God's people, ultimately put to shame and despised by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_god.htm">The People of God</a></b><br>The recipients of God's protection and deliverance, witnessing the defeat of their adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all circumstances, and His protection is assured for those who trust in Him.

First, the wicked are seized by dread that springs from their own guilt. Second, God visibly crushes their assault, scattering their remains as proof of His defense. Finally, He exposes and shames them, demonstrating His steadfast commitment to His people. The verse reassures us that true security rests not in circumstances but in the Lord who judges evil, protects His own, and turns every threat into testimony of His covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/53.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Where no fear was.</span>--This--the most interesting variation from Psalms 14--appears plainly to have been inserted to bring the Psalm into harmony with some circumstance belonging to the time for which it was adapted, but to which we have no clue. As to the choice among the various explanations that have been given of it, we must remark that the one which takes "fear" in a good sense ("Then were they in great fright where there was no fear of God") is excluded by the fact that the same word is employed in both clauses; and, as elsewhere <span class= "ital">p?chad </span>is used of a "cause of terror," we may render, <span class= "ital">There were they in great fear, where there was no cause for fear.</span><p>Apparently, from the immediate context, this statement is made not of the enemies of Israel, but of Israel itself, and was so constantly applicable to a people supposed to be living under the immediate protection of God, and yet liable to sudden panics, that we need not try to recover the precise event referred to.<p><span class= "bld">Of him that encampeth against thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of thy besiegers. </span>The bones of the beleaguering host lie bleaching on the sand. But the text seems to have suffered. The LXX. and Vulg. have "the bones of them that please men," and a comparison with <a href="/context/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5-6</a> shows such a similarity of <span class= "ital">letters, </span>with difference of <span class= "ital">meaning, </span>that both texts look like different attempts to restore some faded MS. Many attempts have been made to restore the original, but none eminently satisfactory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were they in great fear, where no fear was</span>. So long a phrase as "where no fear was" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;</span>) can scarcely have "fallen out," and must have been added intentionally to mark that, on the occasion in connection with which the revision was made, there had been no ground at all for the panic. <span class="cmt_word">For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee</span>. This clause takes the place of the following in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>.: "For God is in the generation of the righteous" - a very considerable change, which must certainly have been intentional. On the second occasion whereto the psalm was made applicable, there must have been a very great catastrophe - some vast slaughter of an enemy who had been at open war with Israel. Sennacherib is suggested (Canon Cook). Thou hast put them to shams, because God hath despised them. The clause in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. which this replaces runs as follows: "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his Refuge." Here again, both the phrases used, and the whole tenor of the thought in either case, are different. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/53-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There they are,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;
