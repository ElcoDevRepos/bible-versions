These signs, known as the ten plagues, were divine judgments against Egypt's idolatry and oppression of the Israelites. Each plague targeted specific Egyptian deities, showcasing the Lord's supremacy. The plagues included turning the Nile to blood, frogs, gnats, flies, livestock disease, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and the death of the firstborn. These acts were not only punitive but also redemptive, as they led to the liberation of the Israelites, prefiguring Christ's redemptive work to free humanity from sin.<p><b>and His wonders in the fields of Zoan</b><br>Zoan, also known as Tanis, was an ancient city in the northeastern Nile Delta, serving as a significant administrative center during the time of the Exodus. The mention of Zoan highlights the historical and geographical context of the plagues, grounding these miraculous events in a real location known for its political importance. The wonders performed in Zoan were a direct challenge to the heart of Egyptian power and culture. This phrase emphasizes God's intervention in human history, demonstrating His ability to work within specific cultural and historical contexts to achieve His purposes. The wonders in Zoan also foreshadow the greater wonders of Christ's ministry, where He performed miracles to reveal God's kingdom and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one performing signs and wonders, demonstrating His power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, and where God performed miraculous signs to secure their release.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zoan.htm">Zoan</a></b><br>An ancient city in Egypt, known for its significance during the time of the Exodus.

God chose that very arena to display superior wonders (<a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>).<p>- By specifying &#8220;fields,&#8221; the psalmist widens the stage&#8212;from palace halls to everyday life. Everywhere the plagues struck, God&#8217;s wonders were unmistakable (<a href="/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16&#8211;24</a>).<p>- The contrast is sharp: fertile fields turned to wastelands under hail and locusts (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23&#8211;25</a>; 10:13&#8211;15). What Egypt relied on for sustenance, God disrupted to show that He alone sustains (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27&#8211;30</a>).<p>- These wonders served a covenant purpose: to establish Israel as God&#8217;s redeemed people and to proclaim His name among the nations (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p>- For Christians, Zoan&#8217;s fields remind us that God often works in the ordinary places of life, confronting idols and proving His sufficiency (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-43.htm">Psalm 78:43</a> celebrates God&#8217;s literal, historical plagues&#8212;signs in Egypt, wonders in Zoan&#8212;that freed Israel and revealed His unmatched authority.
