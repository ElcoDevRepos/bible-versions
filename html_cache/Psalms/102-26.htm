The "they" refers to the heavens and the earth, as mentioned in the preceding verses. This highlights the transient nature of the physical world, which is subject to decay and destruction. In contrast, God is eternal and unchanging, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). This distinction underscores God's sovereignty and the assurance that His promises and purposes endure beyond the physical universe.<p><b>they will all wear out like a garment.</b><br>The imagery of a garment wearing out is a metaphor for the inevitable decline and aging of the created order. In ancient times, garments were valuable but also subject to wear and tear, symbolizing the temporary nature of material things. This metaphor is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, where the heavens and the earth are described as wearing out like a garment, emphasizing the contrast between the perishable creation and the imperishable Creator. This serves as a reminder of the futility of placing ultimate trust in the material world.<p><b>Like clothing You will change them,</b><br>This phrase suggests God's active role in the transformation and renewal of creation. The act of changing clothing implies a deliberate and controlled process, indicating God's sovereignty over the universe. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the new creation promised in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where a new heaven and a new earth replace the old. It also reflects the biblical theme of renewal and restoration, where God brings about a new order in His timing and according to His will.<p><b>and they will be passed on.</b><br>The idea of being "passed on" suggests a transition or succession, indicating that the current creation will give way to something new. This aligns with the eschatological hope found in the New Testament, where believers anticipate the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan and the establishment of His eternal kingdom. The passing of the old order makes way for the new, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>, where the heavens and earth are described as being dissolved to make way for a new creation. This phrase reassures believers of the ultimate renewal and restoration that God will bring about.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>, traditionally believed to be David, is expressing a deep lament and seeking God's eternal presence amidst the temporal nature of creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The eternal and unchanging Creator, contrasted with the perishable nature of the created world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>Refers to the heavens and the earth, which are described as perishable and transient, like a garment that wears out.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_creation.htm">The Transience of Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that the physical world is temporary and will eventually pass away.
