The "fiery furnace" is reminiscent of the furnace in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, where Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown but not consumed, symbolizing God's protection over the faithful and His power over judgment. The "time of Your appearing" suggests an eschatological event, pointing to the Day of the Lord, a time of reckoning and fulfillment of divine justice. This aligns with New Testament themes in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-8</a>, where Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire, dealing out retribution. The furnace symbolizes both judgment and purification, a common biblical motif where fire refines and purifies (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>In His wrath the LORD will engulf them,</b><br>The wrath of the LORD is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, representing His righteous anger against sin and injustice. This phrase underscores the seriousness of divine judgment. The engulfing nature of God's wrath can be seen in historical events such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12), where God's power and judgment were visibly demonstrated. Theologically, this reflects God's holiness and justice, which cannot tolerate sin. It also serves as a warning to the unrepentant, emphasizing the need for repentance and faithfulness.<p><b>and the fire will consume them.</b><br>Fire as a consuming force is a powerful biblical image of judgment. In the Old Testament, fire often signifies God's presence and judgment, as seen in the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). The consuming fire represents total destruction of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>, where the LORD comes with fire to execute judgment. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where eternal fire is a metaphor for final judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>). The consuming nature of fire highlights the completeness of God's judgment, leaving nothing unaddressed. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's authority and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's power and justice.

Severe suffering is continually compared in Scripture to confinement in an oven or furnace (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18, 20, 22</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>).
