The trembling of the earth at God's gaze can be seen as a metaphor for His authority and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence. In biblical context, the earth trembling is often associated with divine intervention or judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where Mount Sinai trembles when God descends upon it. This imagery underscores the idea that the natural world responds to its Creator, highlighting God's omnipotence. The trembling can also be seen as a reminder of the fear of the Lord, a recurring theme in Scripture that calls for reverence and awe towards God.<p><b>He touches the mountains, and they smolder.</b><br>The imagery of mountains smoldering at God's touch further illustrates His immense power and control over nature. This can be connected to the theophany at Mount Sinai, where God's presence is accompanied by smoke and fire (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize stability and permanence, yet here they are depicted as being easily affected by God's touch, indicating that even the most enduring elements of creation are subject to His will. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the New Testament, is described as having authority over nature, as demonstrated in miracles such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). The smoldering mountains may also allude to the refining and purifying nature of God's presence, which consumes impurities and brings about transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as having sovereign power over the earth and its natural elements.
