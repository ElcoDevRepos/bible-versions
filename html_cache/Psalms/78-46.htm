In the biblical context, grasshoppers and locusts are often used as instruments of God's judgment, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>). The grasshopper, a smaller relative of the locust, symbolizes destruction and loss. This judgment serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God&#8217;s covenant. The imagery of crops being devoured is a powerful representation of economic and sustenance loss, which would have been devastating in an agrarian society dependent on harvests for survival.<p><b>the fruit of their labor to the locust</b><br>The locust is a more formidable and destructive force than the grasshopper, often associated with widespread devastation. In the ancient Near East, locust swarms could obliterate entire fields, leading to famine and hardship. This phrase emphasizes the totality of the destruction, as the "fruit of their labor" signifies the hard work and toil of the people being rendered futile. The locusts consuming the fruit of their labor can be seen as a fulfillment of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural failure. This also serves as a typology of divine retribution, where God uses natural elements to execute His will. The locust plague is a precursor to the ultimate judgment and a call to repentance, echoing the prophetic warnings found in <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>, where locusts are used as symbols of divine wrath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His sovereignty and judgment over the natural world and human affairs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The implied location where these events took place, as <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> recounts the plagues God sent upon Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were enslaved in Egypt and witnessed these miraculous events as part of their deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grasshopper_and_locust.htm">Grasshopper and Locust</a></b><br>Insects used by God as instruments of judgment against Egypt, representing His control over creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crops_and_fruit_of_labor.htm">Crops and Fruit of Labor</a></b><br>The agricultural produce of Egypt, which was destroyed as part of the plagues, symbolizing the futility of human effort against divine will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>This verse reminds us that God is in control of all creation, using even the smallest creatures to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_deliverance.htm">Judgment and Deliverance</a></b><br>The plagues, including the locusts, were both acts of judgment against Egypt and steps toward the deliverance of Israel, illustrating God's dual role as judge and savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_effort_against_god.htm">The Futility of Human Effort Against God</a></b><br>The destruction of crops signifies the futility of relying solely on human labor and resources when opposed to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Just as the Egyptians faced consequences for their actions, we are reminded to examine our lives and turn back to God in areas where we may be resisting His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>While the Egyptians' resources were destroyed, God provided for the Israelites, teaching us to trust in His provision even in times of scarcity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_46_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_46_God_s_power_in_nature.htm">How does Psalm 78:46 illustrate God's power over nature and creation?
