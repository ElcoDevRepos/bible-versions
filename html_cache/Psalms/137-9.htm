In the context of the Psalms, blessings often reflect divine justice or retribution. The use of "blessed" here is ironic and reflects the deep emotional pain and desire for justice felt by the Israelites during their Babylonian exile. It echoes the covenantal promises where blessings and curses are pronounced based on obedience or disobedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>who seizes your infants</b><br>The mention of "infants" highlights the severity and totality of the judgment being called for. In ancient warfare, the destruction of the next generation was a way to ensure the complete downfall of a nation. This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian conquest, where the Israelites experienced the brutal destruction of Jerusalem and the loss of their own children. The phrase is a cry for justice, mirroring the atrocities they suffered, and is reminiscent of the prophecy against Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, where similar language is used to describe the fate of Babylon's children.<p><b>and dashes them against the rocks.</b><br>This graphic imagery underscores the intensity of the psalmist's lament and desire for retribution. In the ancient Near East, such acts were not uncommon in warfare, symbolizing the utter defeat and humiliation of an enemy. The rocks may symbolize the harsh and unyielding nature of divine justice. This phrase can be seen as a call for God to enact justice against Babylon, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>, where God promises to repay Babylon for its deeds. While difficult to reconcile with modern sensibilities, this reflects the raw human emotion and the longing for divine justice in the face of profound suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire responsible for the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Israelites.

The psalmist, under the inspiration of the Spirit, pronounces a genuine blessing on the instrument of God&#8217;s justice.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents God as righteous Judge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) and assures the faithful that evil will not go unanswered (<a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; In imprecatory passages, the blessing rests on alignment with God&#8217;s judgment, not on private vengeance (<a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist&#8217;s faith affirms: when justice is finally served, it is right to call the agent of that justice &#8220;blessed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who seizes</b><p>&#8226; The verb pictures deliberate, forceful action. This is not a random outburst but the purposeful carrying out of divine retribution.<p>&#8226; God had foretold Babylon&#8217;s fall through the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24, 56</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6&#8211;9</a>). Those who would &#8220;seize&#8221; Babylon&#8217;s little ones are the armies raised by the Lord to repay Babylon for its cruelty (<a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist therefore looks ahead to the day when the Lord appoints a conquering force&#8212;eventually the Medes and Persians (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>)&#8212;to execute His sentence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your infants</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Your&#8221; points to Babylon, the captor nation that ravaged Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Infants represent the future of a people. By naming them, the psalmist underscores the completeness of the coming judgment: Babylon&#8217;s line, strength, and hope will be cut off (<a href="/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Babylon had shown no mercy to Judah&#8217;s children (<a href="/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>). Divine justice returns measure for measure (<a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and dashes them</b><p>&#8226; The action is violent because Babylon&#8217;s sin was violent. Scripture often uses mirrored retribution: what the wicked have done is done to them (<a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Such language conveys finality. No partial discipline, no temporary setback&#8212;Babylon will be shattered beyond recovery (<a href="/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63&#8211;64</a>).<p>&#8226; The severity reminds readers that God&#8217;s holiness does not tolerate unrepentant cruelty (<a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the rocks</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rocks&#8221; signify the hard, unavoidable reality of God&#8217;s verdict&#8212;something no one can soften or evade (<a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In antiquity, conquering armies literally smashed enemy infants to prevent future retaliation. The psalmist records this as the known form of total conquest (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even here, the passage is descriptive, not prescriptive for believers today. It reveals God&#8217;s right to repay; it does not license personal acts of violence (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38&#8211;39</a>; <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By fixing the scene &#8220;against the rocks,&#8221; Scripture paints an unmistakable picture: Babylon&#8217;s downfall will be public, irreversible, and precisely what it inflicted on others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/137-9.htm">Psalm 137:9</a> is an inspired, literal declaration that everyone aligned with God&#8217;s judgment on Babylon will be blessed, even though the judgment itself is fierce. The verse does not celebrate cruelty; it celebrates divine justice&#8212;justice that mirrors Babylon&#8217;s own atrocities and fulfills God&#8217;s prophetic word. Far from diminishing God&#8217;s love, the severity of this verse underscores His holiness, His faithfulness to His oppressed people, and His absolute commitment to make all wrongs right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/137.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Little ones.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">sucklings.</span><p><span class= "bld">Stones.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">cliff </span>or <span class= "ital">rock.</span><p>For this feature of barbarous cruelty with which ancient war was cursed see <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord?
