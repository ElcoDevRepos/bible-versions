In biblical times, trees were often seen as symbols of strength and stability. The phrase suggests that these trees are abundantly supplied by God, indicating His sovereignty over nature. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26-30</a>, where Jesus speaks of God's care for the birds and the lilies.<p><b>the cedars of Lebanon that He planted</b><br>Cedars of Lebanon were renowned for their size, strength, and durability, often used in ancient construction, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). These trees symbolize majesty and might, reflecting God's creative power. The mention of God planting them underscores His role as the ultimate Creator. The cedars are also a type of Christ, representing strength and eternal life, as seen in the imagery of the righteous flourishing like a cedar in <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>. The historical context of Lebanon's cedars being highly prized and traded throughout the ancient Near East adds to their significance in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of all things, who provides for His creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees_of_the_lord.htm">The Trees of the LORD</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's provision and care, representing strength and stability.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cedars_of_lebanon.htm">Cedars of Lebanon</a></b><br>Renowned for their strength, height, and durability, these trees were often used in ancient construction, including the temple built by Solomon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its majestic cedar trees, often associated with beauty and grandeur in biblical literature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a> celebrates God's creation and His ongoing care for it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_care.htm">God's Provision and Care</a></b><br>Just as God waters the trees, He provides for all of His creation, including us.
