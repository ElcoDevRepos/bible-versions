In biblical context, generosity is a virtue highly esteemed throughout Scripture. <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a> states, "A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, where acts of kindness and generosity lead to blessings. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on community and mutual support, where generosity was not just a personal virtue but a communal expectation. The phrase also echoes the character of God, who is described as generous and giving, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where God gives wisdom generously to all without finding fault.<p><b>and quick to lend</b><br>In ancient Israel, lending was often a necessity for those in need, and the Law provided guidelines to ensure fairness and compassion in these transactions (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a>). The willingness to lend without hesitation reflects a heart aligned with God's commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>, which instructs the Israelites to open their hands to the poor and needy. This phrase also connects to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>, where Jesus encourages lending without expecting anything in return, thus reflecting the selfless love of Christ. The act of lending in this context is not merely financial but also encompasses offering time, resources, and support to others.<p><b>and their children are a blessing</b><br>The blessing of children is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen as a sign of God's favor and a reward for righteousness (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). In the cultural and historical context of the Bible, children were considered a vital part of the family unit, contributing to the family's labor and legacy. The phrase suggests that the generosity and righteousness of the parents have a positive impact on their offspring, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>, which states, "The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them." This reflects the biblical principle that the actions and character of one generation can influence the blessings and prosperity of the next. The idea of children as a blessing also points to the future hope and continuation of God's promises through generations, ultimately fulfilled in the lineage of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, King David, is traditionally believed to have written this psalm.
