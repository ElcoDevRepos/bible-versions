This phrase suggests a plea for divine justice against the wicked, reflecting the psalmist's deep distress and desire for God's intervention. The "Book of Life" is mentioned in several other scriptures, such as <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>, where Moses intercedes for Israel, and <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>, which promises that the faithful will not be erased from this book. The idea of being "blotted out" implies a removal from God's favor and eternal blessing, highlighting the seriousness of divine judgment. This phrase underscores the belief in God's ultimate authority over life and death, and the eternal consequences of one's actions.<p><b>and not listed with the righteous.</b><br>The distinction between the wicked and the righteous is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and the broader biblical narrative. Being "listed with the righteous" implies inclusion among those who live according to God's will and are recipients of His promises. This phrase reflects the psalmist's desire for a clear demarcation between those who follow God and those who oppose Him. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, righteousness was closely associated with covenant faithfulness and adherence to the Law. This plea for separation from the righteous echoes other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>, which contrasts the way of the righteous with the way of the wicked. It also points to the eschatological hope found in the New Testament, where the righteous are promised eternal life with God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. This phrase emphasizes the importance of living a life aligned with God's standards and the ultimate hope of being counted among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing deep distress and calling for divine justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals or groups who oppose David, representing those who are unrighteous and opposed to God's anointed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/book_of_life.htm">Book of Life</a></b><br>A metaphorical book in which the names of the righteous are recorded, symbolizing eternal life and divine favor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are in right standing with God, often contrasted with the wicked throughout the Psalms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The event or process by which God evaluates and determines the fate of individuals based on their righteousness or wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_justice.htm">Understanding Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is perfect and righteous.

Earlier verses reveal relentless mockery and false accusation (vv. 4, 12). By verse 28 the king petitions God to act against enemies who persist in wickedness, echoing other imprecatory pleas (e.g., <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>). The request springs from:<p>&#8226; A zeal for God&#8217;s honor, not personal revenge (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>; <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Confidence that the Lord judges righteously (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The covenant reality that persistent rebels cannot dwell among God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May they be blotted out</b><p>To be &#8220;blotted out&#8221; pictures permanent removal, like erasing ink from a scroll.

The verse underscores divine justice, the reality of a heavenly registry of God&#8217;s people, and the final separation between those who belong to Him and those who do not. It invites believers to rest in God&#8217;s righteous judgment, cherish their secure place in Christ, and pursue holy living as those whose names are eternally recorded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/69.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Book of the living</span>--<span class= "bld">or life.</span>--This image, which plays so great a part in Christian poetry (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm" title="He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>.
