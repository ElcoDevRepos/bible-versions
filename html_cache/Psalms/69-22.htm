In biblical times, the table was a place of hospitality and blessing. The imagery of a table turning into a snare indicates a divine judgment where blessings are turned into curses. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9-10</a>, where Paul applies this verse to the spiritual blindness of Israel, showing how their privileges became a stumbling block. The table, often associated with abundance and God's provision, becomes a metaphor for the consequences of rejecting God's ways.<p><b>may it be a retribution</b><br>Retribution here implies a just recompense for actions taken. In the context of <a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is calling for divine justice against his enemies. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a righteous judge who repays individuals according to their deeds. The idea of retribution is consistent with the covenantal understanding of blessings and curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience leads to blessings and disobedience to curses. This phrase underscores the principle that actions have consequences, and divine justice will ultimately prevail.<p><b>and a trap.</b><br>The word "trap" suggests an unexpected and unavoidable consequence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, traps were often used for hunting, symbolizing sudden and inescapable capture. This imagery is used throughout the Psalms to describe the fate of the wicked (e.g., <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>). Theologically, it points to the idea that those who oppose God's anointed will find themselves ensnared by their own schemes. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where the rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders led to their spiritual downfall, fulfilling the prophetic nature of this psalm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and calling upon God for justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals or groups who oppose David and seek his harm, representing those who oppose God's anointed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and deliverer, whom David calls upon to enact justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often seen as the context for David's struggles, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_prophecy.htm">Messianic Prophecy</a></b><br>Psalm 69 is often seen as a prophetic psalm, with elements that are fulfilled in the life of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rejection.htm">The Consequences of Rejection</a></b><br>Just as David's enemies faced retribution, those who reject God's truth today may find their blessings turned into burdens.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>We can trust in God's perfect justice, knowing that He will ultimately vindicate His people and judge the wicked.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Like the enemies of David, those who are spiritually blind may not recognize the traps they set for themselves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understanding the messianic elements of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a> can deepen our appreciation for how the Old Testament points to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_deliverance.htm">Prayer for Deliverance</a></b><br>In times of distress, we can follow David's example by bringing our struggles to God and seeking His intervention.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_69_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 69:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_22_God_s_judgment_on_sinners.htm">How does Psalm 69:22 illustrate God's judgment on the unrepentant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_table_become_a_snare_in_Ps_69_22.htm">What does "table become a snare" mean in Psalm 69:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_22_Praying_for_truth_rejecters.htm">How can Psalm 69:22 guide our prayers for those rejecting God's truth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_passages_echo_Psalm_69_22_themes.htm">Which New Testament passages echo themes found in Psalm 69:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_22_s_role_in_addressing_blindness.htm">How should Psalm 69:22 influence our response to spiritual blindness in others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_snare_trap_in_Psalm_69_22.htm">What does Psalm 69:22 mean by "a snare" and "a trap" for enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_22_God_s_justice_and_wrath.htm">How does Psalm 69:22 reflect God's justice and wrath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Psalm_69_22_a_curse_prayer.htm">Why is Psalm 69:22 considered a curse or imprecatory prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_69.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 69?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalm_69_curses_fit_with_mercy.htm">Psalm 69:22&#8211;28 calls down curses on enemies&#8212;how does this fit with other biblical teachings on mercy and forgiveness (e.g., Matthew 5:44)?
