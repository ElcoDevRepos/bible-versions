In the ancient Near East, floods were a common threat due to the region's geography, with heavy rains causing rivers to overflow. Biblically, floods can represent God's judgment, as seen in the story of Noah (Genesis 6-9), where the floodwaters were a means of divine cleansing. The psalmist uses this imagery to convey a sense of peril that could have consumed the people if not for divine intervention. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a protector against overwhelming forces, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises to be with His people through waters and rivers.<p><b>then the torrent would have overwhelmed us</b><br>The term "torrent" suggests a powerful, rushing stream, emphasizing the intensity and suddenness of the threat. In biblical times, torrents could refer to seasonal streams that became dangerous during heavy rains. This imagery is used to describe situations that are beyond human control, requiring divine assistance. The psalmist's use of this metaphor highlights the vulnerability of humans in the face of natural and spiritual adversities. This aligns with other scriptural references where God delivers His people from overwhelming circumstances, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>, where God rescues from "mighty waters." The phrase also points to the New Testament, where Jesus calms the storm (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>), symbolizing His authority over chaos and His role as the ultimate deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/124.htm">Psalm 124</a>, David is expressing gratitude for God's deliverance from overwhelming threats.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation of Israel is the primary audience and subject of this Psalm, reflecting on God's protection over them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/floods_and_torrents.htm">Floods and Torrents</a></b><br>- Metaphorical imagery used to describe overwhelming dangers or adversities that could have destroyed Israel without God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance_in_overwhelming_circumstances.htm">God's Deliverance in Overwhelming Circumstances</a></b><br>Just as God delivered Israel from overwhelming threats, He is capable of delivering us from the overwhelming situations in our lives.

He is not exaggerating; Scripture describes literal floods that wiped out everything in their path (<a href="/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The line celebrates God&#8217;s past deliverance of Israel. Had the Lord not been on their side, those &#8220;floods&#8221; of enemy attack and calamity would have swallowed the nation whole, just as the Red Sea would have swallowed Israel if God had not parted it (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today can read this verse with the same confidence: whatever threatens to submerge us&#8212;persecution, cultural hostility, personal crisis&#8212;can go no further than God allows. <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a> promises, &#8220;When you pass through the waters, I will be with you&#8230; the rivers will not sweep over you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The language invites gratitude. Looking back over our lives, we can trace moments when disaster seemed certain, yet the Lord stepped in. <a href="/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1-3</a> echoes the feeling: &#8220;Save me, O God! For the waters are up to my neck.&#8221; He did then, and He still does now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then the torrent would have overwhelmed us</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;torrent&#8221; is a violent rush of water, stronger than ordinary floods. David intensifies the picture, underscoring how quickly God&#8217;s people could have been crushed without divine intervention. <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> uses the same imagery: &#8220;With an overwhelming flood He will make a complete end of the adversaries.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse teaches that worldly powers and spiritual foes are no match for the Lord. What feels unstoppable to us is effortlessly restrained by Him. When Jesus calmed the storm with a word (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), He demonstrated the same authority celebrated here.<p>&#8226; The double expression&#8212;flood, then torrent&#8212;shows escalating danger, highlighting God&#8217;s greater deliverance. <a href="/matthew/7-25.htm">Matthew 7:25</a> depicts a house that &#8220;did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock,&#8221; despite rain, rivers, and winds. Our security rests on the same Rock.<p>&#8226; For David, the &#8220;torrent&#8221; may have pointed to military forces surging like water (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). For us, it could be overwhelming grief, temptation, or societal upheaval. Still, <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a> rings true: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a> stacks two vivid water images&#8212;floods that would engulf and torrents that would overwhelm&#8212;to remind worshippers of the absolute peril we would face without the Lord&#8217;s saving intervention. The verse is a literal, historical acknowledgment of past rescues and a timeless promise that God continues to hold back every force poised to sweep His people away. Knowing this, we live in grateful confidence, standing firm on the unshakable faithfulness of our God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/124.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Waters.</span>--The sudden transition in the imagery from the earthquake to the flood is characteristic of Hebrew poetry.
