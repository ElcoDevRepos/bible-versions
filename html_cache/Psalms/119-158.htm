This sentiment reflects a deep commitment to God's law and a desire for righteousness. The term "faithless" often refers to those who have turned away from God's commandments, similar to the Israelites who worshipped idols (Exodus 32). The loathing is not personal animosity but a righteous indignation towards sin, akin to Jesus' reaction to the money changers in the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>).<p><b>because they do not keep Your word</b><br>The psalmist's disdain is rooted in the failure of the faithless to adhere to God's commandments. This highlights the importance of obedience in the biblical narrative, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to the observance of God's law. The phrase underscores the centrality of God's word in guiding moral and spiritual conduct. It also echoes the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which emphasizes being doers of the word, not just hearers. The psalmist's lament can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly kept God's word and grieved over Jerusalem's unfaithfulness (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love for God's law and a desire for righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithless.htm">The Faithless</a></b><br>Individuals who do not adhere to God's commandments, often seen as those who reject or neglect the covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_word.htm">God's Word</a></b><br>The divine commandments and teachings given to the people of Israel, which the Psalmist holds in high regard.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_word.htm">The Importance of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is a guiding light and a source of truth.
