In biblical times, lions were common in the region and symbolized power and ferocity. The psalmist, likely David, uses this metaphor to describe his perilous situation, possibly when he was fleeing from Saul. Lions are often used in Scripture to represent enemies or threats (e.g., <a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16-24</a>). This imagery underscores the intensity of the psalmist's distress and his reliance on God for protection.<p><b>I lie down with ravenous beasts&#8212;</b><br>The act of lying down suggests a sense of resignation or helplessness amidst danger. "Ravenous beasts" further emphasizes the threat posed by his adversaries, who are relentless and destructive. This could also allude to the wilderness experiences of David, where he faced both literal and figurative beasts. The imagery of beasts is used throughout the Bible to depict chaos and evil (e.g., <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13:1-2</a>).<p><b>with men whose teeth are spears and arrows,</b><br>Here, the psalmist shifts from animal imagery to describe his human enemies. The metaphor of teeth as "spears and arrows" highlights the verbal attacks and slander he faces. In ancient warfare, spears and arrows were common weapons, symbolizing the harm that words can inflict. This aligns with other biblical passages that speak of the destructive power of the tongue (e.g., <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>).<p><b>whose tongues are sharp swords.</b><br>The tongue as a "sharp sword" further illustrates the lethal nature of malicious speech. This metaphor is consistent with other scriptural references to the tongue's power (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>). The psalmist's depiction of his enemies' words as weapons underscores the spiritual and emotional battles he endures. This imagery also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who faced false accusations and verbal abuse (e.g., <a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-68</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, David, is expressing his distress and seeking God's protection.
