In biblical context, the poor and needy often symbolize those who are vulnerable and without power. The king's role as a protector and provider is emphasized, aligning with the responsibilities of a righteous ruler as seen in <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>. The Hebrew word for "pity" conveys a deep sense of mercy and compassion, suggesting an active response to suffering. This mirrors God's character as described in <a href="/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7-9</a>, where He upholds the cause of the oppressed and provides for the needy. The king's actions foreshadow the ministry of Jesus Christ, who demonstrated compassion for the poor and needy throughout His earthly ministry (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>and save the lives of the oppressed</b><br>The phrase underscores the king's role as a deliverer, a theme prevalent in the Old Testament where God frequently acts to save His people from oppression (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). The term "oppressed" refers to those who suffer under unjust treatment or hardship, often at the hands of the powerful. This reflects the biblical principle of justice, where the king is expected to act as God's agent in righting wrongs and delivering justice (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). The deliverance of the oppressed is a messianic expectation, pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior who liberates humanity from spiritual oppression (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>, <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). This phrase also connects to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God promises to end all forms of suffering and oppression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, Solomon was the son of King David and Bathsheba, known for his wisdom and wealth.
