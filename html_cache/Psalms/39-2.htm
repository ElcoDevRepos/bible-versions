In the ancient Near Eastern culture, silence could be a sign of wisdom or a way to avoid sinning with one's words. The psalmist's silence may also indicate a deep internal struggle or a response to overwhelming circumstances. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>, which suggests that even a fool is considered wise when silent. The psalmist's silence can be seen as a type of Christ, who, during His trial, remained silent before His accusers (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>).<p><b>I remained silent, even from speaking good,</b><br>The decision to refrain from speaking good suggests a profound level of restraint, possibly due to the fear that even well-intentioned words might be misunderstood or lead to further trouble. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>, which teaches that there is a time to be silent and a time to speak. The psalmist's silence, even from good, may indicate a period of introspection or waiting on God, similar to the way Jesus often withdrew to solitary places to pray and reflect (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>).<p><b>and my sorrow was stirred.</b><br>The stirring of sorrow suggests an internal turmoil that grows in the absence of verbal expression. This can be seen as a reflection of the human condition, where unexpressed emotions can intensify. The psalmist's experience resonates with the broader biblical theme of lament, where individuals bring their deepest pains before God, as seen in the Book of Lamentations. This sorrow can also be connected to the suffering of Christ, who bore the weight of human sin and sorrow (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-4</a>). The psalmist's stirred sorrow may also point to the refining process of trials, as described in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where perseverance through suffering leads to spiritual maturity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>, David is expressing his inner turmoil and struggle with remaining silent in the face of his distress.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate audience of David's lament, as he seeks understanding and relief from his suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist's_inner_conflict.htm">The Psalmist's Inner Conflict</a></b><br>The event of David's internal struggle with his emotions and the decision to remain silent, which is central to this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_silence.htm">The Power of Silence</a></b><br>Silence can be a powerful tool in managing emotions and avoiding sin.

By going &#8220;speechless,&#8221; he is practicing the wisdom of <a href="/proverbs/17-27.htm">Proverbs 17:27</a> &#8211; &#8220;Whoever restrains his words has knowledge.&#8221; This self-imposed quietness is not cowardice; it is a deliberate act of trust, echoing <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, &#8220;The LORD will fight for you, you need only to be still.&#8221; The psalmist refuses to let hasty words blur his witness or dishonor God&#8217;s name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I remained silent</b><p>The repetition underscores determination. <a href="/bsb/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a> is written &#8220;for Jeduthun,&#8221; a worship leader, hinting that what happens in David&#8217;s private struggle will be sung publicly. Like <a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>, David&#8217;s silence is meant to keep him from &#8220;sinning with his lips.&#8221; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> reminds every believer: &#8220;Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak.&#8221; Silence here is spiritual discipline, a pause that places God&#8217;s wisdom above David&#8217;s own impulses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even from speaking good</b><p>His restraint goes beyond avoiding angry outbursts; he withholds even helpful words. This mirrors <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>, &#8220;a time to keep silence, and a time to speak.&#8221; Why hold back good? Because the context (<a href="/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>) shows he fears that any speech in front of the wicked could be twisted. Better to wait for God&#8217;s timing, as Jesus did in <a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12&#8211;14</a> when He &#8220;gave no answer&#8221; before Pilate. Sometimes silence safeguards truth more effectively than premature explanations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my sorrow was stirred</b><p>The cost of silence is internal pressure. Like <a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>, the word pent-up becomes &#8220;a burning fire shut up in my bones.&#8221; David&#8217;s grief intensifies, not because silence is wrong, but because righteous longing for God&#8217;s vindication grows stronger. <a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a> testifies to the same tension: &#8220;When I kept silent, my bones wasted away.&#8221; Yet this stirring sorrow drives him back to the Lord, as verses 4&#8211;7 of the same psalm show, pushing him toward confession and renewed dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2</a> pictures a godly man biting his tongue before scoffers, choosing silence&#8212;even silencing well-meant words&#8212;to avoid dishonoring God. The pause is costly; it agitates his heart. Yet that very ache becomes a catalyst, forcing him to unload his burden at the feet of the Lord. The verse teaches believers that purposeful silence, though painful, can shield our witness and deepen our reliance on God&#8217;s timing and justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Even from good.</span>--This interpretation, while following the LXX., Vulg., and most ancient versions, is suspicious, since the particle, rendered <span class= "ital">from, </span>is not generally used in this sense after a verb expressing silence. Indeed there is only one instance which at all supports this rendering (<a href="/1_kings/22-3.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?">1Kings 22:3</a>, margin). Nor does the context require or even admit it. If the bright side of things had been so evident that he could speak of it the Psalmist would not have feared reproach for doing so, nor was there cause for his silence "as to the law," the rabbinical mode of explaining the passage. The obvious translation makes the clause parallel with that which follows: "I held my peace <span class= "ital">without profit. </span>My sorrow was increased," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>instead of lessening my grief by silence, I only increased it.<p><span class= "bld">Stirred.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg. "renewed," which is nearer the meaning than either the Authorised Version or margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good</span>. Some explain, "I held my peace, but <span class="accented">it did me no good</span> - I was none the better for it" (Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, Canon Cook); others adopt the Prayer-book Version, I kept silence <span class="accented">even from good words"</span> (Kay, Alexander, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And my sorrow was stirred</span>. The pain at my heart was not quieted thereby, nor even lessened; rather, it was roused up, quickened, and aggravated. This is the natural result of repressing any strong feeling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/39-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I was speechless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1463;&#1443;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;lam&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_481.htm">Strong's 481: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tie fast, to be tongue-tied</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and still;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1453;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#363;&#183;m&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1747.htm">Strong's 1747: </a> </span><span class="str2">A silence, a quiet waiting, repose</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I held my peace,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2814.htm">Strong's 2814: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be silent, inactive, or still</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[even] from good,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
