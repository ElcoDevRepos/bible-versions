Innocent blood refers to the unjust taking of life, which is a direct violation of God's commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). The shedding of innocent blood is often associated with idolatry and injustice throughout the Bible (<a href="/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>). It underscores the moral corruption that had infiltrated the nation.<p><b>the blood of their sons and daughters,</b><br>The mention of sons and daughters emphasizes the heinous nature of the Israelites' actions. Child sacrifice was a practice adopted from surrounding pagan cultures, particularly the Canaanites. This act was strictly forbidden by God (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>) and was considered an abomination. The sacrifice of children to false gods represents a complete departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh, who values life and family.<p><b>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,</b><br>The idols of Canaan refer to the false gods worshiped by the Canaanite people, such as Baal and Molech. These deities were often associated with fertility and prosperity, and their worship included detestable practices like child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). The Israelites' adoption of these practices indicates a profound spiritual decline and a breach of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and the land was polluted with blood.</b><br>The pollution of the land with blood signifies the defilement that results from sin. In biblical terms, the land itself is affected by the moral actions of its inhabitants (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>). This concept is rooted in the idea that the land is a gift from God and should be kept holy. The shedding of innocent blood defiles the land, leading to divine judgment and exile, as seen in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-21</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the need for redemption and cleansing, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose blood purifies and restores (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were led out of Egypt and into the Promised Land, yet often fell into idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, inhabited by various pagan nations whose practices included child sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_of_canaan.htm">Idols of Canaan</a></b><br>Pagan deities worshiped by the Canaanites, often involving detestable practices such as child sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/innocent_blood.htm">Innocent Blood</a></b><br>Refers to the children who were sacrificed, highlighting the gravity of the Israelites' sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pollution_of_the_land.htm">Pollution of the Land</a></b><br>The spiritual and moral defilement that resulted from the shedding of innocent blood, affecting the entire land of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>God values human life, and the shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin.

Scripture consistently treats the taking of innocent life as a grave offense&#8212;<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> reminds us that Abel&#8217;s blood &#8220;cries out&#8221; to God, and <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a> lists &#8220;hands that shed innocent blood&#8221; among the things the LORD hates. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a> warns Israel not to let &#8220;innocent blood be shed in your land,&#8221; underlining that obedience to God is the only safeguard against such evil.<p>Bullet points to grasp the weight of this charge:<p>&#8226; Innocent means guiltless&#8212;people who have done nothing to deserve death.<p>&#8226; Bloodshed is not only a personal sin; it is a communal contamination (<a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals covenant violation; God had expressly forbidden murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the blood of their sons and daughters</b><p>The horror deepens: the victims were their own children. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a> warns that the Canaanites &#8220;burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods,&#8221; a practice Israel was commanded to avoid. Yet <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a> record the heartbreaking reality that Israel followed the same path. The phrase stresses:<p>&#8226; Life belongs to God; parents are stewards, not owners (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Familial love was twisted into ritual murder&#8212;an inversion of God&#8217;s design (<a href="/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin always spreads when unchecked; yesterday&#8217;s small compromise becomes today&#8217;s atrocity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan</b><p>The motive behind the bloodshed was idolatry. <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> forbids offering children to Molech; <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a> attaches the death penalty to such worship. Idols demand what the living God does not&#8212;human sacrifice. Notice how <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a> links idolatry and violence: once God is displaced, His image-bearers are devalued. Key cross references:<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>: Manasseh &#8220;sacrificed his son in the fire&#8221; as he plunged Judah into decades of darkness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>: God says child sacrifice &#8220;never entered My mind,&#8221; underscoring its total incompatibility with His nature.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a> warns that sacrifices to idols are sacrifices to demons; spiritual rebellion always has demonic undertones.<p>and some practical takeaways:<p>&#8211; Idolatry is not merely ancient ritual; anything placed above God eventually harms people made in His image.<p>&#8211; Worship shapes ethics. False worship inevitably produces false morality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the land was polluted with blood</b><p>Sin is never contained; it defiles everything it touches. <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a> says, &#8220;Bloodshed defiles the land, and no atonement can be made&#8230; except by the blood of the one who shed it.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a> echoes that the earth is &#8220;defiled by its people&#8221; who break God&#8217;s covenant. When <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a> speaks of pollution, it points to:<p>&#8226; Spiritual contamination&#8212;God&#8217;s presence withdraws when holiness is abandoned (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Social breakdown&#8212;violence invites more violence (<a href="/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>).<p>&#8226; National judgment&#8212;exile came because the land could no longer sustain the sin (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>).<p>Modern parallels are sobering: cultures that dismiss God&#8217;s authority over life eventually experience moral and societal decay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a> is a stark reminder that when God&#8217;s people embrace the world&#8217;s idols, innocent lives are the first casualties, families are torn apart, worship is perverted, and the very ground we live on bears witness against us. The verse calls us to honor the sanctity of life, reject every form of idolatry, and remember that obedience to the living God preserves both people and land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/106.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Innocent blood.</span>--Human sacrifice, and especially that of <span class= "ital">children, </span>was a Canaanite practice.

And the land was polluted with blood. Contrary to the commandment given in Deuteronomy 35:33, "Ye shall not pollute the laud wherein ye are."
