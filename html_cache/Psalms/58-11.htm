It suggests a moment of realization or revelation, often seen in biblical narratives where God's actions lead to a change in human understanding. This aligns with the prophetic nature of many Psalms, where future events are foretold. The use of "men" indicates a universal recognition, not limited to Israel but extending to all humanity, reflecting the universal scope of God's justice.<p><b>&#8220;There is surely a reward for the righteous!</b><br>The concept of a reward for the righteous is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's justice and faithfulness. In the Old Testament, righteousness is often associated with adherence to God's law and covenant. This phrase reassures believers that their faithfulness will not go unnoticed. It echoes <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, which speaks of the righteous being rewarded. Theologically, it points to the ultimate reward of eternal life, a theme expanded in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings of Jesus and the writings of Paul.<p><b>There is surely a God who judges the earth!&#8221;</b><br>This statement affirms the existence and sovereignty of God as the ultimate judge. In the ancient Near Eastern context, gods were often seen as local or tribal, but this declaration asserts the universal jurisdiction of the God of Israel. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's judgment, seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, where Abraham acknowledges God as the judge of all the earth. This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological judgment described in Revelation, where God will judge the living and the dead. It underscores the biblical assurance that justice will ultimately prevail, a central hope for believers throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who live according to God's laws and seek to follow His will.
