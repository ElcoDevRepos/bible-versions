In the Hebrew context, "righteous" (&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1460;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, tzaddik) conveys the idea of being just, lawful, and morally right. Throughout the Old Testament, God's righteousness is a central theme, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a "God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He." The righteousness of God is foundational to His character and is reflected in His laws and commandments given to Israel. This righteousness is also a standard for human conduct, as seen in the call for believers to pursue righteousness in their own lives (<a href="/proverbs/21-21.htm">Proverbs 21:21</a>). Theologically, God's righteousness is fully revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies divine justice and offers His righteousness to believers through faith (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>).<p><b>and kind in all His deeds</b><br>The kindness of God, often translated as "lovingkindness" or "mercy" (&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;, chesed), is a recurring theme in the Psalms and throughout Scripture. This attribute highlights God's benevolent and compassionate nature. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, chesed was a covenantal term, reflecting God's steadfast love and faithfulness to His people. This kindness is evident in God's actions throughout biblical history, from His deliverance of Israel from Egypt to His provision and protection in the wilderness. The New Testament continues this theme, with Jesus Christ exemplifying God's kindness through His ministry, healing, and ultimate sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-5</a>). The kindness of God invites believers to trust in His goodness and to reflect His character in their interactions with others (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is characterized by righteousness and kindness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145</a>, a king of Israel known for his deep relationship with God and his poetic contributions to the Psalms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalms were originally given, serving as the context for understanding God's righteousness and kindness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist's_audience.htm">The Psalmist's Audience</a></b><br>The people of God, both in ancient times and today, who are encouraged to reflect on God's character.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deeds_of_the_lord.htm">The Deeds of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to God's actions throughout history, as recounted in the Bible, demonstrating His righteousness and kindness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_righteousness.htm">Understanding God's Righteousness</a></b><br>God's righteousness is inherent in His nature, meaning He always acts in accordance with what is right and just.<br><br>Believers are called to trust in God's righteous ways, even when circumstances are challenging or unclear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/experiencing_god's_kindness.htm">Experiencing God's Kindness</a></b><br>God's kindness is evident in His deeds, which are motivated by love and compassion for His creation.<br><br>Christians are encouraged to reflect God's kindness in their interactions with others, serving as a testament to His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_response_to_god's_character.htm">Living in Response to God's Character</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are to emulate God's righteousness and kindness in our daily lives.<br><br>This involves making ethical decisions, showing mercy, and extending grace to others, as God has done for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_consistent_character.htm">The Assurance of God's Consistent Character</a></b><br>God's character does not change; He is consistently righteous and kind, providing a firm foundation for our faith.<br><br>This assurance allows believers to approach God with confidence, knowing He is just and merciful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_god's_deeds.htm">Reflecting on God's Deeds</a></b><br>Regularly recounting and meditating on God's deeds helps believers to remain grounded in His truth and character.<br><br>This practice strengthens faith and encourages a deeper relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_145_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 145:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_145_17_on_God_s_righteousness.htm">How does Psalm 145:17 define God's righteousness in all His ways?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_kind_in_deeds_show_about_God.htm">What does "kind in all His deeds" reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_God_s_righteousness_daily.htm">How can we emulate God's righteousness in our daily actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/What_scriptures_show_God_s_righteousness.htm">Which other scriptures highlight God's righteousness and kindness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Psalm_145_17_on_interactions.htm">How should Psalm 145:17 influence our interactions with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_145_17_on_God_s_righteousness_2.htm">How does Psalm 145:17 define God's righteousness and faithfulness in all His ways?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_for_Psalm_145_17.htm">What historical context supports the claims of God's righteousness in Psalm 145:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Archaeology_s_link_to_Psalm_145_17.htm">How does archaeology affirm the themes presented in Psalm 145:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_145.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 145?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_one_be_righteous_(rom_3_10_vs._lk_1_5-6).htm">Can a person be righteous?
