In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was a symbol of strength and honor. The "Lord" here refers to God, who is depicted as supporting and empowering the king, traditionally understood as the Messiah. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is described as being at the right hand of His people, providing protection and victory (<a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's exaltation, as He is seated at the right hand of God (<a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><b>He will crush kings in the day of His wrath.</b><br>This phrase speaks to divine judgment and the ultimate victory over earthly powers. The imagery of crushing kings suggests a decisive and overwhelming defeat, which is a common theme in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). The "day of His wrath" refers to a time of judgment, often associated with the Day of the Lord, a future event when God will execute justice and establish His kingdom (<a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>). This can be seen as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Christ's return when He will judge the nations and establish His eternal reign (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>In this context, "The Lord" refers to God, who is depicted as a divine warrior and judge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_right_hand.htm">Your Right Hand</a></b><br>This phrase signifies a position of power and authority.

It is He who stretched out the sceptre and conferred the office of priest; and hitherto the king has been the person addressed. It is therefore necessary still to consider him as addressed, and suppose that the change of position of Jehovah from the king's right hand to his left is simply due to the usage of the language.
