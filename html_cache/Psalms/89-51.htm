Throughout biblical history, the enemies of Israel often taunted and ridiculed them, questioning the power and presence of their God. This is seen in the taunts of Goliath against the armies of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>) and the mocking of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19-35</a>). Theologically, this taunting represents the broader spiritual battle between good and evil, where the enemies of God challenge His sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>and have mocked every step of Your anointed one!</b><br>The "anointed one" refers to the king of Israel, who was chosen and consecrated by God to lead His people. In the Old Testament, the anointing of a king symbolized divine approval and empowerment (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Historically, this could refer to King David or his descendants, who faced opposition and ridicule from surrounding nations. Prophetically, this phrase also points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate Anointed One (Messiah), who faced mockery and scorn during His earthly ministry (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>). The mocking of the anointed one underscores the rejection of God's chosen leaders and, ultimately, the rejection of Christ by the world. This connects to the broader theme of suffering and vindication found throughout Scripture, where God's anointed often endure hardship but are ultimately upheld by God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is being addressed in this Psalm.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_god.htm">Enemies of God</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and His purposes, often seen as adversaries to His people and His anointed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One</a></b><br>Refers to the king of Israel, often seen as a type of the Messiah, who is God's chosen leader for His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, a wise man in the time of Solomon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often facing opposition from surrounding nations and internal struggles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_opposition.htm">Understanding Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that following God's call may lead to opposition and mockery, as seen in the life of God's anointed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Trust in God's covenant promises, even when circumstances seem contrary, as He remains faithful to His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identifying_with_christ.htm">Identifying with Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to share in the sufferings of Christ, understanding that mockery and opposition are part of our journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_vindication.htm">Hope in Vindication</a></b><br>Hold onto the hope that God will ultimately vindicate His people and His anointed, as seen in the resurrection and return of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_perseverance.htm">Prayer for Perseverance</a></b><br>Encourage a prayerful attitude, seeking strength and perseverance in the face of trials and opposition.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_89_51_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 89:51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Respond_to_taunts_against_God_s_chosen.htm">How can we respond to "taunts" against God's anointed in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_51_on_enduring_faith_mockery.htm">What does Psalm 89:51 teach about enduring mockery for our faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_51_and_Jesus_experiences_link.htm">How does Psalm 89:51 connect to Jesus' experiences in the New Testament?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_aid_leaders_mocked_for_faith.htm">In what ways can we support leaders facing "taunts" for their faith today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_51_Stay_steadfast_in_trials.htm">How can Psalm 89:51 encourage us to remain steadfast amidst opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_51_Divine_justice_vs_mockery.htm">How does Psalm 89:51 address the theme of divine justice amid human mockery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_89_51.htm">What historical context might have influenced the writing of Psalm 89:51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_51_Faith_vs_Doubt_Struggle.htm">How does Psalm 89:51 reflect the struggle between faith and doubt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_89.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 89?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/main_themes_of_psalms.htm">What are the main themes of the Psalms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_of_the_general_epistles.htm">How do you cut Rahab into pieces?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/types_of_psalms.htm">What are the different types of Psalms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_say_'kill'_or_'murder'.htm">What does 'You anoint my head with oil' mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 89:51 Mean</div><b>Your enemies</b><p>The psalmist identifies the opposition as God&#8217;s enemies, not merely Israel&#8217;s.
