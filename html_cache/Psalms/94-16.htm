In the biblical context, the "wicked" often refers to those who oppose God's laws and oppress His people. The psalmist is seeking divine intervention or a human agent empowered by God to confront injustice. This echoes the cries of the prophets who called for righteousness and justice, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, where the call is to "seek justice, correct oppression." The question implies a sense of urgency and desperation, highlighting the psalmist's reliance on God for deliverance. Historically, Israel faced numerous adversaries, both external and internal, who threatened their covenant relationship with God. This plea can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who ultimately rises against the forces of evil and sin.<p><b>Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?</b><br>The phrase "stand for me" suggests a need for support and defense, indicating that the psalmist feels vulnerable and in need of protection. "Workers of iniquity" refers to those who actively engage in sinful behavior, often with malicious intent. This is a common theme in the Psalms, where the righteous are often depicted as being under threat from the wicked. The call for someone to "stand" is reminiscent of the role of a judge or advocate, which in the New Testament is fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who stands as our intercessor (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The imagery of standing also conveys steadfastness and courage, qualities that are essential in the face of moral and spiritual opposition. This plea for divine or divinely inspired intervention reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's justice prevailing over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/94.htm">Psalm 94</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another psalmist, who is calling out for divine justice and support against the wicked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who commit acts of iniquity and oppose God's righteous ways, often oppressing the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector, whom the psalmist seeks for deliverance and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who align themselves with God's will and stand against evil, often facing persecution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_believers.htm">The Community of Believers</a></b><br>Implicitly addressed as those who are called to stand up against wickedness in solidarity with the psalmist.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_action.htm">The Call to Action</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively stand against evil and injustice, not passively observe.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>While we are called to stand, our strength and victory come from God, who is the ultimate judge and protector.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>Standing against wickedness is often a communal effort, requiring the support and unity of the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>It takes courage to stand against the tide of wickedness, but faith in God's justice empowers us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize that standing against wickedness is part of the spiritual battle that requires spiritual armor and prayer.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_94_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 94:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_can_you_defend_me_against_evil_today.htm">How can you "stand up for me" against wickedness in today's world?

God is not asking for spectators but for participants&#8212;think of Moses who &#8220;stood in the gate of the camp&#8221; and said, &#8220;Whoever is for the LORD, come to me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The question implies rarity; few are willing to confront evil. Elijah felt alone on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm">1 Kings 18:22</a>), yet his solitary stand became a turning point for the nation.<p>&#8226; The psalmist&#8217;s allegiance is clear: he identifies with God&#8217;s cause against the &#8220;wicked,&#8221; not merely personal enemies. <a href="/proverbs/28-4.htm">Proverbs 28:4</a> echoes this call: &#8220;Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God Himself intervenes when no person will (<a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>), but His first desire is that His people volunteer.<p>Practical application right now:<p>&#8211; Pay attention to moral issues in your community; silence can be complicity (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Rise in prayer, conversation, and action, always tethered to truth in love (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?</b><p>The second question intensifies the first. &#8220;Stand&#8221; suggests holding ground under pressure.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Workers of iniquity&#8221; are not merely mistaken; they are committed to wrong. <a href="/bsb/psalms/94.htm">Psalm 94</a> has just listed what they do: crush God&#8217;s people, oppress widows and orphans, and claim, &#8220;The LORD does not see&#8221; (vv. 3&#8211;7).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;stand&#8221; is to remain unshaken when culture normalizes sin. Daniel &#8220;resolved that he would not defile himself&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>) and kept standing, even in a den of lions (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this posture: &#8220;Put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>). Jude urges believers to &#8220;contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints&#8221; (Jude 3).<p>&#8226; God promises support: &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>), and He will ultimately repay every injustice (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>Ways to stand today:<p>&#8211; Speak biblical truth graciously in conversations where sin is rationalized.<p>&#8211; Defend the vulnerable&#8212;unborn, elderly, persecuted believers&#8212;through advocacy and sacrificial care (<a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8211; Refuse personal compromise; integrity undergirds public witness (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/94-16.htm">Psalm 94:16</a> is God&#8217;s rallying cry.
