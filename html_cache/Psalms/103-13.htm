In ancient Israel, the family unit was central to society, and the father's role was one of provision, protection, and guidance. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to convey God's nurturing and protective nature (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, where God is described as carrying Israel as a father carries his son). The father-child relationship is a recurring theme in the Bible, illustrating God's desire for a personal and loving relationship with His people.<p><b>so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him</b><br>The comparison here highlights the depth of God's compassion, which is likened to that of a loving father. The term "fear" in this context refers to a reverential awe and respect for God, acknowledging His holiness and authority. This fear is not about being afraid but about honoring God and living in obedience to His commandments. The promise of God's compassion is conditional upon this reverence, aligning with the covenantal relationship God established with Israel, where blessings were tied to obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). This compassion is also a reflection of God's character, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God describes Himself as "compassionate and gracious." The ultimate expression of God's compassion is found in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's love and mercy, offering salvation to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>A metaphorical representation of God, highlighting His nurturing and protective nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Represents the people of God, those who are in a covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_him.htm">Those who fear Him</a></b><br>Refers to believers who have a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His authority and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_compassion.htm">Understanding God's Compassion</a></b><br>God's compassion is likened to that of a loving father, emphasizing His deep care and concern for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord.htm">The Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>Fearing God involves a reverent respect and awe, which is foundational to receiving His compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/parental_analogy.htm">Parental Analogy</a></b><br>Just as earthly fathers are expected to care for their children, God perfectly fulfills this role, providing for and protecting His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_god.htm">Intimacy with God</a></b><br>Believers are invited into a close, familial relationship with God, where they can experience His love and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_compassion.htm">Reflecting God's Compassion</a></b><br>As recipients of God's compassion, we are called to extend the same compassion to others, reflecting His character in our relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_103_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 103:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_God_s_compassion_daily_2.htm">How can we emulate God's compassion as described in Psalm 103:13 daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_father_s_compassion_show_God.htm">What does "as a father has compassion" reveal about God's nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_103_13_Jesus_God_s_love_link.htm">How does Psalm 103:13 connect with Jesus' teachings on God's love?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_show_community_compassion.htm">In what ways can we show compassion to others in our community?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_compassion_on_relationship.htm">How does understanding God's compassion affect your relationship with Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_103_13_God_s_compassion_shown.htm">How does Psalm 103:13 illustrate God's compassion towards humanity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_103_13.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 103:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Archaeology_s_link_to_Psalm_103_13_themes.htm">How does archaeology support the themes found in Psalm 103:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_103.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 103?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_suffering_persist_if_god_cares.htm">Psalm 103:13 depicts God&#8217;s fatherly compassion&#8212;why then does widespread suffering and injustice persist if He is both caring and omnipotent? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_can_faith_help_overcome_despair.htm">How can faith help overcome despair?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_emblematic_parallelism.htm">What is Emblematic Parallelism in literature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_psalm_18_differ_from_103.htm">Why do the descriptions of God&#8217;s power in Psalm 18 seem inconsistent with passages portraying His more gentle attributes (e.g., Psalm 103)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 103:13 Mean</div><b>As a father</b><p>&#8226; God intentionally chooses the familiar picture of a loving dad.
