In biblical context, the term "Rock" is often used to symbolize strength, stability, and protection. In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, God is referred to as "the Rock," emphasizing His perfect work and justice. The imagery of God as a rock would resonate with the Israelites, who lived in a region where rocky landscapes were common, providing natural fortresses and places of refuge. This acknowledgment comes after a period of forgetfulness and rebellion, illustrating a cycle of sin and repentance that is prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The concept of God as a rock also foreshadows Christ, who is referred to as the spiritual rock in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, providing spiritual sustenance and salvation.<p><b>that God Most High was their Redeemer</b><br>The title "God Most High" underscores God's supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation. This name for God, "El Elyon," is used to emphasize His exalted position above all other gods and powers. The term "Redeemer" is rich with theological significance, pointing to God's role in delivering and saving His people. In the historical context of Israel, redemption often referred to God's acts of deliverance, such as the Exodus from Egypt. The concept of redemption is deeply rooted in the sacrificial system, where a price is paid to free someone from bondage or debt. This foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Redeemer in the New Testament. In <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>, Christ is said to have given Himself to redeem us from all lawlessness, highlighting the fulfillment of this redemptive promise. The acknowledgment of God as Redeemer reflects a recognition of His mercy and grace in restoring the relationship between Himself and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Referred to as the Rock and Redeemer, highlighting His strength, stability, and role in salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people who remembered God as their Rock and Redeemer, often forgetting and then recalling His faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>Implied as the place of bondage from which God redeemed the Israelites, showcasing His power and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for much of Israel's forgetfulness and subsequent remembrance of God's provision and protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is a key figure in leading the Israelites and reminding them of God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_rock.htm">God as the Rock</a></b><br>God is unchanging and reliable, providing a firm foundation for our faith.<br><br>In times of trouble, we can find stability and security in God, our Rock.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_redeemer.htm">God as the Redeemer</a></b><br>Redemption is central to God's relationship with His people, offering deliverance from sin and bondage.<br><br>Reflect on personal experiences of God's redemption and share testimonies to encourage others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Regularly recalling God's past faithfulness strengthens our trust in Him for the future.<br><br>Establish practices of remembrance, such as journaling or sharing accounts of God's work in your life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God's past deeds can lead to spiritual drift and disobedience.<br><br>Cultivate a heart of gratitude and remembrance to combat forgetfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_light_of_redemption.htm">Living in Light of Redemption</a></b><br>Our identity as redeemed people should influence our daily actions and decisions.<br><br>Seek to live a life that reflects the transformative power of God's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_35_God_s_role_as_Redeemer.htm">How does Psalm 78:35 remind us of God's role as our Redeemer today?
