The concept of divine blessing is central to the covenant relationship between God and His chosen leaders. In the historical context, blessings were seen as tangible evidence of God's approval and support. This aligns with the promises made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>, where God assures him of a lasting dynasty. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate blessing through Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The blessings bestowed upon the king can also be seen as a type of the spiritual blessings believers receive in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p><b>You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.</b><br>The imagery of a crown signifies authority, honor, and legitimacy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a crown was a symbol of kingship and divine approval. The use of "pure gold" emphasizes the value and purity of the king's rule, suggesting a reign that is both precious and divinely sanctioned. This can be connected to the Davidic Covenant, where God promises to establish David's throne forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Prophetically, this points to the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ, who is described as wearing many crowns in <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, symbolizing His ultimate authority and victory. The crown of gold also reflects the idea of the believer's reward in heaven, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, where the faithful are promised a crown of glory that will never fade away.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, King David, is traditionally understood to be the speaker, expressing gratitude for God's blessings and favor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of blessings and the one who bestows honor and victory upon the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crown_of_pure_gold.htm">Crown of Pure Gold</a></b><br>Symbolizes divine favor, authority, and the honor bestowed upon the king by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor_and_blessing.htm">Divine Favor and Blessing</a></b><br>Recognize that all blessings and honors in life come from God.

The welcome is God&#8217;s initiative, not earned by human effort (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-20.htm">2 Samuel 22:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This royal favor foreshadows the embrace believers receive in Christ, who said, &#8220;No one who comes to Me will ever be driven away&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The certainty of God&#8217;s welcome rests on His covenant faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>), giving the King confidence for present victory and future hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with rich blessings</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s welcome is not empty; it overflows &#8220;with rich blessings.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture speaks of God&#8217;s storehouse of goodness &#8220;reserved for those who fear You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Every need&#8212;spiritual, emotional, physical&#8212;is met in abundance (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s victories, provisions, and protection illustrate the tangible nature of these blessings (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures believers that God never greets us with mere words; He loads us daily with benefits (<a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You placed on his head</b><p>&#8226; Crowning is God&#8217;s action: &#8220;You placed&#8230;&#8221; The King does not crown himself; authority and honor originate with the LORD (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; David was anointed by Samuel at God&#8217;s command (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); later, God publicly affirmed that choice by granting David military triumphs (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, the ultimate King, the Father likewise confers honor: &#8220;God has highly exalted Him&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, any position or victory is a trust from God, calling for humility (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a crown of pure gold</b><p>&#8226; Literally fulfilled when David captured Rabbah and &#8220;took the crown from the head of their king&#8212;it was placed on David&#8217;s head&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold symbolizes value, purity, and enduring glory.

Literally true for David, perfectly fulfilled in Christ, and practically applied to every believer, the verse calls us to trust the God who freely receives, richly provides, sovereignly appoints, and eternally rewards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Thou preventest</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>comest to meet him. The word "prevent" is familiar in this sense in the English collect: "Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings." (Comp. <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm" title="O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.">Psalm 79:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>.) The "crown "is by some identified with that won by David at Rabbah Moab. Others make it refer to a coronation. Ewald thinks of a birthday celebration. Probably no more is intended than a symbol of victory and rejoicing. Maidens were accustomed to meet a monarch returning in victory, and to offer a <span class= "ital">crown, </span>or <span class= "ital">garland, </span>which was a symbol of extraordinary rejoicing. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a>; <a href="/songs/3-11.htm" title="Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-8.htm" title="Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:8</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/15-13.htm" title="And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.">Judith 15:13</a>; 3Ma 7:16.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou givest him blessings before he asks, and more than he asks..

It is remarked that David, as the result of one of his wars, did actually take the crown of the conquered king, which was a crown of gold, from off the king' s head, and place it upon his own head (<a href="/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>); but this is scarcely what is intended here.
