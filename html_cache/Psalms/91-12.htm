Angels are often depicted in Scripture as messengers and protectors of God's people (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). The imagery of being lifted up suggests a divine intervention that prevents harm. In the context of ancient Near Eastern culture, the idea of being carried or lifted by a superior being was a sign of favor and protection. This phrase also connects to the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where Satan quotes this verse to challenge Jesus to test God's protection (<a href="/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>). Jesus' response highlights the importance of trusting God without putting Him to the test.<p><b>so that you will not strike your foot against a stone</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the completeness of God's protection. In the historical context, walking on rocky paths was common, and stumbling was a frequent danger. The assurance that one will not even strike their foot against a stone signifies a promise of safety from even the smallest harm. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for avoiding spiritual pitfalls and temptations. Theologically, it points to the care God provides to ensure His people are not led astray or harmed by the trials of life. This protection is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who, though tempted, did not fall into sin, exemplifying perfect reliance on God's provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Divine messengers and protectors sent by God to guard and assist believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Moses or David, the author expresses trust in God's protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of protection and refuge for those who trust in Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believer.htm">The Believer</a></b><br>The individual who places their trust in God and is the recipient of His protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>Symbolic of obstacles or dangers that one might encounter in life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God assigns His angels to protect and guide believers, demonstrating His care and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Understanding the context and correct application of Scripture is crucial, as seen in the misuse of this verse by Satan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god.htm">Trust in God</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God, knowing that He provides protection from life's obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_angels.htm">Role of Angels</a></b><br>Angels are active participants in God's plan, serving as protectors and messengers for those who follow Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_obstacles.htm">Overcoming Obstacles</a></b><br>With God's help, believers can navigate and overcome the challenges and dangers they face.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_91_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 91:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Can_we_trust_angels_to_lift_us_up.htm">How can we trust God's angels to "lift you up in their hands"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_12_on_God_s_protective_care.htm">What does Psalm 91:12 teach about God's protection from harm?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_12_s_link_to_Matthew_4_6.htm">How does Psalm 91:12 connect to Jesus' temptation in Matthew 4:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_Psalm_91_12_in_daily_battles.htm">In what ways can we apply Psalm 91:12 to daily spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_12_Trust_in_God_s_care.htm">How does Psalm 91:12 encourage reliance on God's care and provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_12_and_divine_protection_link.htm">How does Psalm 91:12 relate to the concept of divine protection in Christianity?
