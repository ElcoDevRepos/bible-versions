In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which is often seen as a prophetic psalm, this can be interpreted as the coming of future generations or messengers who will carry forward the message of God's deeds. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's work being declared throughout generations, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>.<p><b>and proclaim His righteousness</b><br>The act of proclaiming God's righteousness involves declaring His just and holy nature. In the biblical context, righteousness is often associated with God's faithfulness to His covenant and His moral perfection. This proclamation is a central theme in the Psalms and throughout Scripture, where God's righteousness is celebrated and made known to others (<a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>). It also points to the ultimate revelation of God's righteousness through Jesus Christ, who embodies divine justice and mercy.<p><b>to a people yet unborn</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's message across time, reaching even those who are not yet born. It reflects the biblical principle of passing down faith and knowledge of God to future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. The idea of a legacy of faith is crucial in Scripture, ensuring that God's works and character are known and revered by all generations.<p><b>all that He has done</b><br>This encompasses the entirety of God's actions and deeds, which are to be recounted and celebrated. In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which begins with a cry of anguish and ends in triumph, "all that He has done" can be seen as a reference to God's deliverance and faithfulness. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive work, culminating in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a prophetic vision of future generations acknowledging God's righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/future_generations.htm">Future Generations</a></b><br>The "people yet unborn" refers to those who will come after the current generation, highlighting the enduring nature of God's deeds and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/proclamation_of_righteousness.htm">Proclamation of Righteousness</a></b><br>This event involves the declaration of God's righteous acts, emphasizing the importance of sharing God's works with future generations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_testimony.htm">The Importance of Testimony</a></b><br>Sharing personal and communal experiences of God's righteousness is crucial for the faith development of future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faith.htm">Legacy of Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to leave a legacy of faith by teaching and proclaiming God's deeds to those who come after them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_is_eternal.htm">God's Righteousness is Eternal</a></b><br>God's righteousness is not limited to one time or place;
