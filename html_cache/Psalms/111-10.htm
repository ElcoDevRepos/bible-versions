This fear is not about terror but reverence and awe for God's holiness and authority. It signifies a proper relationship with God, acknowledging His sovereignty and righteousness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was highly valued, and its pursuit was seen as a path to a successful and righteous life. The phrase suggests that true wisdom starts with recognizing and respecting God's position as Creator and Judge.<p><b>all who follow His precepts gain rich understanding.</b><br>The term "precepts" refers to God's commandments and teachings, as found in the Torah and throughout Scripture. Following these precepts involves obedience and a commitment to living according to God's will. This obedience is not merely external but involves a heart aligned with God's purposes. The promise of "rich understanding" implies that those who live by God's laws gain insight into life's complexities and moral clarity. This understanding is not just intellectual but practical, guiding believers in making decisions that honor God. The connection to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a> highlights how obedience to God's laws was meant to be a witness to the nations of Israel's wisdom and understanding.<p><b>His praise endures forever!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of God's worthiness to be praised. Throughout the Psalms, God's enduring praise is a recurring theme, reflecting His unchanging nature and everlasting kingdom (<a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>). The idea that His praise endures forever points to the eternal impact of His works and character. In a historical context, this enduring praise is seen in the continuous worship practices of Israel, such as the temple rituals and festivals. Theologically, it foreshadows the eternal worship of God in the new creation, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>, where every creature praises God. This eternal praise is a response to His faithfulness, justice, and mercy, which are evident throughout history and will continue into eternity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature, as well as His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>A key theme in biblical literature, often associated with living in accordance with God's will and understanding His ways.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/precepts.htm">Precepts</a></b><br>Refers to God's commandments and teachings, which guide believers in righteous living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/praise.htm">Praise</a></b><br>The act of worship and adoration directed towards God, acknowledging His greatness and eternal nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_wisdom.htm">The Foundation of Wisdom</a></b><br>True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of the LORD.

The meaning seems to be that "the beginning of wisdom is not found in keen insight, nor wide experience, nor the learn-hag of the schools, but in the temper of reverence and awe. The fear of the finite in the presence of the Infinite, of the sinful in the presence of the Holy, self-abhorring, adoring, as in Job's confession - this for the Israelite was the starting-point of all true wisdom" (Dean Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">A good under standing have all they that do his commandments</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that do them</span>; but the "commandments" of ver. 7 are, no doubt, intended. <span class="cmt_word">His praise endureth forever</span>.
