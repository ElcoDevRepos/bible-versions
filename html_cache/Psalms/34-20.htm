In the context of <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, David is expressing gratitude for God's deliverance from his enemies. The imagery of bones being protected suggests a comprehensive safeguarding of the individual's physical and spiritual well-being. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bones were often seen as the essence of a person's strength and vitality. This protection can be seen as a metaphor for God's overall preservation of the righteous. The idea of God as a protector is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and the Old Testament, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>not one of them will be broken.</b><br>This phrase is often seen as prophetic, pointing to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a> cites this verse in the context of Jesus' crucifixion, where it is noted that none of His bones were broken, fulfilling this scripture. This connection underscores the typology of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb, as the Passover lamb was required to be without broken bones (<a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>). The unbroken bones symbolize the completeness and perfection of Christ's sacrifice. Historically, breaking the legs of those crucified was a common practice to hasten death, but in Jesus' case, it was unnecessary, further affirming the fulfillment of this prophecy. This phrase highlights the divine orchestration of events in the life and death of Jesus, reinforcing the belief in God's sovereign plan and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in the New Testament narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm as a song of thanksgiving and praise to God for His deliverance and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The protector and deliverer, who is the central figure in this verse, ensuring the safety and integrity of the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are under God's protection, often seen as those who follow His ways and trust in Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>In the New Testament, this verse is seen as a prophetic reference to Jesus, whose bones were not broken during His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event where Jesus' fulfillment of this prophecy is highlighted, as His bones were not broken, unlike the common practice during crucifixions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God is a protector of His people, ensuring their safety and well-being.
