In the Old Testament, the sanctuary often refers to the tabernacle or temple, where God's presence dwelt among His people. This setting underscores the authority and sacredness of the proclamation. The sanctuary is a place of divine revelation, where God communicates His will to His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>, where God instructs Moses to build a sanctuary so He may dwell among them.<p><b>I will triumph!</b><br>This declaration of victory reflects God's sovereign power and assurance of success over His enemies. It is a statement of divine confidence and authority, reminiscent of God's promises to Israel throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>, where God assures His people of victory in battle. This triumph is not just military but also spiritual, foreshadowing the ultimate victory of God over sin and death through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>.<p><b>I will parcel out Shechem:</b><br>Shechem holds significant historical and covenantal importance in the Bible. It is the site where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Joshua renewed the covenant with Israel (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). By mentioning Shechem, the verse highlights God's ongoing faithfulness to His covenant promises. The act of parceling out land signifies God's authority to distribute the land according to His will, reinforcing His role as the divine ruler and provider.<p><b>and apportion the Valley of Succoth:</b><br>The Valley of Succoth is located east of the Jordan River, near the Jabbok River. It is associated with Jacob's journey and settlement after reconciling with Esau (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>). The mention of Succoth, along with Shechem, represents the breadth of God's dominion over the land promised to the descendants of Abraham. This apportioning signifies God's control over geographical and political boundaries, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled. It also reflects the unity and completeness of God's plan for His people, encompassing both sides of the Jordan River.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, declaring His sovereign plans and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>Represents the holy place from which God speaks, symbolizing His divine authority and presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>An ancient city in the central region of Canaan, significant in Israel's history as a place of covenant renewal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_succoth.htm">Valley of Succoth</a></b><br>A location east of the Jordan River, associated with Jacob's journey and settlement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The attributed author of this Psalm, who often sought God's guidance and celebrated His victories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God declares His plans from His sanctuary, reminding us of His ultimate control over nations and history.

The same God who communed with Moses &#8220;between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>) now addresses David&#8217;s battlefield concerns.<p>&#8226; Because the voice proceeds from the sanctuary, what follows is both sacred and certain; God&#8217;s promises are as unshakeable as the place from which they are uttered (<a href="/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will triumph!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God does not merely predict victory; He asserts it. &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; His triumph guarantees His people&#8217;s triumph: &#8220;With God we will perform valiantly; it is He who will tread down our foes&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This divine resolve encourages believers in every era.

He is reasserting ownership and control, not merely over territory but over covenant history.<p>&#8226; For struggling believers, this line confirms that God still manages the physical and spiritual inheritance of His people (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and apportion the Valley of Succoth.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Succoth lay east of the Jordan (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>) in territory later occupied by Gad.

God is reiterating that no plot lies outside His authority&#8212;He will set every boundary.<p>&#8226; In practical terms, this assures us that the Lord governs every detail of our lives, &#8220;determining their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a> records God&#8217;s own voice assuring David&#8212;and every believer&#8212;that from His holy throne He guarantees victory and retains absolute rights over the land He promised.

Shechem and Succoth appear to be named as a rude indication of the whole breadth of the country, from west to east. The fact that Dr. Robinson and Vandervelde have identified one Succoth on the right bank of Jordan, does not at all weaken the evidence for the existence of another on the east of that river. See <a href="/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.">Genesis 33:17</a>; <a href="/judges/8-5.htm" title="And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.">Judges 8:5</a> <span class= "ital">seq.; </span><a href="/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a> (where <span class= "ital">?mek </span>is used for valley, as here).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - Appeal is next made in God's promises. Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a "reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours," and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) and the blessing of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>).
