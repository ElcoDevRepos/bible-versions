The camp was a temporary dwelling place for the Israelites as they traveled towards the Promised Land. It was organized with the Tabernacle at the center, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The camp setting highlights the communal life of the Israelites and the challenges of maintaining order and faithfulness in a large, mobile community.<p><b>they envied Moses</b><br>Moses was the leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness. Envy towards Moses reflects a deeper issue of rebellion against God's appointed authority. This envy is documented in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram led a rebellion against Moses. Envy in this context is not just personal jealousy but a challenge to God's divine order and leadership.<p><b>as well as Aaron</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed by God as the first high priest. His role was crucial in mediating between God and the Israelites, especially in the sacrificial system. The envy towards Aaron, like that towards Moses, was a rejection of God's chosen priesthood. This rebellion against Aaron's priestly role is also seen in the incident of Korah's rebellion, where the challengers questioned Aaron's exclusive right to the priesthood.<p><b>the holy one of the LORD</b><br>This title emphasizes Aaron's consecration and set-apart status for God's service. As the high priest, Aaron was anointed and sanctified to perform sacred duties, symbolizing holiness and purity. The term "holy one" underscores the divine selection and sanctification of Aaron for his role. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who is the true "Holy One" and mediator between God and humanity, fulfilling the priestly role perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
