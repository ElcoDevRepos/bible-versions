It is often associated with joy and victory, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>, where Miriam, the prophetess, led the women with tambourines and dancing after the crossing of the Red Sea. This phrase emphasizes the physical expression of worship, highlighting that worship is not only vocal but also involves the body. Dancing, in this context, is a form of expressing joy and reverence before God, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>, where King David danced before the Lord with all his might. This reflects a wholehearted devotion and celebration of God's presence and works.<p><b>praise Him with strings and flute.</b><br>Stringed instruments, such as the harp and lyre, were integral to Hebrew worship and are frequently mentioned in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>). These instruments were used to accompany singing and were considered suitable for worship due to their melodic and harmonious sounds. The flute, a wind instrument, adds a different dimension to the musical worship, providing a soft and soothing sound. The combination of strings and flute suggests a rich and varied musical expression in worship, indicating that all forms of music can be used to glorify God. This diversity in musical instruments reflects the inclusivity of worship, where different talents and expressions are brought together to honor God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is calling for exuberant praise to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context of this Psalm is likely related to the worship practices in the Temple, where music and dance were integral parts of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/musicians_and_dancers.htm">Musicians and Dancers</a></b><br>Individuals who played instruments and danced as part of the worship service, emphasizing the communal and celebratory nature of praising God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_expression_in_worship.htm">Joyful Expression in Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be a joyful and expressive act.

The tambourine&#8217;s bright, rhythmic sound openly celebrates God&#8217;s victories, echoing scenes like Miriam leading Israel after the Red Sea, &#8220;Miriam &#8230; took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse invites worshipers to bring whatever is at hand. Whether at the tabernacle (<a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>) or in today&#8217;s sanctuary, the point is unrestrained, audible joy that declares, &#8220;Come, see what God has done!&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Instruments do not distract from praise; they amplify it, helping the whole congregation keep time and stay united in song (<a href="/psalms/81-2.htm">Psalm 81:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and dancing</b><p>&#8226; The body itself becomes an instrument.
