In ancient Israel, legal proceedings often involved witnesses who would testify against the accused. The term "hostile witnesses" suggests a deliberate intent to harm or deceive. This can be seen in the story of Naboth's vineyard (1 Kings 21), where false witnesses were used to unjustly accuse Naboth. The concept of false testimony is also addressed in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>), highlighting its seriousness in biblical law.<p><b>they make charges I know nothing about.</b><br>The psalmist expresses bewilderment and innocence regarding the accusations. This reflects a situation where the accused is unaware of any wrongdoing, emphasizing the injustice of the charges. This theme of innocence amidst false accusations is echoed in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also falsely accused by hostile witnesses (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>). The psalmist's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate innocent sufferer. The phrase underscores the psalmist's reliance on God for vindication, a common motif in the Psalms where the righteous seek divine justice against false accusations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing his distress over false accusations and the betrayal he faces from those who should be his allies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hostile_witnesses.htm">Hostile Witnesses</a></b><br>These are individuals who falsely accuse David, representing betrayal and injustice.
