Biblically, hands often symbolize action and power. The imagery of hands being used for wicked schemes suggests deliberate and premeditated sin. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hands were also seen as instruments of work and creativity, so using them for evil was a perversion of their intended purpose. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, which lists things the Lord hates, including "hands that shed innocent blood." The idea of wicked schemes is also reminiscent of the actions of figures like Judas Iscariot, who plotted against Jesus, fulfilling prophecies of betrayal.<p><b>whose right hands are full of bribes</b><br>The right hand is traditionally associated with strength, honor, and authority. In biblical times, the right hand was often used in oaths and covenants, symbolizing trust and integrity. However, in this context, the right hand being full of bribes indicates a betrayal of justice and righteousness. Bribery was a significant issue in ancient Israel, as it undermined the legal system and societal fairness. This phrase echoes the warnings found in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>, which cautions against taking bribes because they blind the clear-sighted and subvert the cause of the righteous. The corruption of justice through bribery is a theme that resonates throughout the Bible, contrasting with the purity and justice embodied by Jesus Christ, who is described as the righteous judge in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/26.htm">Psalm 26</a>, David is expressing his desire for vindication and his commitment to integrity and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked_schemes.htm">Wicked Schemes</a></b><br>Refers to the actions and plans of those who are deceitful and corrupt, often in positions of power or influence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bribes.htm">Bribes</a></b><br>A common practice in ancient times, as well as today, where individuals use money or gifts to influence decisions or actions, contrary to justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_leadership.htm">Integrity in Leadership</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to uphold integrity, especially in positions of influence.

Compare <a href="/proverbs/6-18.htm">Proverbs 6:18</a>, which lists a heart &#8220;that devises wicked schemes,&#8221; and <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>, where wrongdoers &#8220;devise iniquity&#8230; when morning comes, they carry it out.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David distances himself from such planners (<a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4&#8211;5</a>), showing that a life of integrity requires avoiding every partnership with sin-filled agendas (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The line also underscores moral responsibility. Those hands belong to accountable people, not victims of circumstance (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). God will judge the work of every hand (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, we guard our own hands by committing our plans to the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>) and keeping them busy with good (<a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whose right hands are full of bribes</b><p>The verse continues: their &#8220;right hands are full of bribes.&#8221; The right hand, biblically associated with power and honor (<a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>), is here corrupted by unjust gain.<p>&#8226; Bribes twist justice (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>) and pervert speech (<a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). David rejects any fellowship with those who use influence for personal profit.<p>&#8226; The picture is one of overflowing greed: hands so stuffed with illicit money they cannot hold truth or mercy (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Bribery affronts God&#8217;s character because He &#8220;shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). Followers of Christ must likewise maintain impartial integrity (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, this challenges every form of compromised influence&#8212;whether financial, relational, or digital. Instead, we are called to lift &#8220;holy hands, without anger or dispute&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/26-10.htm">Psalm 26:10</a> draws a stark line between the righteous and those who actively design evil and purchase favor. David&#8217;s plea for vindication rests on clean hands, free from schemes and bribes. In Christ we find both the forgiveness for past corruption and the power to keep our hands devoted to works that honor God and serve others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whose hands is mischief</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who are always occupied with some mischief or other - always engaged in carrying out wicked devices (see <a href="/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-17.htm">Proverbs 14:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And their right hand is full of bribes</span>.
