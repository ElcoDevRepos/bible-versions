In the ancient Near Eastern context, polytheism was prevalent, with many nations worshiping a pantheon of gods. The Israelites were called to be distinct, worshiping Yahweh alone. The warning of multiplied sorrows echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where turning away from God leads to various forms of suffering and distress. This principle is also seen in the story of Solomon, whose heart turned to other gods, leading to the division of the kingdom (1 Kings 11). Theologically, this phrase underscores the futility and spiritual peril of idolatry, as only the true God can provide lasting peace and joy.<p><b>I will not pour out their libations of blood,</b><br>Libations were liquid offerings poured out to deities, often part of pagan worship rituals. The mention of "blood" suggests particularly abhorrent practices, possibly including human sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden in Israelite law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). This phrase indicates a firm rejection of participating in or endorsing such idolatrous practices. The psalmist's stance reflects the call to holiness and separation from pagan customs, as seen in the laws given to Israel (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>). This refusal to engage in pagan rituals aligns with the broader biblical narrative of maintaining purity in worship and devotion to God alone.<p><b>or speak their names with my lips.</b><br>In ancient cultures, speaking the name of a deity was an act of reverence and acknowledgment. By refusing to even utter the names of other gods, the psalmist demonstrates a commitment to exclusive worship of Yahweh. This aligns with the first commandment, "You shall have no other gods before Me" (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), and the prohibition against taking the names of other gods on one's lips (<a href="/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>). Theologically, this reflects the importance of guarding one's speech as an expression of faith and allegiance. It also prefigures the New Testament emphasis on confessing Jesus as Lord (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>), highlighting the power and significance of the spoken word in worship and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16</a>, David is expressing his devotion to God and contrasting it with the practices of idol worshipers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>- Refers to the false deities worshiped by surrounding nations, which were often associated with pagan rituals and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/libations_of_blood.htm">Libations of blood</a></b><br>- A reference to the sacrificial practices of pagan worship, which often included offerings of blood to appease or honor their gods.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual sorrow and separation from God.

The literal text runs <span class= "ital">Their sorrows </span>[or, <span class= "ital">idols</span>] (<span class= "ital">fem.</span>)<span class= "ital"> are multiplied </span>(<span class= "ital">masc</span>)<span class= "ital">; another they hasten </span>[or, <span class= "ital">change</span>].<span class= "ital"> I will not pour out their libations from blood, and will not take their names upon my lips, </span>which, with one or two slight changes in the punctuation, becomes--<p>"They shall multiply their sorrows<p>Who change to another god:<p>I will not pour out their bloody libations,<p>Nor take their names on my lips."<p>At the same time, from the evident allusion to the curse on Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>, and the fact that the verb rendered "hasten" (comp. margin) means to buy a wife, it seems that the psalmist had the common prophetical figure for idolatry, viz., adultery, in his mind; but as he is not speaking of the Church as a whole, he does not work it out as the prophets do, by representing the idolaters as adulteresses.<p>The "libations of blood" seem to refer to the ghastly rites of Moloch and Chemosh. For the last clause comp. <a href="/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a>. To the Hebrews the very name of a god included a predication of his power. Hence the avoidance of even mentioning <span class= "ital">baal, </span>but substituting <span class= "ital">bosheth, i.e., </span>shameful thing, for it, even in proper names.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god</span>. This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would "hasten after" - or perhaps it should be translated "wed themselves to" - another god (see <a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect "prosperity," or joy of any kind. Their "sorrows will be multiplied;" distress and anguish will come upon them (<a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer.</span> Drink offerings of actual blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor take up their names into my lips</span>. By "their names" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods. The Law forbade the mention of these names by Israelites (<a href="/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/16-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sorrows</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
