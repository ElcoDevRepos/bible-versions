In ancient Israel, kings were often seen as representatives of divine authority. The term "King of Glory" emphasizes God's supreme majesty and honor. This phrase can be connected to the anticipation of the Messiah, who is recognized as the ultimate King of Glory in Christian theology. The question also serves to engage the listener or reader, prompting them to consider the attributes and sovereignty of God.<p><b>The LORD strong and mighty,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's omnipotence and strength. In the context of ancient Near Eastern culture, strength and might were essential qualities for a king, especially in times of war. The LORD's strength is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, indicating His ability to uphold justice and righteousness. This description aligns with other biblical passages that depict God as a warrior and protector of His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, where God is described as a "man of war."<p><b>the LORD mighty in battle.</b><br>This emphasizes God's role as a divine warrior who fights on behalf of His people. In the historical context of Israel, battles were often seen as spiritual as well as physical conflicts, with victory attributed to divine intervention. The LORD's might in battle assures believers of His power to overcome any adversary. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ is depicted as a conquering King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_glory.htm">King of Glory</a></b><br>This title refers to God, emphasizing His majesty, power, and divine authority.
