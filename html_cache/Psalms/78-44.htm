The transformation of the Nile River into blood was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, particularly Hapi, the god of the Nile, demonstrating the supremacy of the God of Israel. The Nile was the lifeblood of Egypt, essential for agriculture, transportation, and daily life. Turning it to blood symbolized a complete disruption of Egyptian society and economy. This act also prefigures the power of Christ's blood in the New Testament, which brings both judgment and redemption.<p><b>and from their streams they could not drink</b><br>The inability to drink from the streams highlights the severity of the plague. It was not just the main river but all water sources that were affected, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment. This mirrors the spiritual thirst that can only be quenched by the living water offered by Jesus (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). The Egyptians' reliance on the Nile contrasts with the believer's reliance on God for sustenance and life. This event also foreshadows the eschatological judgments in Revelation, where waters are again turned to blood (<a href="/revelation/16-4.htm">Revelation 16:4-6</a>), underscoring the theme of divine retribution and the ultimate triumph of God's justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and judgment over Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation that experienced God's plagues, including the turning of rivers to blood, as a judgment for enslaving the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they were God's chosen leaders to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God&#8217;s commands, leading to the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues_of_egypt.htm">The Plagues of Egypt</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments, including the turning of water to blood, intended to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme authority over nature and nations.

He rules over creation for both blessing and judgment.<p>&#8226; Because the Lord is unchanging (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>), His interventions&#8212;whether merciful or disciplinary&#8212;always flow from His righteous character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their rivers to blood</b><p>The text reaches back to Egypt, where the Nile&#8212;lifeblood of the nation&#8212;was struck (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Converting life-giving water into blood vividly exposed Egypt&#8217;s idolatry; they worshiped the Nile, yet it became a curse (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; This miracle was literally fulfilled; Scripture records &#8220;the fish in the Nile died&#8221; and &#8220;the Nile stank.&#8221; God&#8217;s historic acts are factual, not literary embellishments (<a href="/psalms/105-29.htm">Psalm 105:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows future judgments: <a href="/revelation/16-4.htm">Revelation 16:4</a> pictures end-time waters &#8220;turned to blood.&#8221; Divine justice remains consistent across eras.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from their streams</b><p>God&#8217;s reach extended beyond the main river to &#8220;streams, canals, ponds, and reservoirs&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment was comprehensive.
