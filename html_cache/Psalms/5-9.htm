In biblical context, the psalmist often contrasts the faithfulness of God with the untrustworthiness of the wicked. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4-5</a>, where deceit and betrayal are prevalent among the people. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on truthfulness, as seen in the Ten Commandments' prohibition against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The psalmist's lament reflects a society where trust has eroded, a situation that can lead to social and spiritual decay.<p><b>destruction lies within them.</b><br>This phrase suggests that the wicked harbor intentions of harm and chaos. The Hebrew word for "destruction" can also imply ruin or calamity, indicating that their inner nature is corrupt and leads to destructive outcomes. This internal corruption is a recurring theme in the Psalms, where the heart's condition is often linked to one's actions (<a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). The imagery of internal destruction aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>, where He explains that evil thoughts and actions originate from the heart. This connection underscores the biblical principle that inner character determines outward behavior.<p><b>Their throats are open graves;</b><br>The metaphor of "open graves" conveys the idea of death and decay emanating from the wicked. In ancient Near Eastern culture, graves were associated with impurity and defilement. An "open grave" would be a source of contamination, symbolizing the corrupting influence of the wicked's words. This imagery is also used by the Apostle Paul in <a href="/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a> to describe humanity's sinful nature, reinforcing the universality of sin and the need for redemption. The open grave metaphor serves as a stark warning of the spiritual death that accompanies deceit and malice.<p><b>their tongues practice deceit.</b><br>The act of practicing deceit with the tongue highlights the intentional and habitual nature of the wicked's falsehoods. In biblical literature, the tongue is often depicted as a powerful instrument capable of great harm or good (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-8</a>). The psalmist's observation aligns with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the dangers of a deceitful tongue (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament's call for believers to speak truthfully and avoid deceit (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). The consistent biblical message is that integrity in speech reflects a heart aligned with God's righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/5.htm">Psalm 5</a>, David is expressing his lament and seeking God's guidance and protection against deceitful and wicked people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>The individuals described in this verse are characterized by their deceitful speech and destructive intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector whom David seeks for guidance and deliverance from the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to build up or destroy.
