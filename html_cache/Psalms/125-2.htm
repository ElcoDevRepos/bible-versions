This imagery of mountains surrounding the city symbolizes protection and stability. Historically, Jerusalem has been a central location for the Israelites, serving as the political and spiritual capital. The mountains, such as the Mount of Olives and Mount Zion, are significant in biblical narratives, often representing God's enduring presence and strength. This phrase evokes the idea of divine protection, much like the physical protection offered by the mountains.<p><b>so the LORD surrounds His people</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's protective nature over His people, akin to the mountains' encircling presence. In the Old Testament, God's covenant with Israel is a recurring theme, where He promises to be their shield and defender. This protection is not just physical but also spiritual, safeguarding them from external threats and internal strife. The imagery here can be connected to other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>, which speaks of God as a refuge and fortress. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of God's presence through the Holy Spirit, surrounding and indwelling believers.<p><b>both now and forevermore</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's protection. It assures believers of God's unchanging and perpetual care, transcending time. The concept of God's eternal nature is a cornerstone of biblical theology, affirming His omnipresence and omnipotence. This assurance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>, which states that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. It also points to the eschatological hope found in Revelation, where God's people will dwell securely in His presence for eternity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, often symbolizing God's presence and protection.

All the surrounding hills are higher: in the east, the Mount of Olives; on the south, the so-called Hill of Evil Counsel, which ascends from the valley of Hinnom; on the west, the ground rises gently to the border of the great wadi, as described above; while on the north the bend of a ridge which adjoins the Mount of Olives limits the view to the distance of about a mile and a half."
