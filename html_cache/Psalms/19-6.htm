In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the sun was often associated with deities, but in the biblical context, it is a creation of the one true God, demonstrating His sovereignty over all creation. The imagery of the sun rising is also a metaphor for God's faithfulness and the renewal of His mercies each day, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>.<p><b>and runs its circuit to the other</b><br>The sun's circuit from one end of the heavens to the other illustrates the consistency and reliability of God's creation. This reflects the idea of God's omnipresence and omnipotence, as nothing is hidden from His sight. The sun's predictable path can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, bringing spiritual illumination and life to all.<p><b>nothing is deprived of its warmth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sun's universal reach and the life-giving warmth it provides, symbolizing God's provision and care for all creation. The warmth of the sun is a reminder of God's grace, which is available to all people, as echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>, where God causes the sun to rise on both the evil and the good. This also points to the inclusivity of the gospel message, which is meant for all nations and peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
