The "assembly of the people" refers to the gathering of the Israelites, which was a central aspect of their communal life. In ancient Israel, assemblies were often held at the temple in Jerusalem, a place of significant religious and cultural importance. This setting underscores the communal nature of worship, where individuals come together to honor God collectively. The act of exalting God in such a setting emphasizes the importance of corporate worship, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a> and <a href="/hebrews/2-12.htm">Hebrews 2:12</a>, where the faithful are encouraged to declare God's name among the congregation. This public declaration of faith serves as a testimony to others and strengthens the community's spiritual bond.<p><b>and praise Him in the council of the elders.</b><br>The "council of the elders" refers to the leaders and decision-makers within the community. In ancient Israel, elders were respected figures who held authority and were responsible for maintaining justice and order. Praising God in their presence highlights the importance of integrating faith into leadership and governance. This phrase suggests that those in positions of authority should also be involved in worship and set an example for others. It reflects the biblical principle that leadership should be grounded in reverence for God, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. The inclusion of elders in worship underscores the idea that all levels of society, from the general populace to its leaders, are called to honor God, ensuring that His principles guide both personal and communal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_the_people.htm">The Assembly of the People</a></b><br>This refers to the gathering of the Israelites, often for worship or important communal decisions.
