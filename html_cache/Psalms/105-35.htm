The locusts were a divine judgment against Pharaoh and the Egyptians for their refusal to release the Israelites from slavery. In the ancient Near East, locust swarms were a well-known and feared natural disaster, capable of devastating crops and leading to famine. The use of locusts as a plague highlights God's control over nature and His ability to use it to fulfill His purposes. This event is a demonstration of God's power and a reminder of the consequences of hardening one's heart against His commands.<p><b>and consumed the produce of their soil.</b><br>The destruction of the produce of the soil signifies the complete devastation of Egypt's agricultural resources. Agriculture was the backbone of the Egyptian economy, and the Nile River's annual flooding made the land particularly fertile. The locusts consuming the produce would have led to severe economic and social consequences, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision and the consequences of disobedience. In contrast, the Israelites, who were obedient to God's instructions, were spared from the plagues, illustrating the protective nature of God's covenant with His people. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, a type of Christ's deliverance of believers from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the plagues, including the plague of locusts, took place.

Picture a dark cloud settling over fields, leaves disappearing in seconds. Scripture treats this as a literal historical event, one of the ten plagues demonstrating the Lord&#8217;s absolute power over nature, Pharaoh, and Egypt&#8217;s gods (<a href="/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>).
