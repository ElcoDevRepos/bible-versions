Trust in the LORD is a central tenet of faith, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages believers to trust in God rather than their own understanding. In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, this trust is expressed amidst suffering and mockery, highlighting the psalmist's unwavering faith. This phrase also foreshadows the trust Jesus exhibited during His crucifixion, as He committed His spirit into the Father's hands (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>).<p><b>let the LORD deliver him</b><br>The call for divine deliverance is a recurring motif in the Psalms, where the psalmist often seeks God's intervention in times of distress. This plea for deliverance is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the crucifixion narrative, where Jesus is mocked with similar words (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>). The expectation of deliverance underscores the belief in God's power and willingness to save those who are faithful to Him.<p><b>let the LORD rescue him</b><br>The concept of rescue is integral to the biblical narrative, where God is frequently depicted as a rescuer of His people, as seen in the Exodus story. This phrase emphasizes God's role as a savior and protector. In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, it highlights the psalmist's hope for divine intervention. This plea is prophetically linked to Christ's crucifixion, where the mockers challenge Jesus' divine sonship and His relationship with the Father.<p><b>since He delights in him</b><br>The idea of God delighting in an individual is significant, as it implies a special relationship and favor. This phrase suggests that the person in question is righteous and pleasing to God. In the broader biblical context, this delight is seen in God's relationship with His chosen ones, such as David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ. At Jesus' baptism and transfiguration, God expresses His delight in His Son (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17, 17</a>:5), affirming His identity and mission. This connection reinforces the messianic interpretation of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, pointing to Jesus as the fulfillment of this prophetic psalm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of abandonment and mockery from his enemies, yet he maintains his trust in God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mockers.htm">Mockers</a></b><br>The individuals who are taunting and ridiculing the psalmist, challenging his faith and trust in God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, whom David trusts for deliverance and rescue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>In the New Testament, this verse is seen as prophetic, pointing to the crucifixion of Jesus, where similar words were spoken by the onlookers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of Jesus' crucifixion, where the events of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> are echoed in the New Testament account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_amidst_mockery.htm">Trust in God Amidst Mockery</a></b><br>Despite the ridicule and scorn from others, believers are called to maintain their trust in God, knowing that He is their ultimate deliverer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Psalm 22 serves as a powerful prophecy of the suffering of Christ, reminding us of the accuracy and divine inspiration of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_delight_in_his_people.htm">God's Delight in His People</a></b><br>The mockers' statement ironically affirms a truth: God does delight in His people, and His plans for them are ultimately for their good and His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_through_suffering.htm">Endurance Through Suffering</a></b><br>Like David and Jesus, believers are encouraged to endure suffering with faith, trusting that God sees and will act in His perfect timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_scripture_in_trials.htm">The Power of Scripture in Trials</a></b><br>Psalm 22 can be a source of comfort and strength, reminding us that our struggles are not unnoticed by God and that He has a plan for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_22_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 22:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_22_8_s_link_to_Jesus_mockery.htm">How does Psalm 22:8 foreshadow the mocking of Jesus in the Gospels?

On the cross He declared, &#8220;Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), showing perfect reliance even while suffering.<p>&#8226; Trust here is not wishful thinking but a settled conviction in God&#8217;s character&#8212;echoed in <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>, &#8220;Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a> reflects the Messiah&#8217;s example: &#8220;When He suffered, He did not threaten, but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let the LORD deliver him;</b><p>&#8226; Mockers twist David&#8217;s faith into taunt, urging God to prove Himself. Similar scorn greeted Jesus: &#8220;He trusts in God; let God deliver Him now&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance (Hebrew idea of slipping out of danger) is something David had experienced before (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4&#8211;7</a>). The jest implies God will now fail&#8212;exactly what Satan proposed in <a href="/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>.<p>&#8226; For believers, deliverance may come through rescue or through sustaining grace (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17&#8211;18</a>). Either way, the LORD remains the Deliverer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let the LORD rescue him,</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rescue&#8221; emphasizes bringing out of distress. <a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a> celebrates this: &#8220;He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; At Calvary, Jesus willingly declined immediate rescue so that the greater salvation plan could be accomplished (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). The scoffers could not grasp that choosing not to be rescued was the path to rescuing others (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The plea drips with irony: the One who came to rescue sinners is mocked for apparently lacking rescue Himself (<a href="/mark/15-31.htm">Mark 15:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since He delights in him.</b><p>&#8226; The taunt questions God&#8217;s pleasure in His servant. Yet divine delight is affirmed at Jesus&#8217; baptism: &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; David knew this truth personally: &#8220;The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness&#8230; He was pleased with me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s delight rests on those who trust Him (<a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>). The mockers misread suffering as abandonment, but Scripture presents it as part of a redemptive plan that neither negates God&#8217;s pleasure nor His ultimate vindication (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a> captures the sneering voice of unbelief, yet every phrase simultaneously testifies to the unwavering faith of David and, supremely, of Christ. Trust placed in the LORD invites both ridicule and ultimate vindication. Though scoffers challenge God to act, the Servant&#8217;s confidence remains secure, and God&#8217;s delight is undiminished. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection we witness the final answer: the LORD does indeed deliver, rescue, and vindicate the one who trusts in Him&#8212;and through that victory welcomes all who follow the same path of trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He trusted.</span>--So the LXX.
