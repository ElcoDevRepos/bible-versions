The psalmist, Asaph, is expressing a moment of intense inner conflict and sorrow. In the broader context of <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph grapples with the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous, which causes him to question God's justice. This grief is not just emotional but also spiritual, as it challenges his faith and understanding of God's ways. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This phrase can be connected to other scriptures where the heart is central to one's relationship with God, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding the heart as it is the wellspring of life.<p><b>and I was pierced within</b><br>The imagery of being "pierced" suggests a deep, penetrating pain, akin to being wounded. This internal piercing can be understood as a conviction or realization that cuts to the core of one's being. In the context of <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, this piercing may represent the moment of clarity or awakening when Asaph recognizes his own envy and bitterness towards the prosperity of the wicked. This realization is painful but necessary for spiritual growth and repentance. The concept of being pierced can also be seen in the New Testament, where the Word of God is described as sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). This connection highlights the transformative power of divine truth in revealing and correcting the inner thoughts and attitudes of the heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court. He is known for his honest and heartfelt psalms that often explore the tension between the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary_of_god.htm">The Sanctuary of God</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in verse 21, the sanctuary plays a crucial role in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>. It is where Asaph gains understanding and perspective on his struggles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Throughout <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph contrasts his own struggles with the apparent prosperity of the wicked, which initially causes him distress and confusion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_inner_turmoil.htm">The Reality of Inner Turmoil</a></b><br>Asaph's experience reminds us that believers can experience deep emotional and spiritual struggles.
