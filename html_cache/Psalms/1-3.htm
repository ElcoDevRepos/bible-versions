In biblical times, water was a precious resource, especially in the arid regions of the Middle East. A tree planted by water signifies a life that is constantly nourished and sustained. This can be seen as a metaphor for a person who is rooted in God's Word, drawing spiritual sustenance from it. The idea of being "planted" indicates intentionality and purpose, suggesting that the righteous person is deliberately positioned to receive divine nourishment. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>, where the person who trusts in the Lord is compared to a tree by the water, emphasizing trust and reliance on God.<p><b>yielding its fruit in season</b><br>The phrase "yielding its fruit in season" highlights the natural and timely productivity of a life aligned with God's will. Just as a tree bears fruit at the appropriate time, so does a righteous person produce good works and spiritual fruit at the right moments. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the "fruit of the Spirit" is described, indicating the qualities that should be evident in a believer's life. The idea of "in season" suggests that there is a divine timing for everything, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, where there is a time for every purpose under heaven.<p><b>whose leaf does not wither</b><br>A leaf that does not wither signifies enduring vitality and resilience. In the harsh climate of the ancient Near East, a tree with unwithered leaves would be a remarkable sight, symbolizing a life that remains vibrant and steadfast despite external challenges. This can be seen as a promise of spiritual perseverance for those who remain connected to God. The imagery of unfading leaves is also found in <a href="/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>, where the leaves of the trees by the river are for healing, indicating ongoing life and health.<p><b>and who prospers in all he does</b><br>The prosperity mentioned here is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and holistic well-being. The biblical concept of prosperity often includes success in fulfilling God's purposes and experiencing His blessings. This aligns with <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, where meditating on God's law is linked to prosperity and success. The idea is that a life lived in accordance with God's Word will naturally lead to flourishing in various aspects, as God blesses and guides the righteous. This prosperity is ultimately rooted in a relationship with God, who is the source of all true success and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_man.htm">The Righteous Man</a></b><br>The individual described in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> is a person who delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night, as outlined in the preceding verses.

The full moral bearing of the image appears in our Lord's parabolic saying, "a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit." The physical growth of a tree has in all poetry served as a ready emblem of success, as its decay has of failure. (Recall Wolsey's comment on his fall in Shakespeare's <span class= "ital">Henry VIII.</span>) Nor has the moral significance of vegetable life been ignored. "If," says a German poet, "thou wouldest attain to thy highest, go look upon a flower, and what that does unconsciously do thou consciously." In Hebrew poetry a moral purpose is given to the grass on the mountain side and the flower in the field, and we are taught that "there is not a virtue within the widest range of human conduct, not a grace set on high for man's aspiration, which has not its fitting emblem in vegetable life."--<span class= "ital">Bible Educator,</span> ii, p. 179.<p>For the general comparison of a righteous man to a tree, comp. <a href="/psalms/3-8.htm" title="Salvation belongs to the LORD: your blessing is on your people.

Naturally the actual kind of tree in the poet's thought interests us. The oleander suggested by Dean Stanley (<span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>146), though answering the description in many ways, fails from its want of fruit to satisfy the principal condition. For, as Bishop Hall says, "Look where you will in God's Book, you shall never find any lively member of God's house, any true Christian, compared to any but <span class= "ital">a fruitful </span>tree." Probably the <span class= "ital">palm </span>meets all the conditions best.

We find it again in <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>, and frequently in the prophets. The "rivers of water" spoken of (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) are undoubtedly the "streams" (Revised Version) or "canals of irrigation" so common both in Egypt and in Babylonia, by which fruit trees were planted, as especially date-palms, which need the vicinity of water. That such planting of trees by the waterside was known to the Israelites is evident, both from this passage and from several others, as <a href="/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5, 8</a>, etc. It is misplaced ingenuity to attempt to decide what particular tree the writer had in his mind, whether the palm, or the oleander, or any other, since he may not have been thinking of any particular tree. <span class="cmt_word">That bringeth forth his fruit in his season</span>. Therefore not the oleander, which has no fruit, and is never <span class="accented">planted</span> in the East, but grows naturally along the courses of streams. <span class="cmt_word">His leaf also shall not wither</span>. Compare the contrary threat of Isaiah against the wicked of his time, "Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water" (<a href="/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper</span>; rather, perhaps, in <span class="accented">whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
