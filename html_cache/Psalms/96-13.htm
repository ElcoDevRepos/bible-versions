In biblical times, being "before the LORD" signified standing in His presence, often associated with worship and reverence. The Israelites understood the importance of approaching God with humility and respect, as seen in the practices of the Tabernacle and Temple worship. This phrase also connects to the idea of God's omnipresence, as He is always present to observe and judge His creation.<p><b>for He is coming&#8212;He is coming to judge the earth.</b><br>This anticipates the future coming of the Lord, a theme prevalent in both the Old and New Testaments. The expectation of God's coming to judge is a central eschatological theme, reflecting the belief in a final judgment where God will set things right. This connects to prophecies in books like Isaiah and Daniel, and is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in Revelation. The repetition of "He is coming" underscores the certainty and imminence of this event.<p><b>He will judge the world in righteousness</b><br>God's judgment is characterized by righteousness, meaning it is fair, just, and according to His holy standards. This reflects God's nature as a righteous judge, as seen throughout Scripture. The concept of divine righteousness is foundational in the Bible, with God's laws and commandments serving as the standard for human conduct. This phrase assures believers that God's judgment will be impartial and just, aligning with passages like <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a> and <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>.<p><b>and the peoples in His faithfulness.</b><br>God's faithfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting His unwavering commitment to His promises and His people. This phrase assures that God's judgment will be consistent with His covenantal faithfulness, as He remains true to His word. The faithfulness of God is a source of comfort and hope for believers, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>.
