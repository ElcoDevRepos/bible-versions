The oppression often served as a divine consequence for turning away from God's commandments. Historically, Israel was surrounded by powerful nations such as Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, which frequently posed threats. The oppression can be seen as a fulfillment of warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, where God warned that disobedience would lead to subjugation by enemies. This pattern of oppression and deliverance is a cycle seen throughout the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls into sin, is oppressed, cries out to God, and is delivered by a judge.<p><b>and subdued them under their hand</b><br>The subjugation under enemy hands signifies a loss of autonomy and freedom, often resulting in servitude or exile. This phrase indicates a complete domination, where Israel was not only oppressed but also brought under the control of foreign powers. Historically, this was evident during the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were taken captive and lived under Babylonian rule. Theologically, this subjugation serves as a reminder of the consequences of forsaking God's covenant. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin and death, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>. The imagery of being subdued under a hand can also be connected to the prophetic hope of a future where God's people will be restored and no longer subject to foreign powers, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who often found themselves oppressed due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Various nations and peoples who oppressed the Israelites, such as the Philistines, Babylonians, and Assyrians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The state of being subject to unjust treatment or control, often as a consequence of Israel's disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/subjugation.htm">Subjugation</a></b><br>The act of bringing someone under control, which in this context refers to the Israelites being dominated by their enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, which included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites faced oppression due to their disobedience, we too can experience spiritual and sometimes physical consequences when we turn away from God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_discipline.htm">God's Sovereignty in Discipline</a></b><br>God allows discipline as a means to bring His people back to Him.
