Throughout the Bible, reliance on God is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who hope in the Lord renew their strength. The idea of blessing is deeply rooted in the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The strength mentioned here is not merely physical but spiritual, indicating a reliance on God's power and provision in all aspects of life. This reliance is a mark of faith and trust, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like David, who often spoke of God as his strength and refuge (<a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18:1-2</a>).<p><b>whose hearts are set on pilgrimage</b><br>The concept of pilgrimage in this context refers to the journey to the temple in Jerusalem, a central aspect of Jewish worship and religious life. Pilgrimages were times of spiritual renewal and reflection, as seen in the annual feasts such as Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>). The heart being set on pilgrimage indicates a deep, inner desire to seek God and His presence, reflecting a commitment to spiritual growth and devotion. This journey can also be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, which is often described as a journey or walk of faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>). The pilgrimage motif connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's people as sojourners and exiles, looking forward to a heavenly homeland (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>). This longing for God's presence and the ultimate fulfillment of His promises is a type of the believer's journey towards eternal life with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_korah.htm">Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who served in the temple.

It is improbable that the poet would turn abruptly from the description of the swallows in the Temple to what looks like a description of a real journey, with a locality, or at all events a district, which was well known, introduced by its proper name, and yet intend only a figurative reference. On the other hand, it is quite in the Hebrew manner to mix up the ideal with the actual, and to present the spiritual side by side with the literal. We have, then, here recorded the actual experience of a pilgrim's route. But quite naturally and correctly has the world seen in it a description of the pilgrimage of life, and drawn from it many a sweet and consoling lesson.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Blessed is the man.</span>--Or collective, <span class= "ital">men, </span>as the suffix, <span class= "ital">their </span>hearts, shows.<p><span class= "bld">Ways.</span>--From a root meaning <span class= "ital">to cast up</span>--and so <span class= "ital">highways </span>marked by the heaps of stone piled up at the side (<a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm" title="And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.">Isaiah 57:14</a>). In <a href="/jeremiah/18-15.htm" title="Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;">Jeremiah 18:15</a> mere <span class= "ital">footways </span>or <span class= "ital">bypaths </span>are contrasted, and so the <span class= "ital">highway </span>lends itself as a metaphor <span class= "ital">for the way of peace and righteousness </span>(<a href="/proverbs/12-28.htm" title="In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.">Proverbs 12:28</a>), as it is taken here by the Chaldee and some modern expositors.
