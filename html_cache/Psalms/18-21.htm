In the context of ancient Israel, "the ways of the LORD" would refer to the laws given through Moses, which were central to the covenant relationship between God and His people. The psalmist's declaration of faithfulness can be seen as a reflection of the covenantal promise found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. This commitment is also echoed in the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly kept the ways of the Lord, fulfilling the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and have not wickedly departed from my God.</b><br>The phrase highlights the psalmist's steadfastness in maintaining a relationship with God, avoiding the path of wickedness. In the historical context, Israel often struggled with idolatry and turning away from God, as seen in the narratives of the Judges and Kings. The psalmist's assertion contrasts with the frequent apostasy of the Israelites, serving as a personal testimony of faithfulness. This steadfastness is a type of Christ, who remained sinless and obedient to the Father, even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). The phrase also connects to the New Testament exhortation for believers to remain in Christ and not be led astray by false teachings (1 <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his devotion and faithfulness to God.

It is observed that the word translated by "departed wickedly" implies "wilful and persistent wickedness" ('Speaker's Commentary') - "an entire alienation from God" (Calvin). Not even in the humblest of the penitential psalms, when David is bewailing his great offence, does he use this verb of himself. He is an example to all men not to indulge in a false humility, nor employ phrases concerning himself which go beyond the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/18-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have kept</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1453;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8104.htm">Strong's 8104: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hedge about, guard, to protect, attend to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(dar&#183;&#7733;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
