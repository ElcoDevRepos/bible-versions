In biblical context, affliction often serves as a tool for correction or growth. The Israelites frequently experienced affliction as a result of straying from God's commandments, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges. Affliction can be seen as a form of divine discipline, intended to bring about repentance and a return to God. <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> states, "For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives," highlighting the purpose of affliction in the believer's life.<p><b>I went astray</b><br>Going astray implies a deviation from God's path or commandments. This is a common theme throughout Scripture, where God's people often turn away from His laws and suffer the consequences. The parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a> illustrates God's desire to bring back those who have gone astray. The concept of straying is also linked to the human condition of sinfulness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned&#8212;every one&#8212;to his own way."<p><b>but now I keep Your word</b><br>This phrase indicates a transformation or change in behavior following affliction. Keeping God's word is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing obedience and adherence to His commandments. The psalmist's commitment to keeping God's word reflects a heart that has been corrected and realigned with God's will. This transformation can be seen as a type of repentance, where the individual turns away from sin and towards God. Jesus Christ, in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, says, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments," underscoring the importance of obedience as an expression of love and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love for God's law and a desire for spiritual growth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being to whom the psalmist is speaking, seeking guidance, correction, and understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/affliction.htm">Affliction</a></b><br>The period of suffering or hardship that the psalmist refers to, which serves as a turning point in his spiritual journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often seen as the collective recipient of God's laws and teachings, frequently experiencing cycles of straying and returning to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_god.htm">The Word of God</a></b><br>The divine instructions, commandments, and teachings that the psalmist commits to following after experiencing affliction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_affliction.htm">The Purpose of Affliction</a></b><br>Affliction serves as a divine tool for correction and realignment with God's will.
