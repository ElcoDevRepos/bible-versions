In the Old Testament, thanksgiving is often associated with worship and sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>). The Hebrew word for "thanks" is "yadah," which implies a public acknowledgment of God's goodness and mercy. This act of giving thanks is not just a personal expression but a communal one, reflecting the collective memory of God's faithfulness to Israel. The Psalms frequently call the people to remember God's past deeds as a basis for present gratitude (Psalm 136).<p><b>Call upon His name</b><br>Calling upon the name of the LORD signifies invoking His presence and power. In ancient Israel, a name was more than a label; it represented the character and essence of a person. To call upon God's name is to seek His intervention and to trust in His covenant promises. This practice is rooted in the patriarchal narratives, where figures like Abraham and Isaac built altars and called on the name of the LORD (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 26</a>:25). It is an act of faith and reliance on God's revealed character, as seen in His names such as Yahweh, Elohim, and Adonai.<p><b>Make known His deeds among the nations</b><br>This phrase highlights the missional aspect of Israel's faith. God's deeds, particularly His acts of deliverance and provision, are to be proclaimed beyond the borders of Israel. This reflects the Abrahamic covenant, where God promises that through Abraham's descendants, all nations will be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The historical context includes Israel's deliverance from Egypt, a foundational event that demonstrated God's power and faithfulness. The call to make known His deeds anticipates the New Testament mission to spread the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). It also points to the eschatological vision where all nations will worship the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is the central figure in this Psalm.
