This gesture is associated with God's authority and power, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>, where God swears to give the land to the Israelites. It underscores the seriousness of God's intentions and His commitment to His word.<p><b>and swore</b><br>Swearing an oath in the biblical context is a binding promise, often invoking God's name as a witness. In <a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-30</a>, God swears that the disobedient generation of Israelites will not enter the Promised Land. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience.<p><b>to cast them down in the wilderness</b><br>This phrase refers to the consequence of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith during their journey from Egypt to Canaan. The wilderness represents a place of testing and judgment. Historically, this period is marked by the Israelites' wandering for 40 years, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-35</a>. Theologically, it serves as a warning against unbelief and disobedience, echoed in <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>, which uses this event as a cautionary example for Christians.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who is depicted as raising His hand in an oath, demonstrating His authority and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the judgment is directed.
