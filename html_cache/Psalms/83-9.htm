The Midianites were oppressors of Israel, and God delivered them into Gideon's hands with a small army of 300 men, emphasizing divine intervention over human strength. This victory is a testament to God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people. The Midianites' defeat serves as a reminder of God's ability to overcome overwhelming odds, reinforcing the theme of divine justice and protection.<p><b>as to Sisera and Jabin</b><br>Sisera was the commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor, as detailed in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-5</a>. Deborah, a prophetess and judge, along with Barak, led Israel to victory against them. Sisera's defeat was marked by his death at the hands of Jael, a woman, which was unexpected and humiliating for a military leader. This event highlights God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises through unexpected means. Jabin's defeat symbolizes the end of Canaanite oppression and the restoration of peace for Israel.<p><b>at the River Kishon</b><br>The River Kishon is a significant geographical location in the narrative of Sisera's defeat. It is where the Canaanite forces were overwhelmed by a sudden flood, as described in <a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>. This natural phenomenon is seen as an act of God, aiding Israel's victory. The Kishon River's role in the battle underscores the theme of God's control over nature and His ability to use it to accomplish His purposes. This event is a powerful reminder of God's intervention in history to deliver His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that often opposed Israel.

The psalmist is not proposing personal revenge but entrusting judgment to God, just as <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> urges believers to leave room for His wrath. By invoking God&#8217;s past acts, the writer builds faith that the same God who defended Israel before will defend her now (see <a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-1.htm">Psalm 35:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>Key ideas:<p>&#8226; The petition is rooted in confidence that God&#8217;s character never changes (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Bringing God&#8217;s previous victories into present prayer reinforces trust and reminds listeners of His proven faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase carries an implicit recognition that ultimate justice lies with the Lord, not human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as You did to Midian</b><p>Midian&#8217;s defeat under Gideon (<a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6&#8211;8</a>) stands as a classic example of God turning impossible odds into triumph.
