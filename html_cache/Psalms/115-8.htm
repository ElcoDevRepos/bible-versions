In the context of ancient Israel, idol-making was a common practice among surrounding nations. These idols, often crafted from wood, stone, or metal, were lifeless and powerless. The Bible frequently condemns idolatry, emphasizing that idols have no breath or life in them (<a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14-15</a>). The makers of idols, by investing their time and devotion into these lifeless objects, become spiritually dull and lifeless themselves. This reflects the biblical theme that worship shapes character, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-23</a>, where turning away from God leads to futile thinking and darkened hearts.<p><b>as do all who trust in them</b><br>Trusting in idols, or anything other than the one true God, leads to spiritual blindness and a lack of discernment. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel is warned against adopting the idolatrous practices of other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>). The prophets often spoke against the futility of idol worship, as in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the absurdity of worshipping man-made objects is mocked. Trusting in idols results in a separation from God, as seen in the history of Israel's repeated cycles of idolatry and subsequent judgment. This phrase serves as a warning that misplaced trust leads to spiritual stagnation and ultimately, judgment, as echoed in the New Testament in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>, which urges believers to flee from idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another Israelite leader, who is addressing the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idol_makers.htm">Idol Makers</a></b><br>Individuals or groups who create idols, often representing false gods, which are the focus of this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is directed, often struggling with idolatry and the temptation to follow the practices of surrounding nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made by human hands, often representing deities of other cultures, which are powerless and lifeless.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god.htm">Trust in God</a></b><br>The central theme of the Psalm, contrasting the futility of idol worship with the power and faithfulness of the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_idolatry.htm">The Nature of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

The crafts&#173;man who shapes such lifeless images is choosing to invest skill, energy, and affection in an object that can never respond. Scripture repeatedly exposes this futility:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-17</a> shows a carpenter cutting down a tree, burning half for fuel, then worshiping the other half&#8212;&#8220;Shall I bow to a block of wood?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a> warns, &#8220;You shall not make for yourself an idol,&#8221; placing the maker already on disobedient ground.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22-23</a> describes people who &#8220;exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images,&#8221; revealing that intellectual brilliance cannot protect a heart that willingly forms false gods.<p>By making an idol, a person signals an inward departure from the living Lord to the dead works of his own hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>become like them</b><p>The chilling result is likeness. Idols cannot hear prayer, feel compassion, guide, or save; and the crafter mirrors that impotence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a> puts it plainly: &#8220;They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> echoes, &#8220;They followed idols and became idolaters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Contrast this with <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>, where beholding the glory of the Lord transforms believers &#8220;into His image.&#8221; We resemble what we revere.<p>In practical terms:<p>&#8211; Hearts grow unresponsive to God&#8217;s voice, as deaf as the statue&#8217;s ears.<p>&#8211; Spiritual vision dims, matching the idol&#8217;s blind eyes.<p>&#8211; Moral paralysis sets in; idols cannot move, and neither can the conscience of the one molded after them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as do all who trust in them</b><p>The verdict stretches beyond artisans to every devotee. Trust, not just craftsmanship, seals the likeness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a> warns, &#8220;Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18</a> repeats the same principle, &#8220;Those who make them will be like them, as will all who trust in them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a> closes the apostolic witness with &#8220;Little children, keep yourselves from idols,&#8221; underscoring that New-Covenant believers are not immune.<p>Whenever security or identity is shifted from the Lord to money, status, pleasure, or any created thing, that object slowly stamps its dead image on the soul. Only trust in the living God brings life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a> teaches a sobering spiritual law: we become what we worship. The craftsman who shapes an idol, and the worshiper who relies on it, both end up as lifeless, senseless, and powerless as the object of their devotion. In contrast, trusting the living Lord fills a person with His life, alertness, and power. Choosing the right object of trust is therefore the decisive issue of every heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/115.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Every one that trusteth . . .</span>--<p>"Who moulds in gold or stone a sacred face<p>Makes not the god; but he who asks his grace."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/115.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that make them are like unto them.</span> Equally vain, futile, and power less (comp. <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So is every one that trusteth in them.</span> To "trust" in an idol is an almost inconceivable folly.
