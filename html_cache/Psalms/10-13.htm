The act of renouncing God indicates a deliberate rejection of divine authority and moral order. In biblical context, renouncing God is seen as a grave sin, often leading to judgment. This question echoes the lament found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the success of the wicked. The renunciation of God by the wicked is a denial of His sovereignty and justice, which is a recurring issue throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the prophetic books where Israel is often called to account for similar attitudes.<p><b>He says to himself, &#8220;You will never call me to account.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reveals the inner thoughts and arrogance of the wicked, who believe they can act without consequence. The belief that God will not call them to account reflects a misunderstanding or denial of God's omniscience and justice. This attitude is reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where doubt is cast on God's word and judgment. Theologically, this reflects a lack of fear of the Lord, which is considered the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The idea of divine accountability is a central theme in scripture, with numerous passages affirming that God will judge the actions of all people (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the final judgment described in Revelation, where all will be held accountable before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents those who live in defiance of God, often characterized by arrogance and a lack of accountability.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign and just deity who is often questioned by the wicked but remains the ultimate judge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, who is lamenting the apparent success and arrogance of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrogance_of_the_wicked.htm">The Arrogance of the Wicked</a></b><br>The wicked man's denial of accountability is rooted in arrogance.
