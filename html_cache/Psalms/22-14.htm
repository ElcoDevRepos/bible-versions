In biblical times, water was a symbol of life and vitality, yet here it represents the psalmist's feeling of being drained and powerless. This imagery is prophetic, foreshadowing the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross, as described in the Gospels. The pouring out of water can also be seen as a metaphor for the shedding of blood, which is central to the atonement theology in Christianity. The expression of being "poured out" is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, where Paul speaks of being poured out as a drink offering, indicating total surrender and sacrifice.<p><b>and all my bones are disjointed</b><br>This phrase suggests intense physical agony and distress. In the context of crucifixion, a method of execution used by the Romans, the victim's body would indeed experience dislocation of joints due to the weight and position on the cross. This vivid description aligns with the accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, where His physical suffering is emphasized. The disjointing of bones can also symbolize a sense of being broken and scattered, reflecting the psalmist's emotional and spiritual turmoil. This imagery is consistent with the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which is often interpreted as a prophecy of Christ's passion.<p><b>My heart is like wax;</b><br>The heart, in biblical literature, often represents the center of emotions and will. Describing the heart as "like wax" suggests a state of extreme emotional distress and weakness. Wax, when exposed to heat, melts and loses its form, symbolizing the psalmist's inner turmoil and despair. This imagery can be connected to the emotional and spiritual anguish Jesus experienced in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, as He bore the weight of humanity's sins. The melting heart also reflects a sense of vulnerability and surrender to God's will, as seen in Jesus' prayer, "Not my will, but yours be done" (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>).<p><b>it melts away within me</b><br>This phrase continues the metaphor of the heart as wax, emphasizing the complete dissolution of strength and resolve. The internal melting signifies a profound sense of hopelessness and abandonment, resonating with Jesus' cry on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), which directly quotes the opening of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. The melting away can also be seen as a purification process, where the psalmist's suffering leads to a deeper reliance on God. This transformative aspect of suffering is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where trials are seen as a means to spiritual growth and refinement (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing deep anguish and distress, which is both personal and prophetic.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>This psalm is often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of the suffering of Jesus Christ, particularly His crucifixion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion.htm">Crucifixion</a></b><br>The events described in <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> closely parallel the crucifixion of Jesus, making it a significant messianic psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>The psalmist's vivid imagery of suffering ("poured out like water") helps us understand the depth of human anguish and the reality of Jesus' suffering on the cross.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Recognize the prophetic nature of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> as it points to the crucifixion of Jesus, affirming the reliability and divine inspiration of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/emotional_honesty_in_prayer.htm">Emotional Honesty in Prayer</a></b><br>David's raw expression of distress encourages believers to be honest with God about their own struggles and emotions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_despair.htm">Hope in Despair</a></b><br>Despite the intense suffering described, the psalm ultimately points to deliverance and hope, reminding us that God is present even in our darkest moments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_empathy.htm">Christ's Empathy</a></b><br>Jesus' fulfillment of this psalm assures us that He fully understands human suffering and can empathize with our weaknesses.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_22_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 22:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_22_14_and_Christ_s_crucifixion_link.htm">How does Psalm 22:14 foreshadow Christ's suffering on the cross?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_poured_out_reveal_about_Jesus.htm">What does "poured out like water" reveal about Jesus' emotional state?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_22_14_enhance_Christ_s_sacrifice.htm">How can understanding Psalm 22:14 deepen our appreciation for Christ's sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Christ_s_endurance_empower_us.htm">In what ways can we find strength in Christ's endurance during our trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_22_14_to_Isaiah_53_12_prophecy.htm">How does Psalm 22:14 connect with the prophecy in Isaiah 53:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_22_14_s_link_to_Jesus_crucifixion.htm">How does Psalm 22:14 foreshadow the crucifixion of Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_imagery_in_Psalm_22_14_important.htm">What is the significance of the imagery in Psalm 22:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_22_14_s_link_to_biblical_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 22:14 relate to the theme of suffering in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_feel_forsaken_by_god.htm">Why did Jesus feel forsaken by God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_mental_illness.htm">What does the Bible say about mental illness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_suffer_greatly.htm">Why did Jesus endure extensive suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_james_5_9_with_lament_psalms.htm">In James 5:9, how can believers reconcile the warning against grumbling with other biblical passages that encourage honest lament or complaint (e.g., in the Psalms)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 22:14 Mean</div><b>I am poured out like water</b><p>- David describes a total draining of life and strength.

The comparison highlights literal cardiovascular stress and emotional overload.<p>- God allows such melting so that dependence shifts from self-strength to His sustaining power (<a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it melts away within me</b><p>- The final clause shows complete internal dissolution: courage, strength, and hope appear to be liquefying.
