Asaph was a prominent Levite musician appointed by King David, and several psalms are attributed to him or his descendants. This indicates the psalm's purpose as a teaching tool, possibly reflecting on Israel's history and God's dealings with His people.<p><b>Why have You rejected us forever, O God?</b><br>This phrase reflects a deep sense of abandonment and distress. Historically, this could be linked to events such as the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites felt forsaken due to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. Theologically, it expresses the feeling of divine rejection, a theme also seen in Lamentations. It raises questions about God's covenant promises, echoing the cries of other biblical figures who felt abandoned, such as Job.<p><b>Why does Your anger smolder against the sheep of Your pasture?</b><br>The imagery of "sheep" and "pasture" is pastoral, reflecting the relationship between God and His people as a shepherd to his flock, a common biblical metaphor. This phrase suggests a prolonged period of divine displeasure, possibly due to Israel's sin and idolatry. It connects to passages like <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God promises to be the true shepherd of Israel. The smoldering anger implies ongoing judgment, yet the shepherd imagery also hints at hope for restoration and care, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is addressed directly by the psalmist, expressing a deep sense of abandonment and seeking understanding of His anger.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Likely Asaph or a descendant of Asaph, who is expressing a communal lament on behalf of Israel, feeling rejected by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep_of_your_pasture.htm">The Sheep of Your Pasture</a></b><br>This metaphor refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen people, who are seen as His flock under His care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation experiencing distress and feeling the weight of God's anger, possibly during a time of national crisis or exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_and_anger.htm">Rejection and Anger</a></b><br>The emotional and spiritual state of the relationship between God and Israel, characterized by feelings of divine rejection and anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_discipline.htm">Understanding Divine Discipline</a></b><br>God's anger and rejection are often responses to sin and disobedience.

He and his descendants were prophets in song (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>).<p>- Knowing that an experienced worship leader pens this lament reminds us that even mature believers sometimes wrestle aloud with God, though never outside His sovereign care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why have You rejected us forever, O God?</b><p>- The question sounds final, yet the psalmist is voicing perception, not settled doctrine; he is processing calamity in prayer.<p>&#8226; Similar cries appear in <a href="/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a> and <a href="/lamentations/5-20.htm">Lamentations 5:20</a>, proving that honest lament has scriptural precedent.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a> answers the fear head-on: &#8220;Has God rejected His people? By no means!&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant devotion remains.<p>- The catastrophe behind <a href="/bsb/psalms/74.htm">Psalm 74</a> likely involves the temple&#8217;s destruction (echoed in verses 3&#8211;8), a severe but not permanent discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>- Discipline, though painful, confirms sonship (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The psalm teaches us to interpret hardship through covenant lenses rather than despair.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why does Your anger smolder against the sheep of Your pasture?</b><p>- Calling the nation &#8220;sheep&#8221; recalls <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; even under wrath they are still His flock.<p>- &#8220;Smolder&#8221; suggests controlled, sustained anger&#8212;divine patience that waits for repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger burned against Israel because of chronic idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>), yet His shepherd-heart never ceased (<a href="/psalms/79-13.htm">Psalm 79:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a> promises restored shepherding; the same heart underlies this lament.<p>- Bullet points on what smoldering anger accomplishes:<p>&#8226; Exposes sin that complacency hides (<a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Drives the people back to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; Sets the stage for ultimate reconciliation in Christ, who bears wrath for the flock (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/john/10-15.htm">John 10:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a> captures a seasoned worshiper&#8217;s anguish when covenant discipline falls. The inspired heading tells us the psalm is meant to teach; the piercing questions model how to bring raw confusion to the Lord without forfeiting faith. God&#8217;s seeming rejection is temporary correction, not final abandonment, and His smoldering anger is the refining fire of a Shepherd determined to restore His flock. The verse invites believers in every age to confront calamity honestly, remember God&#8217;s unbreakable promises, and run to the Savior who ultimately absorbs divine wrath and gathers His sheep forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/74.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Why hast . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">why hast thou never ceased abandoning us?</span><p><span class= "bld">Anger.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">nostril, </span>as in <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm" title="There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.">Psalm 18:8</a>, "there went a smoke from his nostril."<p><span class= "bld">The sheep of thy pasture.</span>--An expression peculiar to the Asaphic psalms and <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:1</a>.<p>THE misery of the Jews is here at its deepest (Four Friends, p. 291). The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into "perpetual ruins" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to "make havoc" of Israel "altogether;" and the enemy have spread themselves, and "burnt up all the houses of God in the land" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the time of the invasion of Shishak; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of the Babylonian conquest;
