In the context of <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, which recounts Israel's history and their repeated disobedience, this action reflects God's righteous response to sin. The imagery of "clearing a path" suggests removing obstacles to allow His wrath to proceed unhindered. This can be connected to the Exodus narrative, where God&#8217;s judgments against Egypt were both a demonstration of His power and a means to deliver His people (Exodus 7-12). Theologically, it underscores the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate sin indefinitely. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness.<p><b>He did not spare them from death</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of God's judgment. In the historical context of the plagues in Egypt, God did not spare the Egyptians from the consequences of their actions, particularly Pharaoh's hardened heart (<a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4-6</a>). Theologically, it serves as a sobering reminder of the wages of sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The sparing of the Israelites during the Passover, when the blood of the lamb protected them from the angel of death, is a type of Christ, whose sacrifice spares believers from eternal death (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>but delivered their lives to the plague.</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the specific judgment of the plagues, particularly the final plague of the death of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-30</a>). The term "delivered" suggests a handing over to judgment, emphasizing God's control over life and death. In a broader biblical context, plagues are often seen as instruments of divine judgment (Revelation 16). Theologically, this reflects the justice of God, who uses such means to bring about repentance and acknowledgment of His sovereignty. The plagues also serve as a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who bore the plague of sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His righteous judgment and sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's actions, experiencing both His deliverance and His discipline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the plagues occurred, representing opposition to God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>Specific events used by God to execute judgment and demonstrate His power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Though not mentioned in this specific verse, they were key leaders during the time of the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's actions are always just, even when they involve severe measures like plagues.
