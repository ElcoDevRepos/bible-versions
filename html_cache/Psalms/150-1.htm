It is a call to worship and an expression of joy and reverence. This exclamation is used frequently in the Psalms, emphasizing the importance of praise in the life of a believer. The use of "Hallelujah" connects to the worship practices of ancient Israel, where music and song were integral to temple worship. It also foreshadows the heavenly worship described in Revelation, where the multitude praises God with "Hallelujah" (<a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19:1-6</a>).<p><b>Praise God in His sanctuary.</b><br>The "sanctuary" refers to the holy place where God's presence dwells. In the context of ancient Israel, this would have been the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem. The sanctuary was the center of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. This phrase calls believers to worship God in the designated holy places, acknowledging His holiness and sovereignty. It also points to the New Testament understanding of the believer's body as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), expanding the concept of sanctuary to include the personal and communal life of Christians.<p><b>Praise Him in His mighty heavens.</b><br>The "mighty heavens" refers to the expanse of the sky and the celestial realm, highlighting God's sovereignty over all creation. This phrase invites worship not only in earthly sanctuaries but also in the vastness of the heavens, suggesting that all of creation is a testament to God's power and majesty. The heavens declare the glory of God (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>), and this call to praise extends to the angelic hosts and all heavenly beings. It underscores the universal scope of worship, where both the earthly and heavenly realms join in adoration of the Creator. This also anticipates the eschatological vision where heaven and earth unite in worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure of worship and praise in this verse.
