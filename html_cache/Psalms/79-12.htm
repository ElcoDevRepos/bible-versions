In biblical times, the "lap" was considered a place where one received blessings or consequences, symbolizing personal accountability. The request for repayment suggests a desire for justice, aligning with the principle of divine retribution found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares vengeance is His.<p><b>sevenfold</b><br>The use of "sevenfold" signifies completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. It implies a full and complete measure of justice, reflecting the severity of the offense. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>, where God promises a sevenfold vengeance on anyone who harms Cain, indicating a comprehensive and divine response to wrongdoing.<p><b>the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord</b><br>The reproach mentioned here is not just against the people of Israel but is seen as an affront to God Himself. This reflects the biblical understanding that offenses against God's people are offenses against God. The cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient Near East highlights the seriousness of such reproach. This idea is paralleled in the New Testament, where Jesus identifies with His followers, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>, when He asks Saul why he is persecuting Him, equating the persecution of Christians with persecution of Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/79.htm">Psalm 79</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court, known for his role in temple worship and his contributions to the Psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are experiencing devastation and seeking divine justice against their enemies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations that have attacked and reproached Israel, mocking their God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem that has been defiled by foreign invaders, a central theme of lament in this Psalm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is called upon to act in justice and restore His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>The psalmist's plea for a sevenfold repayment reflects a desire for complete and perfect justice, rooted in the Hebrew concept of "shalam," meaning to make whole or complete.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_reputation.htm">God's Reputation</a></b><br>The reproach hurled at God by the enemies is a serious offense, highlighting the importance of God's honor and reputation among the nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_in_distress.htm">Prayer in Distress</a></b><br>In times of national or personal crisis, believers are encouraged to turn to God in prayer, seeking His intervention and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>While the psalmist calls for immediate retribution, believers are reminded to trust in God's perfect timing and wisdom in dealing with injustice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_vengeance.htm">Forgiveness and Vengeance</a></b><br>While the psalmist seeks vengeance, Christians are called to forgive and leave vengeance to God, as taught in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_79_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 79:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_justice_in_life.htm">How can we seek God's justice like in Psalm 79:12 in our lives?
