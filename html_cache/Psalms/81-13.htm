Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly calls Israel to listen and obey (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). Listening in the biblical sense implies not just hearing but also acting upon God's commands. The lament here suggests a history of disobedience and rebellion, as seen in the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 32) and the period of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where listening is a key component of faithfulness. It also echoes the Shema, a central declaration of faith in Judaism, emphasizing the importance of hearing and obeying God.<p><b>if Israel would follow My ways</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the path of righteousness that God has set for His people. "My ways" refers to the laws and commandments given to Israel, which are meant to guide them in living a life that reflects God's holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The historical context includes the giving of the Law at Sinai (Exodus 20) and the repeated calls to follow God's statutes (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). The phrase suggests a conditional promise, where blessings follow obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). It also points to the prophetic hope of a future restoration when Israel will fully follow God's ways (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). In a typological sense, Jesus Christ embodies the perfect fulfillment of God's ways, and through Him, believers are empowered to walk in obedience (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, <a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing a desire for His people to listen and follow His ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, representing the nation that God is addressing in this Psalm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a>, a Levite and one of David's chief musicians, who composed this psalm as a call to worship and obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place from which God delivered the Israelites, referenced earlier in the Psalm as a reminder of God's past faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_trumpets.htm">Feast of Trumpets</a></b><br>The event during which this Psalm was likely sung, a time of gathering and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_god.htm">The Heart of God</a></b><br>God deeply desires a relationship with His people, characterized by listening and obedience.
