In the historical context of ancient building practices, builders would carefully select stones for their projects, and any stone that did not meet their standards would be discarded. This imagery is used metaphorically to describe how Jesus Christ was rejected by the religious leaders of His time, the "builders" of the Jewish faith. Despite His rejection, He was chosen by God for a pivotal role. This rejection is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels and Acts, where Jesus is often depicted as being rejected by the Jewish authorities (e.g., <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>).<p><b>has become the cornerstone</b><br>The cornerstone is the foundational stone in a building, crucial for the structure's stability and alignment. In ancient architecture, the cornerstone was the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation, and all other stones were set in reference to it. This phrase signifies that Jesus, though rejected, has become the essential foundation of the Church. This transformation from rejection to foundational importance is a fulfillment of prophecy and is central to Christian theology. The New Testament frequently references Jesus as the cornerstone, emphasizing His role as the foundation of faith and the Church (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>). This concept also ties into the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament, where the Messiah is depicted as a stone that would be both a stumbling block and a foundation (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_builders.htm">The Builders</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the leaders and people of Israel who rejected Jesus as the Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who was rejected by the religious leaders but chosen by God to be the foundation of salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cornerstone.htm">The Cornerstone</a></b><br>In ancient construction, the cornerstone was the principal stone, often the largest and most solid, placed at the corner of a building to guide the construction of the entire structure.
