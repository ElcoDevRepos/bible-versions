It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, emphasizing human insignificance compared to God's majesty. The term "man" here refers to humanity in general, highlighting our frailty and mortality. The Hebrew word for "man" is "enosh," often used to denote human weakness. This phrase invites reflection on God's grace and mercy, as He chooses to engage with His creation despite our limitations. It underscores the biblical theme of God's condescension and care, as seen in His covenant relationships throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>the son of man that You think of him?</b><br>"Son of man" is a Hebrew idiom for human beings, emphasizing our earthly nature. This phrase is significant in biblical literature, often used to denote human frailty and dependence on God. In the New Testament, "Son of Man" becomes a title for Jesus Christ, highlighting His identification with humanity and His role as the representative human. The phrase "that You think of him" suggests God's mindfulness and intentionality in His relationship with humanity. It points to the biblical narrative of God's ongoing involvement with His creation, from the calling of Abraham to the incarnation of Christ. This reflects the theological concept of God's providence and His intimate knowledge of each person, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a> and <a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a warrior and poet.
