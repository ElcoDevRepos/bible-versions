Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a warrior who fights on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The imagery of enemies retreating suggests a complete and decisive victory, often attributed to God's power rather than human strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>). Historically, David faced numerous adversaries, including Saul and various foreign nations, and his victories were seen as evidence of God's favor and covenantal promises to Israel. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who through His death and resurrection, defeated the ultimate enemies of sin and death, causing them to retreat before His power (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>).<p><b>I destroyed those who hated me.</b><br>The destruction of enemies in this context is not merely personal vengeance but is often understood as the execution of divine justice. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were seen as representatives of their gods, and their victories were considered acts of divine judgment. David's role as king included the responsibility to uphold justice and righteousness, which sometimes involved the destruction of those who opposed God's purposes (<a href="/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's ultimate judgment against evil, as seen in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>). In a typological sense, this can be related to Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where He will destroy all forces that oppose God's kingdom (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing gratitude to God for delivering him from his enemies.
