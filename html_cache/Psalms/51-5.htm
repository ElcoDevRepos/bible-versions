The psalmist, King David, acknowledges his sinful nature, which aligns with the biblical teaching that all humans inherit a sinful nature due to the fall of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3). This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, where Paul explains that sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, affecting all humanity. The use of "brought forth" indicates the moment of birth, emphasizing that sinfulness is not just a result of actions but a condition present from the beginning of life.<p><b>I was sinful when my mother conceived me.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the idea that sinfulness is present even at conception, reinforcing the depth of human depravity. It highlights the belief that sin is not merely a result of external actions but is an intrinsic part of human nature. This aligns with <a href="/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>, which questions how anyone born of a woman can be pure. The reference to conception also points to the need for divine intervention for redemption, foreshadowing the necessity of Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice.

It has been hitherto for the first step in justification - the wiping out of past transgressions. It is now for restoration, for a renewal of spiritual life, for a return to God's favour, and to the spiritual joy involved in it. First, however, an additional confession is made (vers. 5, 6). Not only have I committed acts of sin (vers. 1-4), but sin is thoroughly ingrained into my nature. I was conceived in it; I was brought forth in it; only the strongest remedies can cleanse me from it (ver. 7). But cleansing alone is not enough. I need renewal (ver. 10); I need thy Holy Spirit (ver. 11); I crave, above all, the sense of a restoration to thy favour - a return to the old feelings of "joy and gladness" (ver. 8), even "the joy of thy salvation" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in iniquity was I brought forth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And in sin did my</span> <span class="cmt_word">mother conceive me.</span> It is doubtless true, as Professor Cheyne says, that "the Old Testament contains no theory of the origin of sin" - no formulated doctrine on the subject.
