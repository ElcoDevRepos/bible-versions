Singing was a way to express joy, gratitude, and reverence to God. The Psalms, often referred to as the hymnbook of Israel, were used in temple worship and personal devotion. Singing to the LORD is a call to acknowledge His sovereignty and goodness. In the New Testament, <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a> encourage believers to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, continuing this tradition of musical worship.<p><b>Bless His name</b><br>To bless God's name is to speak well of Him, acknowledging His character and deeds. In Hebrew culture, a name represented the essence of a person. Thus, blessing God's name is an act of worship that recognizes His holiness, power, and love. This practice is seen throughout the Psalms and is echoed in the Lord's Prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>, where Jesus teaches His disciples to hallow God's name. It reflects a heart of gratitude and reverence.<p><b>Proclaim His salvation</b><br>Proclaiming salvation involves declaring the deliverance and redemption that God provides. In the Old Testament, this often referred to physical deliverance from enemies or oppression. However, it also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, as seen in the New Testament. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> emphasizes that salvation is found in no one else but Jesus. This proclamation is a call to evangelism, sharing the good news of God's saving grace with others.<p><b>Day after day</b><br>The phrase "day after day" suggests a continual, ongoing action. Worship and proclamation are not meant to be occasional but a regular part of a believer's life. This reflects the biblical principle of daily devotion and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which speaks of God's mercies being new every morning. It encourages believers to maintain a consistent relationship with God, continually acknowledging His presence and work in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is worthy of worship and praise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to King David, who calls the people to worship and proclaim God's salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the psalm was originally addressed, called to be a light to the nations through their worship and testimony.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Implicit in the call to proclaim God's salvation, indicating the universal scope of God's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The deliverance and redemption offered by God, a central theme in the psalm and throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_worship.htm">The Call to Worship</a></b><br>Worship is not just a personal act but a communal and public declaration of God's greatness.<br><br>Singing to the LORD is a way to bless His name and acknowledge His attributes and deeds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_salvation.htm">Proclaiming Salvation</a></b><br>Believers are called to share the message of salvation consistently, "day after day."<br><br>This proclamation is both a privilege and a responsibility, reflecting God's desire for all to know Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>Sharing personal experiences of God's salvation can be a powerful witness to others.<br><br>Testimonies should focus on God's work and character, not just personal benefits.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_faith.htm">Consistency in Faith</a></b><br>Daily proclamation requires a consistent and growing relationship with God.<br><br>Spiritual disciplines such as prayer, Bible study, and fellowship support this consistency.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_perspective.htm">Global Perspective</a></b><br>God's salvation is for all nations, and believers are part of a global mission.<br><br>Engaging in missions and supporting global evangelism efforts align with the psalmist's vision.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_96_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 96:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_share_His_salvation_daily.htm">How can we "proclaim His salvation" daily in our modern lives?

In <a href="/psalms/147-1.htm">Psalm 147:1</a> we read, &#8220;Hallelujah! How good it is to sing praises to our God, for praise is pleasant and lovely.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The New Testament carries the same theme: &#8220;Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Song unites believers across generations and locations, turning individual praise into a chorus that magnifies the Lord&#8217;s greatness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bless His name</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;bless His name,&#8221; urging us to speak well of God&#8217;s character and works.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>) shows that blessing God begins internally and then overflows audibly.<p>&#8226; To bless His name means to declare His attributes&#8212;holiness, mercy, justice, love&#8212;without dilution. <a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a> models this: &#8220;I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; stands for His revealed person. Each time we bless His name we affirm His unchanging nature and invite others to recognize His worth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Proclaim His salvation day after day</b><p>Finally, the psalm calls us to &#8220;proclaim His salvation day after day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Salvation is not a private treasure but good news to broadcast. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> affirms, &#8220;Salvation exists in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The call is continual&#8212;&#8220;day after day.&#8221; This echoes <a href="/1_chronicles/16-23.htm">1 Chronicles 16:23</a>: &#8220;Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation day after day.&#8221; Our witness is meant to be steady, not seasonal.<p>&#8226; Jesus gives the same charge: &#8220;Go and make disciples of all nations&#8230; teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical outworking:<p>&#8211; Share personal testimony of Christ&#8217;s saving work.<p>&#8211; Support missions and evangelism so the message reaches &#8220;all nations.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Live a life that consistently reflects the rescue we proclaim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/96-2.htm">Psalm 96:2</a> layers three inseparable actions: sing, bless, and proclaim. Genuine worship (singing) flows into heartfelt praise (blessing His name) and overflows into daily witness (proclaiming salvation). Embracing all three keeps our focus on the Lord, honors His unchanging character, and faithfully spreads the good news of His saving work to a world that needs to hear it&#8212;day after day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/96.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord, bless his Name</span> (cf. <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>;
