Throughout their history, the Israelites often professed loyalty to God verbally, but their actions did not align with their words. This behavior is reminiscent of the warning in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God laments that the people honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. The act of deception here is not just a failure in communication but a deeper spiritual issue, reflecting a lack of true faith and commitment. This theme of hypocrisy is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for similar behavior (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><b>and lied to Him with their tongues</b><br>The use of "lied" underscores the deliberate nature of their falsehoods. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, truthfulness was a covenantal obligation, and lying was a serious breach of trust. The Israelites' lies to God can be seen as a violation of the covenant established at Sinai, where they promised to obey God's commands (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>). This breach is not just a personal failing but a communal one, affecting their relationship with God and their standing as His chosen people.
