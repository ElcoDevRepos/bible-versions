The "great assembly" refers to a large gathering of worshippers, likely in the temple in Jerusalem. This setting underscores the importance of communal worship in ancient Israelite culture. The act of proclaiming righteousness aligns with the prophetic tradition, where prophets often spoke God's truth to the people. This public declaration can be seen as a type of Christ, who also proclaimed righteousness and truth to the multitudes (e.g., the Sermon on the Mount in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5-7</a>). The emphasis on righteousness connects to the broader biblical theme of God's justice and moral order, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61-11.htm">Isaiah 61:11</a>.<p><b>behold, I do not seal my lips,</b><br>The psalmist emphasizes his willingness to speak openly about God's righteousness. In biblical times, sealing one's lips could symbolize silence or withholding truth. This phrase suggests a boldness and readiness to share God's message, reminiscent of the apostles in <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>, who declared they could not help speaking about what they had seen and heard. The refusal to remain silent is a call to believers to be vocal about their faith and God's works, reflecting the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>as You, O LORD, do know.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's omniscience, affirming that the Lord is aware of the psalmist's actions and intentions. It reflects a personal relationship with God, where the psalmist is confident that God knows his heart and his commitment to proclaiming righteousness. This assurance of God's knowledge is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, which speaks of God's intimate understanding of each person. It also serves as a reminder that God is the ultimate judge of sincerity and truth in one's declarations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a>, David is expressing his commitment to proclaiming God's righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_assembly.htm">The Great Assembly</a></b><br>This refers to a gathering of God's people, possibly in a worship setting or a public declaration among the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His relationship with His people and His role as the righteous judge and savior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_righteousness.htm">Proclaiming Righteousness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to openly declare God's righteousness and truth in our communities and churches.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_witness.htm">Boldness in Witness</a></b><br>Like David, we should not seal our lips but speak boldly about our faith and the works of God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_worship_and_testimony.htm">Public Worship and Testimony</a></b><br>Engaging in public worship and sharing testimonies can strengthen the faith of others and glorify God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_knowledge_of_our_hearts.htm">God's Knowledge of Our Hearts</a></b><br>God knows our intentions and desires, and we should strive to align our actions with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_faith.htm">Consistency in Faith</a></b><br>Our commitment to proclaiming God's righteousness should be consistent, regardless of the audience or setting.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_40_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 40:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proclaim_righteousness_daily_with_others.htm">How can we "proclaim righteousness" in our daily interactions with others?
