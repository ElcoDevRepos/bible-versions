In the biblical context, the godly are those who live in accordance with God's will and seek His guidance. Prayer is a fundamental aspect of a relationship with God, as seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>). The call to prayer here suggests a sense of urgency and necessity, highlighting the importance of maintaining a close connection with God.<p><b>while You may be found.</b><br>This implies a window of opportunity for seeking God, suggesting that there may be times when it is more difficult to find Him. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, which urges people to seek the Lord while He is near. The idea is that God's presence and willingness to be found are not to be taken for granted. It also reflects the urgency of repentance and turning to God before it is too late, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).<p><b>Surely when great waters rise,</b><br>The imagery of "great waters" often symbolizes chaos, danger, or judgment in the Bible. This can be seen in the story of Noah's flood (Genesis 6-9) and the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14). The rising waters represent overwhelming circumstances or divine judgment. In a spiritual sense, it can also refer to the trials and tribulations that believers may face in life.<p><b>they will not come near.</b><br>This assurance of protection is a common theme in the Psalms, where God is depicted as a refuge and fortress (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>, <a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7-8</a>). For the godly who seek God in prayer, there is a promise of safety and deliverance from overwhelming circumstances. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to protect and preserve those who trust in Him, as seen in the deliverance of Daniel from the lion's den (Daniel 6) and the protection of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>, David is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for his deep relationship with God, his psalms, and his reign as king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_godly.htm">The Godly</a></b><br>Refers to those who are devout and faithful to God, seeking His presence and guidance in their lives.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_waters.htm">Great Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of overwhelming troubles or adversities that can threaten one's peace and security.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_prayer.htm">The Urgency of Prayer</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking God in prayer before times of trouble arise.
