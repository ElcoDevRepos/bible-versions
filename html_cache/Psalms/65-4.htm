In the Old Testament, this is often seen in the context of the Israelites, whom God chose as His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The "courts" refer to the temple courts in Jerusalem, a place of worship and communion with God. This reflects the privilege of being in God's presence, akin to the Levites who served in the temple (<a href="/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5-7</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings believers into the presence of God through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The idea of being chosen and brought near is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>We are filled with the goodness of Your house,</b><br>The "goodness of Your house" refers to the blessings and spiritual nourishment found in God's presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the temple was not only a place of worship but also a symbol of God's provision and protection. The "house" of God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, symbolizing a place of refuge and blessing (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). This phrase can also be connected to the New Testament understanding of the church as the house of God, where believers are spiritually fed and nurtured (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). The goodness experienced in God's house is a foretaste of the eternal blessings promised to believers.<p><b>the holiness of Your temple.</b><br>The temple's holiness signifies its set-apart nature, dedicated to the worship and service of God. In the Old Testament, the temple was the central place of worship for the Israelites, where God's presence dwelt among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The holiness of the temple required purity and reverence from those who entered (<a href="/leviticus/19-30.htm">Leviticus 19:30</a>). This concept is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and in the New Testament church, where believers are called to be holy as God's temple (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>). The holiness of the temple underscores the call for believers to live lives set apart for God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chosen_one.htm">The Chosen One</a></b><br>Refers to those whom God selects to draw near to Him. This can be seen as a reference to believers who are called into a relationship with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_courts.htm">God's Courts</a></b><br>Symbolic of the place where God dwells, often associated with the temple in Jerusalem. It represents the presence of God and the privilege of being close to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_house.htm">God's House</a></b><br>Refers to the temple, a place of worship and communion with God. It signifies the spiritual blessings and abundance found in God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god's_temple.htm">The Holiness of God's Temple</a></b><br>Represents the purity and sacredness of being in God's presence. It underscores the reverence and awe due to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_selection_and_grace.htm">Divine Selection and Grace</a></b><br>God&#8217;s choice is an act of grace, not based on human merit. Believers should respond with gratitude and humility, recognizing the privilege of being chosen.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_privilege_of_nearness.htm">The Privilege of Nearness</a></b><br>Being brought near to God is a profound blessing. Christians are encouraged to cultivate a close relationship with God through prayer, worship, and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/experiencing_god's_goodness.htm">Experiencing God's Goodness</a></b><br>The goodness of God's house is available to all who seek Him.

And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. Among the peculiar privileges, one of the greatest was that of approaching God's presence in his holy temple, and entering his "courts" and worshipping there. This all Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to do, at least three times in the year, while the dwellers in Jerusalem, privileged above the rest, had constant opportunities of attending, and using to the full the means of grace provided for them in the sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. In "the goodness of God's house" the psalmist includes, not only the delights there experienced, but also all the blessings which God gives to those who devoutly worship him there - "from the forgiveness of sins to outward, temporal mercies" (Hengstenberg). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/65-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Blessed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;
