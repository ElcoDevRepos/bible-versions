The act of dividing garments was a common practice among Roman soldiers, who would claim the possessions of those they executed. This detail underscores the humiliation and degradation experienced by the crucified, as even their personal belongings were stripped away and distributed. The division of garments also symbolizes the fulfillment of prophecy, as this specific action was foretold in the Psalms, highlighting the divine orchestration of events surrounding the Messiah's suffering.<p><b>and cast lots for my clothing.</b><br>Casting lots was an ancient practice used to make decisions or determine fate, akin to drawing straws or rolling dice. In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, it emphasizes the randomness and indifference of the soldiers' actions, further illustrating the depth of Christ's suffering and abandonment. This act is directly referenced in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>, <a href="/mark/15-24.htm">Mark 15:24</a>, <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>), where the soldiers cast lots for Jesus' seamless tunic, a garment of significant value. The seamless nature of the tunic can be seen as a type of Christ's unity and perfection, which remains undivided even in the face of human cruelty. This fulfillment of prophecy serves as a testament to the accuracy and reliability of Scripture, reinforcing the belief in Jesus as the prophesied Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of anguish and abandonment, which prophetically points to the suffering of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The events described in <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a> are fulfilled in the crucifixion of Jesus, where Roman soldiers cast lots for His garments, as recorded in the Gospels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>These are the individuals who physically fulfilled the prophecy by dividing Jesus' garments and casting lots for His clothing during the crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was crucified, and where the events of <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a> were fulfilled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was crucified, fulfilling numerous Old Testament prophecies, including <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br><a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a> is a clear example of Old Testament prophecy fulfilled in the New Testament, demonstrating the divine inspiration and unity of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_suffering.htm">Christ's Suffering</a></b><br>Reflect on the depth of Christ's suffering and humiliation, as even His clothing was taken from Him, emphasizing His complete sacrifice for humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The fulfillment of prophecy in the smallest details, such as the casting of lots, underscores God's sovereign control over history and His plan of salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identification_with_suffering.htm">Identification with Suffering</a></b><br>Believers can find comfort in knowing that Jesus fully understands human suffering and loss, having experienced it Himself.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Even in moments of apparent chaos and injustice, like the crucifixion, God's purposes are being fulfilled.

David felt stripped of dignity by those who should have defended him. The Spirit carried this wording forward to the foot of Calvary. John records, &#8220;So they said to one another, &#8216;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it&#8217; &#8230; This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-24.htm">John 19:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene was not symbolic only; it literally unfolded beneath the cross, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s absolute reliability.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a> foretells the Messiah would be &#8220;numbered with the transgressors,&#8221; lining up with soldiers who treated His belongings as spoils.<p>&#8226; The division of garments also highlights how our sin strips righteousness from humanity, answered by Christ clothing believers with His own (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cast lots for my clothing</b><p>The second phrase narrows in on the single seamless tunic Christ wore (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23-24</a>).
