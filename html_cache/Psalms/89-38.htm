The psalmist is lamenting a perceived breach in this covenant, possibly during a time of national crisis or defeat. Historically, this could refer to events such as the Babylonian exile, where the Davidic line seemed to be in jeopardy. Theologically, it reflects the tension between God's promises and the reality of Israel's circumstances. The use of "spurned" and "rejected" suggests a deep sense of betrayal and abandonment, echoing the cries of other biblical figures who felt forsaken, such as Job or Jeremiah.<p><b>You are enraged by Your anointed one.</b><br>The "anointed one" refers to the king, specifically a descendant of David, as the term "anointed" (Hebrew: "mashiach") is often used for kings in the Old Testament. This phrase suggests that God's anger is directed towards the king, which could be due to the king's sin or failure to uphold the covenant. In a broader theological context, this can be seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate Anointed One, who also experienced rejection and bore the wrath of God on behalf of humanity. The psalmist's lament foreshadows the suffering of Jesus, who, despite being God's chosen, faced rejection and divine wrath on the cross. This connection underscores the mystery of God's plan, where apparent rejection leads to ultimate redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Ethan the Ezrahite)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is expressing lament over God's apparent rejection of the Davidic covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in the Psalm, whose actions of rejection and anger are being addressed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One (Davidic King)</a></b><br>Refers to the king from David's line, who is seen as God's chosen leader for Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that is experiencing turmoil and feels the impact of God's rejection of their king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise made by God to David, ensuring that his descendants would rule Israel forever.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_discipline.htm">Understanding God's Discipline</a></b><br>God's rejection and anger are not signs of His unfaithfulness but rather His discipline. <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> reminds us that the Lord disciplines those He loves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_lament.htm">The Reality of Lament</a></b><br>Lament is a valid expression of faith.

The psalmist feels that God has rejected the king and is furious with His own anointed, yet this lament sits inside a covenant framework that ultimately points to Christ. Seasons of divine discipline may look like abandonment, but they serve God&#8217;s larger, faithful plan&#8212;one that secures, not cancels, His everlasting covenant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/89.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">But thou.</span>--The poem takes a new departure here. God is reproached for violating the covenant, and the contrast between the actual condition of things in Israel at present, and the glorious destiny promised, is feelingly set forth.<p>The boldness of this expostulation has scandalised the Jewish expositors. But see exactly similar language, <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm" title="But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.">Psalm 44:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-22.htm" title="Yes, for your sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.">Psalm 44:22</a>. The point of the poem, indeed, is gone if we soften down these expressions. The stronger the conviction of the inviolability of God's promises, the more vehement becomes the sense of right to expostulate at their seeming violation, the delay of the fulfilment of the covenant. We may illustrate by the Latin poet's<p>"Hic pietatis honos, sic nos in sceptra reponis?"<p>VIRGIL: <span class= "ital">'n. </span>1:25.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-45.</span> - A sudden and complete change here sets in. Rejoicing is turned into mourning, eulogy into complaint. Notwithstanding all the promises of God, notwithstanding his inherent and essential "faithfulness," the Davidical king and his kingdom are at the last gasp. <span class="accented">Seemingly</span>, every promise made has been broken, every hope held out of good turned into an actuality of evil. God is wroth with his anointed, has made void the covenant with him, profaned his crown and cast it to the ground, turned the edge of his sword, and made him not to stand in the battle; he has laid his land open to the enemy, broken down its defenses, brought its strongholds to ruin, given it as a spoil to all who pass by; he has set up the right hand of Israel's adversaries, caused them to rejoice and triumph in Israel's disgrace and suffering; he has covered the king with shame, and cut short the days of his youth.
