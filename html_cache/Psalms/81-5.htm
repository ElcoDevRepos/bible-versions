Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, rose to prominence in Egypt, and his story is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness. The "testimony" likely refers to the statutes and laws given to Israel, which serve as a witness to God's covenant relationship with His people. This connects to <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, where Joseph's leadership in Egypt is a fulfillment of God's promises. The use of "Joseph" here can also symbolize the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often referred to as Ephraim, Joseph's son.<p><b>when he went out over the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, when God led the Israelites out of Egypt. It highlights God's deliverance and the establishment of Israel as a nation under His guidance. The Exodus is a central event in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation and God's power. It is a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus leads believers out of bondage to sin. The phrase also reflects the historical journey from slavery to freedom, emphasizing God's role in guiding and protecting His people.<p><b>where I heard an unfamiliar language</b><br>This likely refers to the Israelites' experience in Egypt, where they encountered a foreign culture and language. It underscores the alienation and oppression they faced as strangers in a foreign land. The "unfamiliar language" can symbolize the spiritual and cultural challenges Israel faced, contrasting with the language of God's covenant. This phrase may also allude to the confusion and disorientation of being in a place that does not align with God's promises, reminding believers of the importance of remaining faithful amidst worldly influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A key figure in the Old Testament, Joseph was one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

Hence, the LXX., in disregard of use, give "out of Egypt." But <span class= "ital">God </span>is doubtless the subject of the verb, and we may render, <span class= "ital">over the land of Egypt, </span>in allusion to <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>, or <span class= "ital">against the land of Egypt, </span>in reference to the Divine hostility to Pharaoh.<p><span class= "bld">Where I heard . . .</span>--The insertion of the relatival adverb, <span class= "ital">where, </span>makes this refer to the Egyptian tongue (comp. <a href="/psalms/114-1.htm" title="When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;">Psalm 114:1</a>), giving an equivalent for, "when I was in a foreign country." So apparently the LXX. and Vulg. But the expression, <span class= "ital">words unknown to me I heard, </span>when followed by an apparent quotation, most naturally introduces that quotation. The poet hears a message, which comes borne to him on the festival music, and this he goes on to deliver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/81.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony.</span> The special mention of "Joseph" here is strange. Professor Cheyne explains, "God appointed the Law to be valid in northern as well as southern Israel." Hengstenberg and Professor Alexander account for the expression by the pre-eminence of Joseph during the sojourn in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">When he went out through the land of Egypt</span>.
