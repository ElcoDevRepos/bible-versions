The psalmist acknowledges that every aspect of his life, including its duration and the events that unfold, is under God's authority. This echoes the biblical theme found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>, where there is a time for every purpose under heaven. The phrase also connects to the idea of God's providence, as seen in <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, where the days of a person's life are determined by God. The use of "hands" symbolizes power and care, suggesting that the psalmist feels secure in God's protective grasp.<p><b>deliver me from my enemies</b><br>The plea for deliverance from enemies is a common theme in the Psalms, reflecting the historical context of David's life, who faced numerous adversaries, including King Saul and foreign nations. This request for deliverance is not just a desire for physical safety but also a call for divine justice against those who oppose God's anointed. The concept of God as a deliverer is central to the Old Testament, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God delivers Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and spiritual enemies (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><b>and from those who pursue me.</b><br>The mention of pursuers indicates a sense of urgency and danger, as the psalmist is actively being chased by those who wish him harm. This reflects the historical reality of David's life, where he was often on the run from Saul and other adversaries. The cultural context of ancient Israel involved frequent conflicts and the need for refuge, which is why cities of refuge were established (<a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11-15</a>). Spiritually, this pursuit can be seen as a metaphor for the relentless nature of sin and temptation, from which believers seek God's protection. The imagery of pursuit also points to the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to flee from sin and pursue righteousness (<a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his psalms that express a wide range of human emotions and faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>In the context of this psalm, David refers to those who oppose him, possibly including King Saul, who pursued him, and other adversaries throughout his life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in whom David places his trust, acknowledging His sovereignty over time and circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all aspects of our lives, including the timing of events.
