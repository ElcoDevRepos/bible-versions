In the ancient Near East, kings often measured their strength by the size of their armies, believing that a large force could secure victory and protect their reign. However, biblical history repeatedly shows that true deliverance comes from God, not human resources. For example, in <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>, King Jehoshaphat faced a vast army but was delivered by God&#8217;s intervention rather than military strength. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the name of the Lord.<p><b>no warrior is delivered by his great strength.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the limitations of individual prowess and physical strength. In biblical times, warriors were esteemed for their combat skills and bravery, often seen as heroes capable of turning the tide of battle. Yet, the Bible consistently teaches that human strength is insufficient for true deliverance. The story of David and Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a> illustrates this point, where David, a young shepherd, defeats the giant Goliath not by physical might but by faith in God. This phrase also points to the broader biblical principle that God&#8217;s power is made perfect in weakness, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where Paul speaks of God&#8217;s grace being sufficient and His power being perfected in human weakness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents human authority and power, often seen as a figure of leadership and might.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/warrior.htm">Warrior</a></b><br>Symbolizes individual strength and skill, often associated with personal ability and courage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/army.htm">Army</a></b><br>A collective force, representing human efforts and resources in achieving security and victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god_over_human_strength.htm">Dependence on God Over Human Strength</a></b><br>Human strength and resources are insufficient for true deliverance.

From Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots drowning in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26-28</a>) to Sennacherib&#8217;s massive Assyrian forces halted by the angel of the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>), Scripture repeatedly shows God overruling impressive human resources.<p>&#8226; Trusting in armies rather than in the LORD is called out elsewhere: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). Likewise, Asa&#8217;s rebuke for leaning on Syria instead of God (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>) underscores the same lesson.<p>&#8226; God has never needed large numbers to achieve His purposes. In Gideon&#8217;s day He deliberately reduced Israel&#8217;s troops so the people would know, &#8220;The LORD saved us&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse applies personally as well. Promotion, savings accounts, or influence are not ultimate safeguards. Jesus&#8217; parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>) shows the futility of depending on earthly abundance apart from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no warrior is delivered by his great strength</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;No warrior is delivered by his great strength&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>b) speaks to the futility of individual prowess. Even the strongest champion cannot secure victory if the LORD withholds it. David testified to this when he told Goliath, &#8220;The battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s story illustrates both sides: empowered by God, his strength was unstoppable (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14-16</a>); separated from God, he became powerless (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Human ability is limited and fragile. &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>) pairs perfectly with this line, as does Paul&#8217;s acknowledgment, &#8220;When I am weak, then I am strong&#8221; because Christ&#8217;s power rests on him (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the takeaway is not passivity but humility. <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a> tells us to &#8220;be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power,&#8221; shifting confidence from ourselves to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> dismantles the illusion that deliverance comes from numbers or muscle.
