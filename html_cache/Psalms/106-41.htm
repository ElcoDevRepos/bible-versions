This is seen throughout the book of Judges and in the accounts of the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. The "nations" refer to the surrounding pagan peoples who often led Israel into sin. This act of delivering them into the hands of their enemies serves as both judgment and a call to repentance. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings follow obedience and curses follow disobedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>and those who hated them ruled over them</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the enmity between Israel and the surrounding nations. Historically, Israel faced oppression from various groups, including the Philistines, Moabites, and later, the Assyrians and Babylonians. The rule of those who "hated them" signifies a period of suffering and subjugation, often leading to a cry for deliverance. This situation is a direct result of Israel's failure to remain faithful to God. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who conquers sin and death, offering spiritual freedom to all who believe. The theme of enemies ruling over God's people is echoed in the New Testament, where spiritual forces are said to oppress humanity, but Christ's victory provides liberation (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who repeatedly turned away from Him, leading to their subjugation by foreign nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the foreign powers that God allowed to conquer and rule over Israel as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who, in His justice and mercy, allowed His people to be disciplined through foreign domination.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The nations and peoples who were hostile to Israel and took advantage of their weakened state to rule over them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced consequences for their repeated disobedience, we too must be aware that turning away from God can lead to spiritual and sometimes physical consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_discipline.htm">God's Sovereignty in Discipline</a></b><br>God&#8217;s allowance of foreign rule over Israel demonstrates His sovereignty and His use of discipline to bring His people back to Him.

When a nation sins, it is delivered over to its enemies, partly for punishment, partly to lead it to repentance. Israel was delivered into the hand, first, of Mesopotamia (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>), then of Moab (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), next of the Philistines (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), then of the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), later on of Midian (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>), still later of Ammon (<a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7-18</a>), and then of the Philistines once more (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>) - on each occasion because of some flagrant sins, and suffered chastisement until it repented. So we are told in Chronicles with respect to the invasions of Shishak (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-5</a>), of Pul (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25, 26</a>), of Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19, 20</a>), and of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-17</a>), that they were on account of the people's transgressions. God "slew" them that they might "seek him," and the ordinary result was, that they "turned themselves, and inquired after God." And they that hated them ruled over them.
