This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>. The act of opening a rock signifies God's power over nature and His ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations. The rock is often seen as a type of Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where Paul refers to Christ as the spiritual rock that accompanied the Israelites.<p><b>and water gushed out</b><br>The gushing water symbolizes God's abundant provision and His ability to meet the needs of His people. In a desert environment, water is a precious and scarce resource, making this miracle a profound demonstration of God's care and sustenance. This event prefigures the living water that Jesus offers in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, where He speaks to the Samaritan woman at the well, indicating the spiritual sustenance and eternal life He provides.<p><b>it flowed like a river in the desert</b><br>The imagery of a river in the desert highlights the miraculous nature of the event, as rivers are not naturally found in desert regions. This phrase emphasizes the transformation that God's intervention can bring, turning barrenness into abundance. It also connects to prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a>, where the desert is transformed into a fertile land, symbolizing the restoration and renewal that God promises. This transformation is also a metaphor for spiritual renewal and the life-giving presence of God among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and provision for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, he is the leader through whom God performed the miracle of bringing water from the rock.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's miraculous provision during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>The physical object that God used to provide water, symbolizing His ability to bring life and sustenance from unexpected sources.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_desert.htm">The Desert</a></b><br>Represents the challenging and barren environment where the Israelites found themselves, highlighting the miraculous nature of God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_desolation.htm">God's Provision in Desolation</a></b><br>God can provide for our needs even in the most barren and challenging circumstances.
