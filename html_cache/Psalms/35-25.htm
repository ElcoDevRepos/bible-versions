The expression "in their hearts" indicates a deep-seated desire for David's downfall, suggesting that the opposition is not merely external but rooted in internal malice. The exclamation "Aha" is a cry of triumph or satisfaction, often used in the Psalms to denote the scorn of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/70-3.htm">Psalm 70:3</a>). This reflects a cultural context where verbal expressions of victory were common in ancient Near Eastern conflicts. The phrase "just what we wanted" implies a premeditated plan against David, highlighting the depth of their animosity. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God thwarting the plans of the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>).<p><b>Let them not say, &#8220;We have swallowed him up!&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of being "swallowed up" suggests complete destruction or defeat, akin to being consumed by a predator. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe overwhelming calamity or judgment (<a href="/lamentations/2-16.htm">Lamentations 2:16</a>, <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>). Historically, this reflects the perilous nature of David's life, often pursued by enemies like Saul and later, his own son Absalom. The plea is for God to prevent his enemies from achieving total victory, which would be seen as a triumph over God's anointed king. This connects to the messianic theme, as David is a type of Christ, who also faced opposition and was thought to be defeated by His enemies, yet ultimately triumphed through the resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>). The phrase underscores the belief in divine justice and the ultimate vindication of the righteous.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often faced adversaries and sought God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries of David who sought his downfall and rejoiced at his misfortunes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and deliverer whom David calls upon for justice and protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David ruled, often facing external and internal threats.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a></b><br>The inner thoughts and intentions of David's enemies, which he asks God to thwart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_justice.htm">Trust in Divine Justice</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's justice rather than seeking personal revenge.

If gloating is stopped at the heart&#8211;level, it can never graduate to words or deeds.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1 and 10</a>:6 expose how the wicked speak first to themselves, convincing themselves God will not act. David counters that presumption by appealing directly to God&#8217;s justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Aha, just what we wanted!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The exclamation of triumph is the verbal spillover of the hidden contempt just addressed.

God&#8217;s people today likewise call out evil gloating so the Judge of all can silence it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them not say</b><p>&#8226; The repetition intensifies the plea&#8212;David wants every possible boast cut off. Compare <a href="/psalms/38-16.htm">Psalm 38:16</a>, where he again cries, &#8220;I said, &#8216;Let them not gloat over me.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; God often grants such requests: He &#8220;closes the mouths of lions&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>) and will one day &#8220;shut every mouth&#8221; before His throne (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking God to restrain enemy speech, David submits vengeance to the Lord (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) while still yearning for public vindication.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We have swallowed him up!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This is more than ridicule; it is a claim of total victory, the imagery of a predator finishing its prey (<a href="/psalms/124-2.htm">Psalm 124:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language in <a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a> shows violent men plotting, &#8220;Let us swallow them alive like Sheol.&#8221; David rejects their narrative and entrusts his survival to God, echoing how the sea monster could not &#8220;swallow up&#8221; Jonah permanently (<a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, God reverses such boasts: the earth, not the wicked, &#8220;swallowed&#8221; Pharaoh&#8217;s army (<a href="/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>) and will again swallow evil (<a href="/revelation/12-16.htm">Revelation 12:16</a>). David&#8217;s prayer anticipates that final overturning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a> captures a righteous appeal for God to stop the inward scheming, outward taunts, repeated boasts, and total-victory claims of the wicked. By naming each stage&#8212;heart-thought, mocking cry, persistent assertion, and final devouring threat&#8212;David entrusts every level of hostility to the Lord. The passage reassures believers that God sees hidden motives, silences arrogant words, and prevents enemies from &#8220;swallowing up&#8221; those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them not say in their hearts, Ah! so would we have it</span> (camp. ver. 21);
