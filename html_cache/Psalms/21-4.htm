In the historical context, David often faced threats to his life, whether from enemies or during battles. His plea for life reflects a dependence on God for protection and sustenance. Biblically, asking for life can also symbolize a deeper yearning for spiritual vitality and a relationship with God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, where life is associated with joy and eternal pleasures in God's presence.<p><b>and You granted it&#8212;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's faithfulness in responding to the prayers of His anointed. The granting of life signifies God's sovereignty and His ability to fulfill His promises. In the broader biblical narrative, God's granting of life can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eternal life offered through Jesus Christ, as referenced in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving eternal life to His followers.<p><b>length of days,</b><br>The phrase "length of days" is often used in the Old Testament to denote a long and prosperous life, a common blessing in ancient Israelite culture. It reflects the covenantal promises found in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>, where obedience to God's commandments is linked to prolonged life in the land. This concept is also echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>, which associates wisdom and understanding with long life and peace.<p><b>forever and ever.</b><br>This expression extends the promise of life beyond temporal existence, suggesting an eternal dimension. In the context of the Davidic covenant, it points to the everlasting kingdom promised to David's lineage, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the eternal King. The phrase "forever and ever" is a common biblical motif that underscores God's eternal nature and His unending reign, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a> and <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where God's kingdom is described as everlasting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, King David, is traditionally understood to be the speaker.
