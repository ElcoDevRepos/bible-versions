In biblical times, the "faithful of the land" referred to those who adhered to God's covenant and commandments. The psalmist, traditionally King David, expresses a desire to surround himself with those who are committed to righteousness. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/2-8.htm">Proverbs 2:8</a>, where God guards the paths of justice and preserves the way of His saints. The "eyes" symbolize God's watchful care and approval, suggesting divine favor and blessing upon those who remain steadfast in their faith.<p><b>that they may dwell with me</b><br>The concept of dwelling implies a close, personal relationship and fellowship. In ancient Israel, to dwell with someone was to share in their life and community. This phrase indicates the psalmist's intention to create a community or court of individuals who are devoted to God. It echoes the covenantal promise found in <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>, where God promises to set His dwelling among His people. This also foreshadows the New Testament idea of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>, where God dwells within His people.<p><b>he who walks in the way of integrity</b><br>Walking in integrity involves living a life that is consistent with God's laws and moral principles. In the Hebrew context, "walking" is often used metaphorically to describe one's conduct or way of life. Integrity is a key theme throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>, where Job is described as a man of integrity despite his trials. This phrase underscores the importance of moral uprightness and ethical behavior, which are essential qualities for those who serve in positions of leadership or influence.<p><b>shall minister to me</b><br>To minister means to serve or attend to someone, often in a religious or official capacity. In the context of a king like David, those who ministered to him would have been his advisors, officials, and servants who played crucial roles in the administration of his kingdom. This phrase highlights the expectation that those in service to the king must be individuals of integrity and faithfulness. It also points to the broader biblical theme of servant leadership, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve, as stated in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/101.htm">Psalm 101</a>, David is expressing his commitment to righteousness and integrity in his reign as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_of_the_land.htm">The Faithful of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to those who are loyal and devoted to God, living lives of integrity and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_way_of_integrity.htm">The Way of Integrity</a></b><br>Represents a lifestyle characterized by honesty, moral uprightness, and adherence to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_integrity.htm">The Importance of Integrity</a></b><br>Integrity is a key characteristic for those who wish to serve and dwell with God.

The gaze of the king&#8212;mirroring the Lord&#8217;s omniscient gaze (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>)&#8212;rests intentionally on those who prove loyal to God.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;faithful&#8221; points to men and women who keep covenant promises, much like Joshua and Caleb, whose steadfast hearts gained the Lord&#8217;s commendation (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s deliberate focus models leadership that prizes spiritual reliability above charisma, echoing <a href="/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>: &#8220;Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a trustworthy man?&#8221;<p>&#8226; By taking this stance, David upholds God&#8217;s standard that covenant faithfulness invites divine attention and blessing (<a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they may dwell with me</b><p>The purpose of David&#8217;s selective gaze is &#8220;&#8203;that they may dwell with me&#8203;&#8221; (v. 6b). Fellowship is reserved for the trustworthy.<p>&#8226; David echoes earlier psalms that ask who may live in God&#8217;s tent (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-2</a>; 24:3-4). The answer is consistent: only those who practice righteousness.<p>&#8226; In practical terms, righteous citizens enjoy proximity to the throne, influencing national policy, much as Joseph influenced Pharaoh because of proven integrity (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-40</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the verse anticipates Christ&#8217;s promise: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>).

David entrusts service only to proven servants of God.<p>&#8226; The pattern reflects God&#8217;s promise to raise &#8220;a faithful priest&#8221; who &#8220;will walk before My anointed forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Ministry, whether in royal courts or modern churches, is reserved for &#8220;vessels for honorable use&#8230; prepared for every good work&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the verse prefigures believers&#8217; royal-priestly calling: &#8220;To Him who has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Integrity is the credential God honors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a> reveals a divine pattern mirrored by David: God focuses on the faithful, grants them intimate fellowship, tests their daily walk for integrity, and then entrusts them with service.
