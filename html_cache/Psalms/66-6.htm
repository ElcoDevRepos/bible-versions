This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and power. The transformation of the sea into dry land demonstrates God's control over nature, affirming His sovereignty. Geographically, the Red Sea is a significant body of water, and its parting would have been an awe-inspiring sight. This miracle is a type of Christ's power over creation, as seen in the New Testament when Jesus calms the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>. Theologically, this act prefigures the believer's passage from death to life, from bondage to freedom, through the waters of baptism.<p><b>they passed through the waters on foot;</b><br>The Israelites' passage through the Red Sea on foot signifies their transition from slavery in Egypt to freedom. This act of walking on dry ground amidst parted waters is a testament to their faith and God's faithfulness. Historically, this event marks the beginning of the Exodus journey, a foundational narrative for the Jewish people. Culturally, it underscores the theme of pilgrimage and journey, which is prevalent throughout Scripture. This passage is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, where Paul draws a parallel between the Israelites' experience and Christian baptism, emphasizing the continuity of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>there we rejoiced in Him.</b><br>The rejoicing mentioned here reflects the Israelites' response to God's deliverance. After crossing the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites sang a song of praise, recorded in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, celebrating God's triumph over their enemies. This joy is not merely emotional but is rooted in the recognition of God's salvation and provision. In a broader biblical context, rejoicing in God is a recurring theme, seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are encouraged to rejoice in the Lord always. This joy is prophetic of the ultimate rejoicing in Christ's victory over sin and death, as believers anticipate the eternal joy of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and faithfulness by performing miracles for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Refers to the Red Sea, which God miraculously parted for the Israelites during the Exodus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dry_land.htm">Dry Land</a></b><br>The path God created through the sea, symbolizing His provision and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people who experienced this miraculous deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus_event.htm">Exodus Event</a></b><br>The historical event where God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, a foundational account of faith and trust in God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God has absolute control over the natural world, as demonstrated by His ability to part the sea.

The same power later halted the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-17</a>), proving that He is consistent and faithful.<p>- For believers today, this event anchors our confidence that the Lord can still make a way where none exists&#8212;whether in national crises or personal trials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They passed through the waters on foot</b><p>- Crossing &#8220;on foot&#8221; stresses that the seabed was not merely exposed but firm and walkable, fulfilling the promise of safe passage (<a href="/hebrews/11-29.htm">Hebrews 11:29</a>).<p>- The people&#8217;s obedience&#8212;stepping between towering walls of water&#8212;illustrates faith in action (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>).<p>- The same principle applies now: salvation in Christ involves trusting His provision and moving forward, even when circumstances appear impossible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There we rejoiced in Him</b><p>- Once safely across, the nation erupted in worship: &#8220;Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-2</a>).
