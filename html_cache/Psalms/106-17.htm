In the biblical context, this is a divine act of judgment. The event is recorded in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, where God intervenes directly to punish rebellion against Moses and Aaron. The opening of the earth symbolizes God's power over creation and His ability to execute judgment. This act serves as a warning against disobedience and rebellion against God's appointed leaders.<p><b>and swallowed Dathan;</b><br>Dathan was one of the leaders of the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, alongside Korah and Abiram. The swallowing by the earth signifies a complete and irreversible judgment. In the cultural context of the Israelites, being swallowed by the earth would be seen as a direct act of divine retribution, emphasizing the seriousness of their sin. This event underscores the importance of respecting God's chosen leaders and the consequences of challenging divine authority.<p><b>it covered the assembly of Abiram.</b><br>Abiram, like Dathan, was part of the rebellious group. The "assembly" refers to those who joined in the insurrection. The covering of the assembly by the earth indicates total destruction and serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of collective rebellion. This event is a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate separation of the righteous from the wicked. It also highlights the theme of God's justice and the importance of communal responsibility in following God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan.htm">Dathan</a></b><br>A Reubenite who, along with Abiram and Korah, led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron as recorded in <a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>.
