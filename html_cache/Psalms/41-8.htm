In biblical times, disease was sometimes seen as a consequence of sin or divine judgment. The imagery of something being "poured into" implies an external force or judgment, aligning with the belief that God allows or sends trials for purification or punishment. This can be connected to Job's suffering, where his friends wrongly assume his afflictions are due to sin. Theologically, it reflects the human condition of suffering and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>he will never get up from where he lies!</b><br>This part of the verse conveys a sense of hopelessness and finality, suggesting that the afflicted person is beyond recovery. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, lying down often symbolized death or severe incapacitation. This phrase can be seen as a reflection of the despair felt by those who are suffering, yet it also foreshadows the resurrection hope found in Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus often healed those who were thought to be beyond help, symbolizing His power over sin and death. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was thought to be defeated in death but rose again, defying the expectation of never rising.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, David is expressing his lament and trust in God amidst betrayal and illness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The psalm speaks of those who wish harm upon David, possibly referring to personal adversaries or even close friends who have turned against him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/illness.htm">Illness</a></b><br>The "vile disease" mentioned symbolizes both physical ailment and the spiritual or emotional affliction caused by betrayal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate healer and protector, whom David trusts to deliver him from his afflictions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/betrayal.htm">Betrayal</a></b><br>An underlying theme in the psalm, reflecting the pain of being betrayed by those close to him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_amidst_suffering.htm">Trust in God Amidst Suffering</a></b><br>Even when afflicted by illness or betrayal, believers are encouraged to place their trust in God, who is sovereign over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_betrayal.htm">The Reality of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal is a painful reality that even the most faithful can experience.

The expression may mean, as in LXX. and Vulg., "a lawless speech," so the Chaldee, "a perverse word." Syriac, "a word of iniquity," or "a physical evil," as in Authorised Version, or "a moral evil." The verse is difficult, not only from this ambiguity, but also from that of the verb, which, according to the derivation we take, may mean "cleave" or "pour forth." Modern scholars prefer the latter, understanding the image as taken from the process of casting metal. <span class= "ital">An incurable wound is poured out </span>(<span class= "ital">welded</span>)<span class= "ital"> upon him. </span>(Comp.
