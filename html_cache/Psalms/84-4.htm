In the context of ancient Israel, "Your house" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship where God's presence was believed to dwell. The Temple was a symbol of God's covenant with Israel and a place where sacrifices and offerings were made. The idea of dwelling in God's house suggests a continuous, intimate relationship with Him, akin to the Levites and priests who served in the Temple. This blessing is not just about physical proximity but spiritual closeness, reflecting a life dedicated to worship and service. The concept of dwelling with God is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), indicating that God's presence now resides within His people.<p><b>They are ever praising You.</b><br>This phrase highlights the perpetual nature of worship for those who are in God's presence. The act of praising God is not limited to specific times or places but is a continual expression of gratitude and reverence. In the historical context, the Levites were appointed to offer praise and music in the Temple day and night (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>). This constant praise reflects a life centered around God, where every action and thought is an act of worship. Theologically, it points to the eternal worship that will take place in the new heaven and new earth, as described in <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>, where all creation will join in unending praise to God. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the joy and fulfillment found in worship, as it aligns the worshiper with God's will and purpose.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical marker, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or a musical interlude. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but it serves to emphasize the preceding statement, inviting the reader or listener to meditate on the truth just expressed. In this context, "Selah" encourages contemplation of the blessedness and joy of dwelling in God's presence and the continuous praise that results from such a relationship. It invites believers to pause and consider the depth of their own relationship with God and the nature of their worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_korah.htm">Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a>, the Sons of Korah were a group of Levitical singers in the temple.

Here the word isn&#8217;t wishful; it&#8217;s an assurance. The psalmist isn&#8217;t saying, &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll be happy,&#8221; but &#8220;they already are.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This blessing flows from proximity to God, not from possessions or circumstances (<a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It&#8217;s the same settled joy David anticipated: &#8220;Surely goodness and mercy will follow me &#8230; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Under the New Covenant, Jesus echoes this happiness by promising a home prepared for us in the Father&#8217;s house (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who dwell in Your house</b><p>To &#8220;dwell&#8221; speaks of ongoing residence&#8212;living, not merely visiting.
