The Psalms were used in ancient Israelite worship and continue to be central in Jewish and Christian liturgies. The term "Psalm" comes from the Greek "psalmos," meaning a song sung to the accompaniment of a harp or lyre, reflecting the musical nature of these compositions.<p><b>Sing to the LORD a new song,</b><br>The call to sing a "new song" suggests a fresh expression of praise and worship, often in response to a new act of divine deliverance or revelation. This phrase is used in several other Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3, 96</a>:1) and in Revelation (5:9, 14:3), indicating a theme of renewal and the ongoing work of God. The "new song" signifies a response to God's continuous and dynamic interaction with His people, inviting them to recognize and celebrate His ongoing acts of salvation.<p><b>for He has done wonders;</b><br>The "wonders" refer to God's miraculous deeds and mighty acts throughout history, such as the creation, the Exodus, and other instances of divine intervention. These acts demonstrate God's power and faithfulness to His covenant people. The term "wonders" is often associated with the miraculous events that reveal God's sovereignty and serve as a testament to His glory and might (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>).<p><b>His right hand and holy arm</b><br>The "right hand" and "holy arm" are symbolic of God's power and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was often associated with strength and skill. The "holy arm" emphasizes God's purity and righteousness in executing His will. These terms are anthropomorphic, attributing human characteristics to God to convey His active involvement in the world. They are also seen in <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, where God's arm is bared in the sight of all nations, signifying His readiness to act on behalf of His people.<p><b>have gained Him the victory.</b><br>The victory mentioned here is a testament to God's triumph over His enemies and the deliverance of His people. This victory is not just military but also spiritual, reflecting God's ultimate authority over all creation. The concept of divine victory is prevalent throughout the Bible, culminating in the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). This phrase reassures believers of God's sovereign control and His ability to bring about His purposes despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.
