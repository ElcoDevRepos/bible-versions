This phrase suggests a practice of meditation and remembrance, common in Hebrew poetry, where recalling past experiences serves as a source of comfort and strength. The act of pouring out one's soul is akin to a heartfelt prayer or lament, a practice seen throughout the Psalms, where the psalmist often turns to God in times of distress (e.g., <a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p><b>how I walked with the multitude:</b><br>This recalls communal worship, a central aspect of Israelite religious life. The psalmist remembers participating in large gatherings, possibly during one of the three major pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Pentecost, or Tabernacles, when Israelites traveled to Jerusalem. Walking with the multitude emphasizes unity and shared faith, reflecting the collective identity of the people of God.<p><b>leading the festive procession to the house of God:</b><br>The "house of God" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the focal point of Jewish worship and sacrifice. Leading a procession suggests a role of leadership or prominence, possibly as a Levite or a leader of worship. Festive processions were marked by joy and celebration, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>, where David leads the ark to Jerusalem with music and dancing.<p><b>with shouts of joy and praise:</b><br>This phrase captures the exuberant worship style of ancient Israel, characterized by vocal expressions of joy and gratitude. Shouts of joy and praise were integral to worship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100:1-2</a>, which calls for joyful noise unto the Lord.

In the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me.">Psalm 142:3</a>). But the Authorised Version is better, "when I think of it, my heart must overflow." The expression, "I pour out my soul upon me," may, however, mean, "I weep floods of tears over myself," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "over my lot."<p><span class= "bld">For I had gone with the multitude.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg., as well as the strangeness of the words rendered "multitude" and "went with them," indicate a corruption of the text. Fortunately the general sense and reference of the verse are independent of the doubtful expressions. The poet indulges in a grateful recollection of some great festival, probably the Feast of Tabernacles.

Dancing appears to have been a recognised part of the ceremonial. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I remember these things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">these things I remember</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> things remembered being those touched on in the rest of the verse - his former free access to the house of God, and habit of frequenting it, especially on festival occasions, when the multitude "kept holy day."
