In the context of <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing gratitude for God's deliverance from his enemies, particularly Saul. The concept of righteousness here is not about sinless perfection but about a sincere heart and faithfulness to God's covenant. In the Old Testament, righteousness often involves adherence to the Law and maintaining a right relationship with God. This idea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, which states that the wicked earn deceptive wages, but those who sow righteousness reap a sure reward. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate righteous one, and through whom believers are rewarded with eternal life.<p><b>He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.</b><br>The "cleanness of my hands" symbolizes innocence and purity in actions. In ancient Israel, clean hands were a metaphor for moral integrity and ethical behavior. This imagery is also found in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, where those with clean hands and a pure heart are described as worthy to ascend the hill of the LORD. The historical context of David's life, particularly his refusal to harm Saul despite being pursued, exemplifies this cleanness. David's actions were in line with God's commands, demonstrating his loyalty and trust in God's justice. This phrase also points forward to Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life and whose hands were truly clean, fulfilling the law perfectly and offering redemption to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing gratitude and praise to God for deliverance from his enemies, including King Saul.

This is not bragging; it is a faith&#8211;filled recognition that God keeps His word to bless obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>).<p>- &#8220;Righteousness&#8221; here speaks of a life aligned with God&#8217;s revealed standards. David had refused to take Saul&#8217;s life when he had the chance (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>). He sought to rule Israel with justice instead of self-promotion. In <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a> he prayed, &#8220;Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness,&#8221; using the same vocabulary.<p>- Scripture consistently affirms that God sees and rewards faithful living: &#8220;The righteous will live by his faith&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>), and &#8220;There is reserved for me the crown of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>). These passages show that reward is God&#8217;s gracious response to a heart that trusts and obeys Him.<p>- Important balance: the Bible also teaches that our righteousness is ultimately a gift from God (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>). Even so, God invites us to walk in that righteousness and promises tangible blessing when we do (<a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands</b><p>- &#8220;Clean hands&#8221; is vivid imagery for moral innocence. <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> asks, &#8220;Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD?
