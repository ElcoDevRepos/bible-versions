In the biblical context, enemies often sought to undermine the reputation and authority of God's anointed. This is reminiscent of the experiences of King David, who faced slander from figures like Saul and Absalom. The act of speaking against someone was a common tactic in ancient Near Eastern cultures to discredit and demoralize. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who faced false accusations and slander from religious leaders and others during His earthly ministry (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>).<p><b>and those who lie in wait for my life conspire</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the active plotting and scheming of the psalmist's enemies. The imagery of lying in wait suggests a premeditated and malicious intent, akin to a predator stalking its prey. Historically, this reflects the political intrigue and betrayal that were common in the courts of ancient Israel and surrounding nations. The phrase "lie in wait" is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the actions of those who seek to harm the innocent (<a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>). This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the conspiracy against Jesus, who was betrayed by Judas and plotted against by the Sanhedrin (<a href="/mark/14.htm">Mark 14:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>These are individuals or groups who oppose the psalmist, seeking to harm or undermine him.
