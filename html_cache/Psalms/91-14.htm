In the Hebrew context, love is not merely an emotion but involves loyalty and commitment. This reflects the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength is commanded. The love here is covenantal, suggesting a deep, abiding connection that mirrors the love God has for His people.<p><b>I will deliver him</b><br>Deliverance in the biblical sense often refers to salvation or rescue from danger. This promise of deliverance can be seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Exodus narrative where God delivers Israel from Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides salvation from sin and death. The deliverance promised here is both physical and spiritual, indicating God's comprehensive protection.<p><b>because he knows My name</b><br>Knowing God's name implies an intimate understanding of His character and attributes. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence of a person. God's name, revealed as Yahweh, signifies His eternal presence and faithfulness. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>, where God reveals His name to Moses. It suggests trust and reliance on God's nature and promises.<p><b>I will protect him</b><br>Protection here is a divine assurance of safety and security. This promise is consistent with God's role as a refuge and fortress, as seen in the earlier verses of <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>. The protection is not just from physical harm but also from spiritual threats. This echoes the New Testament assurance in passages like <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, where Jesus speaks of His followers being secure in His hand. The protection is comprehensive, covering all aspects of life for those who trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Moses or David, the psalmist is the one who conveys God's promises of protection and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising deliverance and protection to those who love and know Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believer.htm">The Believer</a></b><br>The individual who loves God and knows His name, receiving the promises of deliverance and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_love_for_god.htm">The Power of Love for God</a></b><br>Loving God is not just an emotional response but a commitment that brings divine promises.

"By a sudden and effective transition," as Professor Cheyne remarks, "Jehovah becomes the speaker" of the concluding strophe.
