In the cultural context of ancient Israel, disease, particularly skin diseases, were often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or punishment, leading to social ostracism. <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13-14</a> outlines the laws regarding leprosy and other skin conditions, emphasizing the need for separation from the community. This separation was not only physical but also social and emotional, as those afflicted were often viewed with fear and suspicion. The psalmist's lament echoes Job's experience, where his friends and family distanced themselves due to his suffering (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-19</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the suffering of Jesus Christ, who was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), highlighting the theme of the righteous sufferer.<p><b>and my kinsmen stand at a distance</b><br>The mention of "kinsmen" underscores the depth of the psalmist's isolation, as family ties were of utmost importance in ancient Near Eastern societies. Family members were expected to provide support and care, yet here they are depicted as standing aloof. This could be due to fear of ritual impurity or social stigma associated with the psalmist's condition. The distance of kinsmen can also be seen in the broader biblical narrative, where familial betrayal and abandonment are recurring themes, such as Joseph's brothers selling him into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-12.htm">Genesis 37:12-28</a>) or David's own family dynamics (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>). This phrase further connects to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of division within families due to allegiance to Him (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>), and His own experience of being forsaken by His disciples (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, this psalm is a penitential psalm where David expresses his deep distress and sense of isolation due to his sin and its consequences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends_and_companions.htm">Friends and Companions</a></b><br>These are the people who were once close to David but now avoid him due to his afflictions, highlighting the theme of abandonment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>Those who live near David, representing the broader community that distances itself from him in his time of need.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wounds.htm">Wounds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the consequences of sin and the physical and emotional pain that David is experiencing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isolation.htm">Isolation</a></b><br>The event of being left alone in suffering, which is a central theme of this verse, reflecting the broader human experience of feeling abandoned in times of trouble.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_isolation_in_suffering.htm">The Reality of Isolation in Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering can lead to feelings of isolation, even from those closest to us.

Now, even companionship disappears. Similar scenes surface in <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a> and <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>, where faithful servants of God watch relationships evaporate in the heat of suffering. We also see this pattern fulfilled in Christ, whose closest followers &#8220;all left Him and fled&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>). The verse therefore paints a literal picture of social abandonment that believers may experience when trials expose the shallow roots of some friendships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shun my disease</b><p>The Berean Standard Bible renders it, &#8220;avoid me because of my wounds.&#8221; Ancient Israel knew the isolation attached to visible affliction (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45&#8211;46</a>). Whether David&#8217;s condition was physical or the outward toll of sin&#8217;s consequences (vv. 4&#8211;5), people recoiled. Wounds&#8212;literal or moral&#8212;often repel rather than attract help. Job&#8217;s sores drew the same response (<a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), and even lepers in Jesus&#8217; day &#8220;stood at a distance&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>). The line reminds us that sin and suffering can create a chasm only God&#8217;s grace closes (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my kinsmen</b><p>The circle tightens further: blood relatives. Family desertion deepens the sting. David had tasted it before when his brothers doubted him (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>) and later when Absalom&#8217;s rebellion split the royal household (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13&#8211;14</a>). Scripture notes that &#8220;even my own brothers believe not&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>) concerning Jesus, underscoring how familial ties can fray under spiritual strain. <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a> captures the same grief: &#8220;I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother&#8217;s sons.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stand at a distance</b><p>Distance here is both physical and emotional. Instead of pressing in to help, loved ones retreat, leaving the sufferer exposed. <a href="/luke/23-49.htm">Luke 23:49</a> records that many who knew Jesus &#8220;stood at a distance&#8221; during His crucifixion. Paul later wrote, &#8220;At my first defense no one stood with me&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>). Yet God never remains aloof; He &#8220;is near to the brokenhearted&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>). The abandonment David felt becomes a backdrop highlighting the steadfast presence of the Lord who &#8220;will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a> presents a stark, literal snapshot of abandonment: friends, loved ones, and family step back when David&#8217;s wounds become too unsightly. The verse teaches that suffering often reveals the frailty of human support, but it simultaneously drives the faithful to the One who never withdraws. Believers who encounter similar isolation can rest assured that the Lord, who stood with David and later experienced ultimate abandonment at Calvary, remains closer than any friend or kin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Sore </span>is rather <span class= "ital">stroke, </span>as in margin, or <span class= "ital">plague. </span>His friends, looking on him as "one smitten of God," and thinking "he must be wicked to deserve such pain," abandon him as too vile for their society.<p><span class= "bld">Kinsmen.</span>--Render rather, as in margin, <span class= "ital">neighbours, </span>or <span class= "ital">near ones.</span><p>Those who should have been near me stand aloof.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore</span>; or, <span class="accented">from my stroke</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/39-10.htm">Psalm 39:10</a>, where the same word is used). The psalmist feels himself to be "stricken, smitten of God" (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>). He looks for comfort and sympathy to his friends, but they, with a selfishness that is only too common, hold aloof, draw away item him, and desert him (comp. <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And my kinsmen stand afar off</span>;
