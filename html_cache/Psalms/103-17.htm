The concept of "everlasting" is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's unchanging and infinite nature (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). It contrasts the temporal nature of human life with the eternal nature of God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, where the Word of God stands forever. This eternal perspective is foundational to understanding God's covenantal faithfulness throughout biblical history.<p><b>the loving devotion of the LORD</b><br>"Loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses steadfast love, mercy, and covenantal loyalty. This term is central to God's relationship with Israel, as seen in His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and His promises to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). It reflects God's commitment to His people despite their unfaithfulness, as illustrated in the prophetic writings, such as Hosea, where God's love persists despite Israel's infidelity.<p><b>extends to those who fear Him</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a foundational concept in wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where it is described as the beginning of knowledge. This fear is not terror but a reverent awe and respect for God's holiness and authority. It denotes a relationship of obedience and trust, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Job (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>). This reverence is a prerequisite for experiencing God's loving devotion.<p><b>and His righteousness to their children&#8217;s children&#8212;</b><br>This phrase underscores the generational impact of God's righteousness, which is His moral perfection and justice. The promise of God's righteousness extending to descendants is reminiscent of the blessings promised to Abraham's offspring (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). It highlights the biblical principle of generational blessings and responsibilities, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. This continuity reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant and His desire for His people to walk in His ways across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, known for His steadfast love and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_him.htm">Those who fear Him</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who have a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His authority and majesty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children's_children.htm">Children&#8217;s children</a></b><br>The descendants of those who fear the LORD, indicating the generational impact of God's promises and blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_nature_of_god's_love.htm">Eternal Nature of God's Love</a></b><br>God's loving devotion is not limited by time; it spans from everlasting to everlasting, offering believers a foundation of security and hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord_as_a_key_to_blessing.htm">Fear of the LORD as a Key to Blessing</a></b><br>Reverence and awe for God are crucial for experiencing His loving devotion and righteousness, impacting not only individuals but also their descendants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_impact_of_faithfulness.htm">Generational Impact of Faithfulness</a></b><br>The faithfulness of one generation can lead to blessings for future generations, encouraging believers to live in a way that honors God and benefits their descendants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_as_a_legacy.htm">God's Righteousness as a Legacy</a></b><br>The righteousness of God is a gift that can be passed down, encouraging believers to cultivate a life of integrity and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in the enduring promises of God, knowing that His love and righteousness are unwavering and extend beyond their lifetime.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_103_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 103:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_103_17_God_s_eternal_love.htm">How does Psalm 103:17 emphasize God's eternal love for those who fear Him?
