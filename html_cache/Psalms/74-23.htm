In the historical context, adversaries often refer to nations or groups that were hostile to Israel, such as the Babylonians or Assyrians. Theologically, adversaries can also represent spiritual forces opposed to God's purposes. This plea echoes other biblical cries for divine intervention, such as in <a href="/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83:1-2</a>, where the psalmist asks God not to remain silent in the face of enemy threats. The call for God not to disregard suggests a deep trust in His ability to act and a belief in His justice.<p><b>the uproar of Your enemies</b><br>The term "uproar" conveys a sense of chaos and tumult, often associated with war or rebellion. Historically, Israel faced numerous enemies who sought to destroy or subjugate them, and this uproar could symbolize both physical and spiritual battles. In a broader biblical context, enemies of God are those who oppose His will and kingdom, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare against rulers and authorities. The uproar can also be seen as a type of the opposition Jesus faced from religious leaders and others who rejected His message.<p><b>that ascends continually</b><br>The phrase "ascends continually" suggests that the opposition is relentless and ongoing. This persistence can be seen in the historical context of Israel's repeated conflicts with surrounding nations. It also reflects the ongoing spiritual battle that believers face, as described in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where the devil is likened to a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. The continual nature of the adversaries' uproar emphasizes the need for constant vigilance and reliance on God. In a prophetic sense, it points to the ultimate victory of God over all His enemies, as foretold in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ triumphs over the forces of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/74.htm">Psalm 74</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
