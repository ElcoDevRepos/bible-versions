Endor is a location in the territory of Manasseh, near the Jezreel Valley. It is famously known as the place where King Saul consulted a medium before his final battle against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>). The mention of Endor in <a href="/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a> likely alludes to the defeat of the Midianites and their allies, as recounted in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-7</a>, where God delivered Israel from oppression through leaders like Deborah and Gideon. The reference serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and judgment against those who opposed His people.<p><b>and became like dung on the ground</b><br>This vivid imagery emphasizes the totality of the enemies' defeat and their subsequent disgrace. In ancient Near Eastern culture, being compared to dung signifies utter humiliation and worthlessness. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the fate of those who oppose God (<a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>). The imagery underscores the theme of divine justice, where those who rise against God's chosen people are ultimately brought low. It also serves as a prophetic warning to future adversaries of Israel, highlighting the futility of opposing God's sovereign plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>A location in ancient Israel, known for its association with the defeat of the Canaanite kings.

The fields around Endor still bore silent witness to God&#8217;s intervention.<p>&#8226; The location also highlights how God can turn an enemy&#8217;s greatest strength into a liability; iron chariots became useless in the mud (<a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And became like dung on the ground</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures complete humiliation: the defeated armies were left unburied, their bodies decaying &#8220;like dung&#8221; that fertilizes the soil (cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; For the original singers, this vivid image reinforced two truths:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s judgment is thorough; no one who opposes Him escapes.<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s people can trust Him to vindicate His name in ways that leave no doubt about His supremacy (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking such stark language, the psalmist teaches that the Lord&#8217;s deliverance is not partial or cosmetic. When He rises to defend His covenant people, He leaves tangible evidence that He alone is God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a> recalls the utter defeat of Sisera and Jabin at Endor to bolster faith for a new deliverance.
