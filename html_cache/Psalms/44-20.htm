In the ancient Near Eastern context, names held significant power and meaning. Forgetting God's name implies a breach of the covenant, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, where forgetting God leads to following other gods. The Israelites were repeatedly warned against this in the Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The name of God, often represented as Yahweh, was central to Israel's identity and worship, distinguishing them from surrounding nations.<p><b>or spread out our hands to a foreign god</b><br>Spreading out hands is a gesture of prayer or worship, indicating devotion and supplication. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, this act directed towards a foreign god would signify idolatry, a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The Israelites were surrounded by nations with polytheistic practices, such as the Canaanites, who worshipped deities like Baal and Asherah. This phrase underscores the temptation and danger of syncretism, which the prophets frequently condemned (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>). The act of turning to foreign gods is seen as spiritual adultery, a betrayal of the exclusive relationship between God and His people. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of fidelity to Christ, who fulfills the role of the one true mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who played a significant role in temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom this Psalm is addressed, representing the collective experience of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>Refers to the idols and deities worshiped by surrounding nations, which Israel was repeatedly warned against following.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_god.htm">The Name of God</a></b><br>Represents the character and authority of Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for Israel, where the name of God was honored and sacrifices were made.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>The importance of remaining faithful to God and not turning to idols, whether physical or metaphorical.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry can take many forms today, such as materialism, power, or self-worship.

If Israel had either forgotten the true God (see above, ver. 17) or fallen away to the worship of false or strange gods - then her ill success against her foreign enemies would have been fully accounted for, since it would only have been in accordance with the threatenings of the Law (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-23</a>); but as she had done neither of these things, her defeats and depressed condition seemed to the psalmist wholly unaccountable.
