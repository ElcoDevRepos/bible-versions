The dove is often a symbol of peace and purity in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a> when the dove returns to Noah with an olive leaf, signaling the end of the flood. The psalmist's desire for wings like a dove suggests a longing for divine intervention and deliverance from distress. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, birds were often seen as messengers or symbols of freedom, and the dove specifically represents innocence and the Spirit of God, as seen in the New Testament during Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>).<p><b>I would fly away and find rest.</b><br>The desire to "fly away and find rest" indicates a wish to escape the current afflictions and find solace. This reflects the human condition of seeking refuge from life's burdens, a theme prevalent throughout the Psalms. The concept of rest is significant in biblical theology, often associated with God's presence and peace, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>, which speaks of a Sabbath rest for the people of God. Historically, the psalmist, traditionally believed to be David, faced numerous adversities, including betrayal and conflict, which would naturally lead to a desire for rest and safety. This longing for rest can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers ultimate rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), providing a prophetic glimpse into the peace found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing a deep desire to escape his troubles and find peace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dove.htm">Dove</a></b><br>A symbol of peace and innocence, the dove represents the longing for escape and tranquility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of David's life often revolves around Jerusalem, where he faced many of his trials.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The psalm reflects David's struggles with betrayal and opposition, possibly during Absalom's rebellion or another period of personal conflict.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Implied as a place of refuge and solitude, contrasting with the turmoil David faces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/longing_for_escape.htm">Longing for Escape</a></b><br>It's natural to desire escape from life's pressures, but we must seek God's presence as our ultimate refuge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_dove.htm">Symbolism of the Dove</a></b><br>The dove represents peace and the Holy Spirit.

He is not theorizing about trouble; he is speaking from the thick of it (<a href="/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture faithfully records his actual words, reminding us that God invites honest speech (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes earlier moments when David verbalized his distress: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I will watch my ways&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>) and &#8220;I said, &#8216;My foot is slipping&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/94-18.htm">Psalm 94:18</a>).<p>These examples show that talk directed toward God is an act of faith, not unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oh, that I had wings</b><p>A cry of yearning, not fantasy.<p>&#8226; David is convinced God could grant such wings; he isn&#8217;t merely day-dreaming (<a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a> reminds believers that the Lord renews strength so they &#8220;will soar on wings like eagles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a> pictures God Himself carrying Israel &#8220;on eagles&#8217; wings,&#8221; proving that escape and protection are realities God can supply.<p>&#8226; Longing for supernatural aid is therefore grounded in divine precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a dove!</b><p>The dove conveys safety and innocence.<p>&#8226; When Noah&#8217;s dove found land, it signaled deliverance (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8&#8211;12</a>); David seeks the same assurance.<p>&#8226; Jesus later urged His followers to be &#8220;harmless as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), linking the bird with peaceful refuge.<p>&#8226; The Spirit descended &#8220;like a dove&#8221; on Christ (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>), affirming that God&#8217;s presence provides the calm David desires.<p>&#8226; Choosing a dove, not an eagle, highlights a wish for quiet shelter rather than aggressive escape.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I would fly away</b><p>The verb shows decisive action.<p>&#8226; David pictures immediate removal from betrayal and violence (<a href="/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays flight to God-appointed hideaways: Elijah fled to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3&#8211;4</a>); believers are urged, &#8220;Flee from idolatry&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> counters fearful flight, yet here David is not running from God&#8217;s will but longing for God&#8217;s haven.<p>&#8226; His confidence is that when God opens a path, departure will be swift and sure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And find rest</b><p>The goal is not distance but peace.<p>&#8226; &#8220;My soul finds rest in God alone&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1</a>); David&#8217;s ultimate refuge is relational, not geographical.<p>&#8226; Jesus promises, &#8220;You will find rest for your souls&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28&#8211;29</a>), fulfilling the psalmist&#8217;s hope.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9&#8211;11</a> points to a Sabbath-rest that remains for God&#8217;s people, urging diligence to enter it.<p>&#8226; Thus, wings, flight, and distance all converge on the deeper gift&#8212;God-given rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6</a> captures David&#8217;s heartfelt desire to escape treachery and settle into God&#8217;s protective peace. He honestly voices his need (&#8220;I said&#8221;), longs for divine enablement (&#8220;Oh, that I had wings&#8221;), chooses the emblem of gentle safety (&#8220;like a dove&#8221;), pictures decisive deliverance (&#8220;I would fly away&#8221;), and fixes on the ultimate blessing (&#8220;and find rest&#8221;). The verse invites every believer to bring real fears to the Lord, trust His power to rescue, and anticipate the true rest He faithfully supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/55.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Oh that I had.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">who will give me?</span>--The bird that was in the psalmist's thought was doubtless the Rock Pigeon (<span class= "ital">Columba livia</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which selects for its nesting the lofty cliffs and deep ravines far from the neighbourhood of man.

Great composers have set to it some of their most exquisite music. The desire is one which finds an echo in almost every human breast, and the expression of it here has all the beauty of the best Eastern poetry. Jeremiah's words are far tamer, "Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them!" <span class="cmt_word">For then would</span> <span class="cmt_word">I fly away, and be at rest.</span> The desire of "rest" is universal. Whatever the delights of action, they can only charm us for a time. In our hearts we are always longing to have done with action, and to be at rest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/55-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
