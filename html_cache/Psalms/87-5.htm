It represents the spiritual and physical center of God's kingdom on earth. In the Old Testament, Zion is the site of the Temple, the dwelling place of God among His people. This phrase indicates a future proclamation, suggesting a time when Zion will be recognized for its divine significance. The prophetic nature of this statement points to the eschatological hope of Zion's ultimate redemption and glory, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>.<p><b>&#8220;This one and that one were born in her,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the idea of spiritual rebirth and belonging. It suggests that people from various backgrounds will be considered native to Zion, highlighting the inclusivity of God's kingdom. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament teaching that believers, regardless of their ethnic or cultural origins, are born again into the family of God (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and the Most High Himself will establish her.&#8221;</b><br>The term "Most High" is a title for God, emphasizing His supreme authority and power. This phrase assures that Zion's establishment is not by human effort but by divine intervention. It underscores God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. The establishment of Zion by God Himself is a theme echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/14-32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a>, and points to the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>. This also typifies Christ, who is the cornerstone of the spiritual Zion, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, Zion is a symbol of God's chosen city and His dwelling place.
