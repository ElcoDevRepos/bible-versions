In biblical context, "ascribe" means to attribute or give credit. The glory due to God's name reflects His character and deeds, as seen throughout Scripture. In <a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5-7</a>, God reveals His name and character to Moses, emphasizing His mercy, grace, and justice. The call to ascribe glory is a reminder of the first commandment, to have no other gods before Him (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), highlighting the exclusivity of worship due to God alone. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus teaches the Lord's Prayer, beginning with "hallowed be Your name" (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>), reinforcing the sanctity and reverence of God's name.<p><b>bring an offering</b><br>In ancient Israel, offerings were a central part of worship, symbolizing devotion, thanksgiving, and atonement. The Levitical system outlined various offerings, such as burnt offerings, grain offerings, and peace offerings (Leviticus 1-7). These offerings were not merely ritualistic but were expressions of the worshiper's heart and acknowledgment of God's provision and forgiveness. The act of bringing an offering signifies a tangible expression of worship and gratitude. In the New Testament, the concept of offering evolves with the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrificial system.<p><b>and enter His courts.</b><br>The courts refer to the temple courts in Jerusalem, the designated place for worship and sacrifice. The temple was the center of Jewish religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Entering His courts implies coming into God's presence with reverence and humility. <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a> echoes this sentiment, encouraging believers to "enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise." In the New Testament, the concept of God's presence expands with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, making believers themselves temples of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological vision in Revelation, where believers from every nation worship God in His eternal presence (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is worthy of glory and worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_courts.htm">His Courts</a></b><br>Refers to the temple courts, a place of worship and offering in ancient Israel, symbolizing the presence of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to David, who calls the people to worship and honor God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/ascribing_glory_to_god.htm">Ascribing Glory to God</a></b><br>Recognize that giving glory to God is an acknowledgment of His supreme worth and majesty.<br><br>Reflect on how your daily actions and words can ascribe glory to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/bringing_offerings.htm">Bringing Offerings</a></b><br>Understand offerings as both physical and spiritual acts of worship.<br><br>Consider what personal sacrifices or offerings you can bring to God today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/entering_his_courts.htm">Entering His Courts</a></b><br>Appreciate the privilege of entering God's presence through worship and prayer.<br><br>Cultivate a heart of reverence and gratitude when approaching God in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_the_lord.htm">The Name of the LORD</a></b><br>Explore the significance of God's name, which represents His character and deeds.<br><br>Ensure that your life reflects the holiness and glory of God's name.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_96_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 96:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_the_LORD_daily_2.htm">How can we "ascribe to the LORD the glory" in our daily lives?
