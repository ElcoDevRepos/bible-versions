In biblical context, water often symbolizes chaos and disorder, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The personification of waters "seeing" God suggests His sovereignty over creation. This can be connected to the parting of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>, where the waters obeyed God's command, demonstrating His authority and power.<p><b>the waters saw You and swirled;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the reaction of the waters to God's presence. The swirling of waters can be seen as a metaphor for the turmoil and upheaval that occurs when God intervenes in the natural order. This imagery is reminiscent of the Flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>, where the waters covered the earth as a form of divine judgment. It also foreshadows the calming of the storm by Jesus in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, where He demonstrates His divine authority over nature.<p><b>even the depths were shaken.</b><br>The "depths" refer to the deep waters or the sea, often seen as a place of mystery and danger in ancient Near Eastern culture. The shaking of the depths signifies a profound disturbance, indicating that God's presence affects even the most hidden and powerful parts of creation. This can be linked to <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>, where the prophet describes being in the depths of the sea, and to <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where the sea is no more, symbolizing the removal of chaos in the new creation. The shaking also points to the eschatological shaking of the heavens and the earth in <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>, highlighting God's ultimate control over all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose presence and power are acknowledged by the natural world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waters.htm">The Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of chaos and disorder, often representing the sea or large bodies of water in biblical literature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_depths.htm">The Depths</a></b><br>Refers to the deep parts of the sea, emphasizing the profound impact of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>The verse highlights God's supreme authority over the natural world.

The psalmist is grounding his faith in a real, historical deliverance&#8212;God&#8217;s parting of the Red Sea&#8212;demonstrating that nothing in the natural realm can resist Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the waters saw You and swirled</b><p>When Asaph repeats the phrase and adds &#8220;and swirled,&#8221; he emphasizes the violent, restless movement that followed God&#8217;s approach.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-17</a> recounts Jordan&#8217;s waters &#8220;standing in a heap&#8221; at God&#8217;s command.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6-7</a> says the waters &#8220;fled&#8221; and &#8220;rushed away&#8221; when God rebuked them.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a> describes the end-times upheaval where earth and sea again convulse at His voice.<p>This churning is not poetic exaggeration; it mirrors the chaotic surge described in <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a> when the waters collapsed on Pharaoh&#8217;s army.

When God steps in, even those concealed realms quake. No force, visible or invisible, can withstand Him. For Asaph, this memory fuels confidence that the God who once shook the depths can still intervene in the present crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a> recalls the Red Sea miracle to highlight God&#8217;s unrivaled sovereignty. Creation itself&#8212;surface waters, swirling currents, hidden depths&#8212;responds instinctively to its Lord. By rehearsing this concrete act of salvation, Asaph encourages believers in every age: the God who once made seas tremble still reigns, still delivers, and still commands every element in His universe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/77.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16-20) The prominence given to Joseph is a feature common to the Asaphic psalm.

But most commentators see in the passage a most essential portion of the poem. It is the thought of the deliverance from Egypt that especially sustains and comforts the psalmist in his extreme distress. The passage is prepared for by vers. 11 and 14, and is exegetical of ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">They were afraid.</span> They shrank from the sight of God, and made a way for his people to pass over. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">depths also were troubled</span>.
