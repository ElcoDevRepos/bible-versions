The "right hand" signifies God's power and authority, emphasizing His active role in establishing and nurturing Israel. The imagery of planting suggests intentionality and care, reflecting God's covenant relationship with His people. This metaphor also connects to the Promised Land, a place where God "planted" Israel to grow and flourish. The root implies a foundation or beginning, indicating that Israel's existence and sustenance are due to God's sovereign will.<p><b>the son You have raised up for Yourself</b><br>This phrase can be seen as a reference to Israel as God's "firstborn son" (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), highlighting the special relationship between God and His chosen people. The term "raised up" suggests elevation and purpose, indicating that Israel was established to fulfill God's divine plan. In a prophetic sense, this can also be seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate "Son" whom God raised up for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>).
