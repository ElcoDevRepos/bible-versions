The Hebrew word for pride here suggests arrogance and self-reliance, which are contrary to the humility required to seek God. This pride blinds the wicked to their need for God, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The cultural context of ancient Israel emphasized community and reliance on God, contrasting with the self-centeredness of the wicked. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of the folly of human pride, as seen in the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where humanity's pride led them to seek independence from God.<p><b>in all his schemes there is no God.</b><br>The term "schemes" refers to the plans and thoughts of the wicked, which are devoid of any consideration of God. This reflects a worldview where God is irrelevant, similar to the fool in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a> who says in his heart, "There is no God." The historical context of the psalm suggests a time when the wicked seemed to prosper, leading them to believe they could act without divine consequence. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that ignoring God leads to moral and spiritual decay, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>, where those who do not honor God become futile in their thinking. The absence of God in their plans highlights the ultimate futility and temporary nature of their success, contrasting with the eternal perspective offered through faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents those who live in defiance of God, characterized by pride and self-reliance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure whom the wicked man refuses to seek or acknowledge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/schemes.htm">Schemes</a></b><br>The plans and actions of the wicked, which are devoid of divine consideration or guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride blinds individuals to their need for God, leading them to rely on their own understanding and strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_absence_of_god_in_planning.htm">The Absence of God in Planning</a></b><br>When God is absent from our plans, we risk pursuing paths that lead to spiritual and moral failure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god.htm">The Importance of Seeking God</a></b><br>Actively seeking God is crucial for a life aligned with His will and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognizing God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Acknowledging God's presence in our lives helps us to remain humble and dependent on His guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_ignoring_god.htm">The Consequences of Ignoring God</a></b><br>Ignoring God leads to a life of futility and ultimately, judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_10_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 10:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_10_4_Wicked_ignore_God.htm">How does Psalm 10:4 describe the mindset of the wicked toward God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_prideful_thoughts.htm">What practical steps can we take to avoid prideful thinking like in Psalm 10:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_10_4_Prov_3_5-6_on_trust.htm">How does Psalm 10:4 relate to Proverbs 3:5-6 about trusting God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_God_vital_in_daily_choices.htm">Why is acknowledging God essential in our daily decision-making, according to Psalm 10:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Encourage_seeking_God_counter_Psalm_10_4.htm">How can we encourage others to seek God, countering the attitude in Psalm 10:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Psalm_10_4_say_wicked_avoid_God.htm">Why does Psalm 10:4 say the wicked do not seek God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_10_4_vs_inherent_human_goodness.htm">How does Psalm 10:4 challenge the belief in inherent human goodness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_10_4.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 10:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_pride.htm">What does the Bible say about pride?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_narcissism.htm">What does the Bible say about narcissism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_54_3_align_with_science.htm">How does Psalm 54:3&#8217;s mention of God &#8220;not being before them&#8221; align with scientific or naturalistic views on divine intervention? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/where_can_wise_counsel_be_found.htm">What does the Bible say about disbelief in God?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 10:4 Mean</div><b>In his pride</b><p>&#8226; Pride is a heart-condition that lifts self above the Lord. &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) and &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist highlights pride as the root of the problem.

The construction is concise to abruptness, and it is hard to determine the ellipses. The passage in the original runs thus: "The wicked, in the height of his scorn - will not require - no God - all his thoughts.' Of the various attempts to supply the ellipses, and obtain a satisfactory sense, the following (that of the 'Speaker's Commentary') is probably the best: "As for the wicked in the height of his scorn - 'God will not require' - 'There is no God' - such are all his thoughts." (Compare the Revised Version, which is not very different.) The general sense is that his pride conducts the wicked man to absolute atheism, or at least to practiced atheism (comp. vers. 11, 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In his pride</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;&#7687;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
