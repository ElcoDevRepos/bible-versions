Envy is a feeling of discontent or covetousness with regard to another's advantages, success, or possessions. The Bible warns against envy in passages like <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>, which states that envy rots the bones. The "arrogant" refers to those who are prideful and self-reliant, often dismissing God&#8217;s authority. This struggle is not unique to the psalmist; it reflects a common human experience, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a>), where envy led to sin. The psalmist's honesty in admitting this feeling is a reminder of the importance of self-examination and confession.<p><b>when I saw the prosperity of the wicked</b><br>The psalmist observes the success and wealth of those who do not follow God's ways, which is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as in Job and Ecclesiastes. The "wicked" are those who live in opposition to God's commandments, yet they seem to thrive. This apparent contradiction challenges the belief that God rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked, a central tenet in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The prosperity of the wicked is a test of faith for believers, as it can lead to doubt about God's justice. This theme is also addressed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the temporary nature of earthly wealth and the eternal value of spiritual riches (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The psalmist's observation serves as a reminder to focus on eternal rewards rather than temporary, worldly success.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite musician appointed by King David to lead worship in the tabernacle.
