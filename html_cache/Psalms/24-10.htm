In the context of ancient Israel, a king was a central figure of authority and power. The term "King of Glory" emphasizes God's supreme majesty and honor. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's kingship, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>. The question also serves to provoke awe and reverence, encouraging believers to contemplate the divine nature and attributes of God.<p><b>The LORD of Hosts&#8212;</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" (Yahweh Sabaoth) signifies God's command over the heavenly armies and all creation. This title underscores His omnipotence and sovereignty, often used in contexts of divine intervention and protection (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>). It reflects the belief in God's ultimate authority over both spiritual and earthly realms. Historically, this would resonate with the Israelites, who understood God as their protector and leader in battles, as seen in the narratives of the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>He is the King of Glory.</b><br>This affirmation answers the preceding question, declaring unequivocally that the LORD is the King of Glory. It reinforces the idea of God's unmatched splendor and authority. The repetition of "King of Glory" emphasizes the central theme of the psalm, which is the recognition of God's majestic rule. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who is also referred to as the King of Kings in <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, highlighting the continuity of God's kingship through Jesus.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to pause and reflect on the preceding words. It suggests a moment of contemplation, allowing the weight and significance of God's glory and kingship to sink in. In the context of worship, it serves as a cue for meditation, emphasizing the importance of internalizing the truths expressed in the psalm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_glory.htm">King of Glory</a></b><br>This title refers to God, emphasizing His majesty, power, and sovereign rule over all creation.
