This delight in the law is a recurring theme in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, emphasizing the importance of God's commandments as a source of joy and guidance. The Hebrew word for "delight" suggests a sense of pleasure and satisfaction, indicating that the psalmist finds true contentment in God's instructions. This delight is not merely intellectual but involves the heart and soul, reflecting a personal relationship with God. The law serves as a foundation for moral and spiritual life, providing wisdom and direction. In the broader biblical context, delighting in God's law is seen as a mark of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>) and is contrasted with the way of the wicked.<p><b>then I would have perished in my affliction</b><br>The psalmist acknowledges that without the sustaining power of God's law, he would have succumbed to his troubles. The term "perished" implies a complete downfall or destruction, highlighting the severity of the affliction faced. This affliction could be understood as any form of suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, that threatens one's well-being. The historical context of the psalm suggests that the author may have been experiencing persecution or hardship, common themes in the lives of the faithful throughout the Old Testament. The law provides not only guidance but also comfort and hope in times of distress. This reliance on God's word for survival is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/94-19.htm">Psalm 94:19</a>, where God's consolations bring joy amid anxiety. The psalmist's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also found strength in God's word during His earthly ministry, particularly in times of trial and temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and reliance on God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the law, whose statutes provide guidance and comfort to the psalmist.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/affliction.htm">Affliction</a></b><br>The unspecified trials or sufferings faced by the psalmist, which are overcome through delight in God's law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/delight_in_god's_law.htm">Delight in God's Law</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "delight" (sha'ashuim) suggests a deep, abiding pleasure.
