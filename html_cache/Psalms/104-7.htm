The term "rebuke" suggests a command that enforces order, similar to Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, demonstrating His divine authority. The imagery of waters fleeing at God's command can also be linked to the parting of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, where God delivers Israel from Egypt, showcasing His control over natural elements. This act of divine intervention is a recurring theme, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the obedience of creation to His will.<p><b>at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away&#8212;</b><br>Thunder is often associated with God's voice and presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. It symbolizes His majesty and power, instilling awe and reverence. The waters "hurrying away" at the sound of thunder can be seen as a metaphor for God's ability to bring order out of chaos, a theme prevalent in the Psalms and prophetic literature. This imagery also connects to the eschatological visions in Revelation, where natural phenomena accompany divine judgment and renewal (<a href="/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>). The use of thunder here underscores the immediacy and effectiveness of God's command, reinforcing His ultimate authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose power and authority are demonstrated through His rebuke and the sound of His thunder.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/waters.htm">Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of chaos and disorder, which are brought into order by God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebuke.htm">Rebuke</a></b><br>Represents God's authoritative command over creation, emphasizing His sovereignty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thunder.htm">Thunder</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's power and presence, often associated with His voice in the Old Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>, which celebrates God's creative work and His ongoing sustenance of the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God has ultimate authority over all aspects of creation, including the natural elements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Understand that God's word is powerful and effective, capable of bringing order out of chaos.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_control.htm">Trust in God's Control</a></b><br>In times of personal chaos or disorder, trust in God's ability to bring peace and order through His sovereign will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_nature.htm">God's Presence in Nature</a></b><br>See the natural world as a testament to God's power and presence, prompting worship and reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_authority.htm">Responding to God's Authority</a></b><br>Reflect on how we respond to God's authority in our lives, ensuring that we submit to His will and commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_104_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 104:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_7_God_s_power_over_nature.htm">How does Psalm 104:7 demonstrate God's power over creation and nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_authority_in_Psalm_104_7.htm">What does "at Your rebuke" in Psalm 104:7 reveal about God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_104_7_daily.htm">How can we apply God's control in Psalm 104:7 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_104_7_to_God_s_nature_control.htm">Connect Psalm 104:7 with another scripture showing God's command over the natural world.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_7_Trust_in_God_s_sovereignty.htm">How does understanding Psalm 104:7 strengthen our trust in God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_7_vs_science_natural_events.htm">How does Psalm 104:7 align with scientific explanations of natural phenomena?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_104_7.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 104:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_7_Literal_or_metaphorical.htm">Does Psalm 104:7 support a literal or metaphorical interpretation of creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_104.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 104?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_104_9_conflict_with_sea-level_data.htm">Does the boundary 'that the waters might not again cover the earth' (Psalm 104:9) conflict with evidence of sea-level changes over time?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/psalm_87_7__how_are_all_'springs'_in_zion.htm">Psalm 87:7 - In what sense are all 'springs' in Zion, given that historically rivers and water sources are not exclusive to Jerusalem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_no_proof_of_a_global_flood.htm">Psalm 29:10 mentions the Lord sitting enthroned over the flood;

&#8220;Rebuke&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s sovereign command; His voice alone is enough to rearrange creation.<p>&#8226; Cross references reinforce this theme:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>, &#8220;He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>, &#8220;He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He makes all the rivers run dry.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a> &#8211; 10, God&#8217;s word gathered the waters so dry land would appear; <a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> looks back to that same creative authority.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: The Lord&#8217;s correction is never empty; it carries real, observable power in nature and in our lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the waters fled</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fled&#8221;

Thunder often symbolizes God&#8217;s majestic voice (<a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Here it reminds us that His authority is both awesome and audible&#8212;He is not distant or silent.<p>&#8226; The same thunder guided Israel at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) and overcame enemies in <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>.<p>&#8226; Application: God continues to speak clearly through Scripture, bringing both comfort and holy fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they hurried away</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a> affirms, &#8220;I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Lesson: Creation models the proper response&#8212;swift submission&#8212;inviting believers to obey promptly rather than reluctantly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> celebrates the Creator whose mere rebuke scatters the seas. Every phrase showcases His unrivaled authority: He speaks, and nature sprints to obey. The passage recalls both the original separation of land and sea and the dramatic deliverances at the Red Sea and Jordan. These historical realities assure us that the Lord who commands oceans also governs every detail of our lives. Swift, trusting obedience is the fitting response to such a powerful, personal God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At thy rebuke they fled</span>.
