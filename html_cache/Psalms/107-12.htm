In the context of Israel's history, this can be seen during their time in Egypt as slaves (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>) and later during the Babylonian exile (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17-21</a>). The hard labor serves as a divine tool to break pride and self-reliance, leading people to recognize their dependence on God. This humbling process is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the blessedness of the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>), emphasizing the value of humility before God.<p><b>they stumbled,</b><br>The imagery of stumbling suggests a loss of direction and stability, often used in Scripture to describe spiritual or moral failure (<a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>). In the Old Testament, stumbling is frequently associated with idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments (<a href="/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>). This phrase indicates a consequence of turning away from God, leading to confusion and missteps. In the New Testament, stumbling is also used metaphorically to describe those who reject Christ, the cornerstone (<a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>).<p><b>and there was no one to help.</b><br>This phrase underscores the isolation and helplessness experienced when God's people are estranged from Him. In the historical context, Israel often found itself without allies or support when it turned away from God, as seen during the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-7</a>). The absence of help highlights the futility of relying on human strength or foreign powers instead of God. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate helper and savior, offering redemption and support to those who turn to Him (<a href="/hebrews/13-6.htm">Hebrews 13:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, representing God's chosen people who experienced various trials and deliverances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A symbolic place of testing and humbling for the Israelites, reflecting their journey and struggles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine orchestrator of events, who uses circumstances to humble and teach His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivity.htm">Captivity</a></b><br>A historical context where the Israelites often found themselves due to disobedience, leading to their humbling and eventual deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, who recounts the experiences of the Israelites to teach and remind the people of God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_humbling.htm">The Purpose of Humbling</a></b><br>God uses difficult circumstances to humble us, not to harm us, but to bring us closer to Him and to refine our character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>When we find ourselves with "no one to help," it is an opportunity to turn to God, who is our ultimate helper and deliverer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Pride leads to stumbling, as seen in the Israelites' history.

Scripture consistently shows that:<p>&#8226; Physical or circumstantial hardship exposes spiritual need (<a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s chastening, though painful, &#8220;yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness&#8221; to those trained by it (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Even daily work can become heavy when hearts resist God, as <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6-11</a> illustrates.<p>Hard labor, then, is not divine cruelty but divine remedy, steering hearts back to the Giver of rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They stumbled</b><p>Next we read, &#8220;they stumbled.&#8221; Once self-reliance collapses, the human condition is laid bare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a> pictures blind men &#8220;stumbling at midday as in the twilight,&#8221; a vivid portrait of sin&#8217;s disorientation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> shows that stumbling can precede deliverance when foes &#8220;stumbled and fell.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a> applies the idea nationally to Israel, explaining that stumbling is not meant to be permanent but to open the door for mercy.<p>Stumbling is both consequence and catalyst&#8212;exposing weakness so that grace may intervene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And there was no one to help</b><p>Finally, the verse concludes, &#8220;and there was no one to help.&#8221; Human resources are exhausted; only God remains.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a> records David&#8217;s cry: &#8220;No one cares for my soul,&#8221; yet the very next line turns to the LORD as his refuge.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a> laments Jerusalem&#8217;s abandonment, stressing that earthly allies can evaporate.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> promises that &#8220;the LORD will vindicate His people when He sees that their strength is gone.&#8221;<p>When every prop is kicked away, God alone stands ready to save (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/107-12.htm">Psalm 107:12</a> traces a downward spiral orchestrated by a loving God: humbling, hard labor, stumbling, isolation.

The verse prepares the reader for the repeated refrain of the psalm: &#8220;Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress&#8221; (v. 13). God&#8217;s purpose in every hardship is restoration.
