In the Old Testament, the sanctuary often refers to the tabernacle or temple, where God's presence dwelt among His people. This setting underscores the authority and sacredness of the proclamation. The sanctuary represents God's holiness and His covenant relationship with Israel, reminding the reader of the divine authority behind the words spoken.<p><b>I will triumph!</b><br>This declaration of victory reflects God's sovereignty and assurance of success over His enemies. It is a statement of divine power and control over the nations. The triumph is not just a military victory but also a spiritual one, signifying God's ultimate plan and purpose being fulfilled. This echoes other biblical passages where God promises victory to His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, where Moses and the Israelites sing of God's triumph over Pharaoh's army.<p><b>I will parcel out Shechem:</b><br>Shechem is a significant city in biblical history, located in the hill country of Ephraim. It was a central location for the patriarchs, including Abraham and Jacob, and later became a city of refuge. The mention of Shechem here symbolizes God's control over the land and His intention to distribute it according to His will. This act of parcelling out land is reminiscent of the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as seen in the book of Joshua.<p><b>and apportion the Valley of Succoth:</b><br>The Valley of Succoth is located east of the Jordan River, near the Jabbok River. It was an area where Jacob settled temporarily after reconciling with Esau. The mention of Succoth alongside Shechem indicates God's dominion over both sides of the Jordan, encompassing the entire land promised to Israel. This apportioning signifies God's promise to give His people the land and His ability to fulfill His covenant promises. The reference to these specific locations highlights the historical and geographical reality of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, speaking from His sanctuary, indicating divine authority and sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>Represents the holy place where God dwells and speaks from, symbolizing His presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>An ancient city in the land of Canaan, significant in Israel's history as a place of covenant and inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_succoth.htm">Valley of Succoth</a></b><br>A location east of the Jordan River, associated with Israel's journey and settlement in the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/triumph.htm">Triumph</a></b><br>The declaration of victory and divine intervention, emphasizing God's power and control over nations and lands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all nations and events.

This declaration is therefore not wishful thinking but a settled decree.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear when the Lord addressed Moses &#8220;above the mercy seat&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>) and when Isaiah saw Him &#8220;high and exalted&#8221; in the temple (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). God&#8217;s sanctified setting reinforces His moral purity and covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will triumph!</b><p>&#8226; The triumph is God&#8217;s own&#8212;not merely Israel&#8217;s. In <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6&#8211;12</a> (the source passage echoed here) David records the same assurance: &#8220;With God we will perform with valor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly attributes victory to the Lord: &#8220;The battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>); &#8220;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>); &#8220;In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the promise issues from God&#8217;s sanctuary, defeat is impossible; His triumph is as sure as His throne (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will parcel out Shechem</b><p>&#8226; Shechem sits in the heart of Canaan, where Abraham first built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6&#8211;7</a>) and where Joshua later gathered Israel to renew covenant vows (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;parcel out&#8221; means God alone determines boundaries (<a href="/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>). Land allotment is both legal and relational&#8212;granting inheritance while proving His fidelity to earlier promises (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Shechem, God highlights territory already inside Israel&#8217;s control, reminding them that every acre remains His possession (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>) and can be reassigned at His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and apportion the Valley of Succoth</b><p>&#8226; Succoth lies east of the Jordan, linked to Jacob&#8217;s journey (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>) and Gideon&#8217;s campaign (<a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4&#8211;9</a>). Mentioning both Shechem (west) and Succoth (east) brackets the land, proclaiming comprehensive sovereignty.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Apportion&#8221; stresses measured, intentional distribution&#8212;no random conquest. <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12&#8211;17</a> records a similar east-side allotment, illustrating God&#8217;s consistent pattern of providing for each tribe.<p>&#8226; By pairing these sites, God assures the nation that from the central hills to the fringe valleys, His victorious rule organizes every boundary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/108-7.htm">Psalm 108:7</a> unfolds as a divine declaration: from His holy throne, God guarantees victory and exercises absolute rights over the land, carefully assigning regions from Shechem&#8217;s central heights to Succoth&#8217;s eastern plain.
