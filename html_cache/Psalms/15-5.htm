These laws were designed to protect the poor and prevent exploitation. Charging interest to fellow Israelites was prohibited, emphasizing community support and compassion. This principle reflects God's character of mercy and justice, encouraging believers to act selflessly and prioritize the well-being of others over personal gain. The practice of lending without interest is a call to trust in God's provision rather than relying on financial gain.<p><b>and refuses a bribe against the innocent</b><br>Bribery was a common issue in ancient Near Eastern societies, often leading to corruption and injustice. The refusal to accept a bribe is a commitment to integrity and justice, aligning with the biblical call to uphold righteousness. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a> warns against perverting justice through bribery, highlighting its destructive impact on society. This phrase underscores the importance of maintaining moral integrity and protecting the innocent, reflecting God's justice and righteousness. It calls believers to be impartial and fair, mirroring God's character in their dealings with others.<p><b>He who does these things will never be shaken</b><br>This promise of stability and security is a recurring theme in the Psalms, often associated with those who live righteously and follow God's commandments. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> and <a href="/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a> echo this assurance, portraying the righteous as firmly established and unmovable. The imagery of being "never shaken" suggests a life built on a solid foundation, resilient against life's challenges. This stability is not merely physical but spiritual, rooted in a relationship with God. It points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the cornerstone and foundation of faith, offering eternal security to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>, King David, is traditionally understood to be the writer.

So here the context plainly seems to limit the sin of usury to unjust application of the principle, being connected with bribery. Against "biting" usury (the Hebrew word primarily means "bite") all governments find it necessary to legislate, as we see in the case of the money-lenders of our own time; but with the employment of capital put out on interest for legitimate purposes of trade, neither Hebrew feeling generally, as the whole career of the race shows, nor the higher minds among them, as we see by our Lord's parable of the talents, were averse. The best illustrations of invectives of prophets and psalmists against extortionate usurers are supplied by Shakespeare's play, <span class= "ital">The Merchant of Venice.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not out his money to usury</span>.
