In the context of <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, which is attributed to Solomon, it reflects the hope for a stable and enduring reign. The wish for a long life is common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where the king's well-being was seen as directly linked to the nation's prosperity. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, pointing to the eternal reign of Jesus, the King of Kings, whose kingdom will have no end (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<p><b>May gold from Sheba be given him.</b><br>Sheba, likely located in the region of modern-day Yemen, was known for its wealth and trade in precious commodities like gold and spices. The mention of gold from Sheba signifies the king's international recognition and the tribute paid to him by other nations. This reflects the historical context of Solomon's reign, during which he received gifts from foreign dignitaries, including the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-10</a>). Prophetically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Magi bringing gifts to Jesus, acknowledging His kingship (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p><b>May people ever pray for him;</b><br>The call for continual prayer for the king underscores the importance of divine guidance and support in his rule. In ancient Israel, the king was seen as God's representative, and his success was believed to be dependent on God's favor. This aligns with the biblical principle of praying for leaders (<a href="/1_timothy/2.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>). It also highlights the communal responsibility of the people to intercede for their ruler, ensuring that his reign aligns with God's will.<p><b>may they bless him all day long.</b><br>The desire for the king to be blessed continually reflects the hope for his reign to be marked by justice, peace, and prosperity. In the biblical context, blessings are often associated with God's favor and the fulfillment of His promises. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, whose reign brings blessings to all who are under His lordship. The continuous nature of the blessing suggests an unending acknowledgment of the king's role and the benefits of his righteous leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Solomon, this psalm is a prayer for the king, reflecting the ideal reign of a righteous and prosperous king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba.htm">Sheba</a></b><br>A region known for its wealth, particularly in gold.
