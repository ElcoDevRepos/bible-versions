In the Old Testament, blessings often signify God's covenantal faithfulness, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The concept of blessing is deeply rooted in the Hebrew understanding of God's provision and protection. It reflects the idea that all good things come from God, aligning with <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which states that every good and perfect gift is from above.<p><b>and they multiply greatly;</b><br>Multiplication here refers to both population growth and prosperity. This echoes the blessings given to the patriarchs, such as God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). In a historical context, population growth was a sign of divine favor and strength, crucial for survival and influence in the ancient Near East. This multiplication can also be seen as a type of spiritual growth and expansion of God's kingdom, as seen in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>).<p><b>He does not let their herds diminish.</b><br>In an agrarian society, herds were a primary measure of wealth and sustenance. The protection and increase of livestock signify God's provision and care for the material needs of His people. This assurance of not letting herds diminish reflects God's promise of sustenance and abundance, similar to His provision for Israel in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also connects to the idea of God as a shepherd, a theme prevalent in Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God provides and cares for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Psalms, often reflecting on their history and relationship with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who reflects on God's faithfulness and provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of testing and reliance on God, often referenced in the Psalms as a backdrop for God's deliverance and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's blessings and abundance, contrasting with the wilderness experience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_blessing.htm">God's Blessing</a></b><br>A recurring theme in the Psalms, emphasizing God's provision and care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_blessing_and_multiplication.htm">God's Blessing and Multiplication</a></b><br>God's blessings lead to growth and abundance.
