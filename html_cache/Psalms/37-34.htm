Waiting for the LORD involves trusting in His timing and sovereignty, a recurring theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>). Keeping His way refers to living according to God's commandments and moral laws, as outlined in the Torah. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The call to wait and keep His way is a reminder of the faithfulness required of believers, echoing the patience of figures like Abraham, who waited for God's promises (<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>).<p><b>and He will raise you up to inherit the land</b><br>This promise connects to the Abrahamic Covenant, where God promised land to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). In the historical context, the land represents not just physical territory but also spiritual blessings and rest. The phrase "raise you up" suggests divine intervention and elevation, akin to how God raised Joseph from prison to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-43</a>). For Christians, this can be seen as a type of the eternal inheritance promised through Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), where the "land" symbolizes the Kingdom of God.<p><b>When the wicked are cut off, you will see it</b><br>This phrase assures the eventual justice and vindication of the righteous. The cutting off of the wicked is a common biblical theme, seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the downfall of Pharaoh's army (<a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>). It reflects the divine retribution that awaits those who oppose God's ways. The promise that "you will see it" provides hope and assurance to the faithful, similar to how the Israelites witnessed the defeat of their enemies. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, where the wicked are eternally separated from God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as the ultimate authority and source of justice and reward.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are called to wait for the LORD and keep His way, representing believers who follow God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose God's ways and will ultimately be cut off, serving as a contrast to the righteous.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's promises and blessings, often representing the inheritance and reward for the faithful.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_exaltation.htm">The Event of Exaltation</a></b><br>The future moment when the righteous will be lifted up and rewarded by God, witnessing the downfall of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_in_god's_timing.htm">Patience in God's Timing</a></b><br>Waiting for the LORD requires trust in His perfect timing and plan.
