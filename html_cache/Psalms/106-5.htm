The concept of "chosen ones" refers to the Israelites, whom God selected as His special people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The prosperity mentioned here is not merely material wealth but encompasses spiritual well-being and divine favor. Historically, Israel experienced periods of prosperity under leaders like David and Solomon, which were seen as a fulfillment of God's promises. This prosperity is also a type of the ultimate blessings found in Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promises to His people (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><b>and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation</b><br>The psalmist expresses a desire to share in the joy and celebration of the nation of Israel. This gladness is rooted in the nation's relationship with God and His acts of deliverance and provision. Throughout Israel's history, there were times of national rejoicing, such as during the feasts and festivals prescribed in the Law (Leviticus 23). These celebrations were not only cultural but deeply spiritual, reflecting God's faithfulness. The joy of the nation is a foretaste of the eternal joy promised to believers in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-4</a>).<p><b>and give glory with Your inheritance</b><br>The phrase "Your inheritance" refers to the people of Israel, whom God considers His treasured possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). The psalmist desires to participate in giving glory to God alongside His people. This act of giving glory is an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, grace, and mighty works. In the New Testament, believers in Christ are also described as God's inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>), expanding this concept to include all who are in Christ. The ultimate fulfillment of giving glory with God's inheritance is seen in the worship of the Lamb by all nations and peoples (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who is expressing a desire to witness and partake in the blessings of God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_chosen_ones.htm">God's Chosen Ones</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's covenant people, chosen to be a light to the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation_of_israel.htm">The Nation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective people of God, often referred to as "Your nation" in the Psalms, representing the community of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>In the Old Testament context, this often refers to the Promised Land, but spiritually it signifies the blessings and promises given to God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prosperity_and_gladness.htm">Prosperity and Gladness</a></b><br>These terms highlight the blessings and joy that come from being in right relationship with God and living according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are part of God's chosen people, called to live in the prosperity of spiritual blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing_in_community.htm">Rejoicing in Community</a></b><br>The joy of the Lord is often experienced in the context of community, emphasizing the importance of fellowship with other believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_heirs.htm">Living as Heirs</a></b><br>Recognize and live out the reality that we are heirs of God's promises, which should influence our daily lives and decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_prosperity.htm">Seeking God's Prosperity</a></b><br>True prosperity is found in aligning our lives with God's will and purposes, rather than worldly measures of success.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebrating_god's_faithfulness.htm">Celebrating God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on and celebrate the ways God has been faithful to His people throughout history and in our personal lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_106_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 106:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_share_in_Your_nation_s_joy_today.htm">How can we "rejoice in the joy of Your nation" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_glory_with_Your_inheritance.htm">What does it mean to "glory with Your inheritance" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_5_and_Abraham_s_promises_link.htm">How does Psalm 106:5 connect with God's promises to Abraham's descendants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spread_God_s_joy_in_our_community.htm">How can we implement the joy of God's people in our community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_are_we_part_of_God_s_inheritance.htm">In what ways can we see ourselves as part of God's inheritance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_5_and_God_s_covenant_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 106:5 reflect God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Psalm_106_5_s_writing.htm">What historical context surrounds the writing of Psalm 106:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_106_5_and_biblical_redemption.htm">How does Psalm 106:5 relate to the theme of redemption in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_106.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 106?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/will_the_meek_inherit_the_earth.htm">Will the meek inherit the earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_bible's_view_on_hope.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on hope?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_inherited_sin_at_birth_valid.htm">Psalm 51:5 -

Verses 2&#8211;4 remember God&#8217;s mighty acts and ask, &#8220;Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor toward Your people; visit me with Your salvation.&#8221; Verse 5 then unfolds the psalmist&#8217;s threefold desire for personal participation in the blessings God pours on His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist longs to witness, firsthand, the tangible well-being God promises to those He has set apart. &#8220;Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Prosperity&#8221; in Scripture often includes spiritual fruitfulness (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>) and material sufficiency (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-12.htm">Deuteronomy 7:12-13</a>). The writer wishes to experience both, not merely hear about them.<p>&#8226; This longing echoes God&#8217;s covenant heart: &#8220;For I know the plans I have for you&#8230; plans to prosper you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).

The psalmist wants to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow heirs, lifting unified praise.<p>&#8226; Redemption&#8217;s purpose is worship: &#8220;You have made us a kingdom and priests to our God&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Giving glory together reflects eternity, when every tribe joins in one anthem (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Here and now, believers &#8220;proclaim the excellencies of Him who called&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).
