In biblical context, God's righteousness is a central theme, reflecting His nature as holy and just. The concept of God as a judge is prevalent throughout Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, where Abraham acknowledges God as the Judge of all the earth. The righteousness of God is also a standard for human conduct, as seen in the Law given to Israel. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ embodies God's righteousness, fulfilling the law and offering salvation through His sacrifice (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>).<p><b>and a God who feels indignation each day</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's emotional response to sin and injustice. The term "indignation" suggests a righteous anger towards wrongdoing, which is consistent with God's holy nature. Throughout the Bible, God's indignation is directed towards sin and idolatry, as seen in the prophets' warnings to Israel (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). This daily indignation underscores God's continual awareness and intolerance of sin. It also points to the eventual judgment that will come upon unrepentant sinners, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. The concept of God's indignation is balanced by His mercy and patience, offering repentance and forgiveness through Jesus Christ (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote psalms during times of distress and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush,_a_benjamite.htm">Cush, a Benjamite</a></b><br>The superscription of <a href="/bsb/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a> mentions Cush, a Benjamite, possibly indicating a specific adversary or situation that prompted David to write this psalm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, described as a righteous judge who experiences indignation daily.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_righteousness.htm">Understanding God's Righteousness</a></b><br>God's righteousness is perfect and unchanging.
