In biblical context, being "before the LORD" signifies standing in His presence, acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. The Israelites understood the importance of approaching God with reverence, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and later the Temple, where God's presence was believed to dwell. This phrase also connects to the idea of worship and submission to God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>, where the people stood before the LORD at Mount Sinai.<p><b>for He comes to judge the earth</b><br>This statement reflects the anticipation of God's intervention in human history. The concept of divine judgment is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who will hold the world accountable. This expectation is rooted in the prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah judging with righteousness. The coming of the LORD to judge is also a future hope for believers, pointing to the eschatological return of Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<p><b>He will judge the world with righteousness</b><br>Righteousness in biblical terms refers to God's perfect moral standard and justice. This phrase assures that God's judgment will be fair and just, unlike human judgments that can be flawed or biased. The righteousness of God's judgment is a theme found throughout the Psalms and the Prophets, such as in <a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-5</a>. It also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ, who is described as the righteous judge in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, emphasizing His sinless nature and perfect justice.<p><b>and the peoples with equity</b><br>Equity here denotes fairness and impartiality. God's judgment is not only righteous but also equitable, meaning it is applied equally to all people, regardless of status or background. This reflects the biblical principle that God shows no partiality, as stated in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>. The idea of equitable judgment is comforting to those who seek justice and is a call to live according to God's standards. It also highlights the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, where all nations and peoples are subject to His just rule, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as the ultimate judge who comes to bring justice and righteousness to the earth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The realm over which God exercises His judgment, encompassing all creation and humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the inhabitants of the earth, highlighting the scope of God's righteous judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>All nations and ethnic groups, emphasizing the universal nature of God's equitable judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_event.htm">Judgment Event</a></b><br>The anticipated time when God will come to judge the earth, a future event that brings hope and accountability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is characterized by righteousness, meaning it is fair, just, and in accordance with His holy nature.
