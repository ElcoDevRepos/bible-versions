In biblical context, the "hand" of God often symbolizes His power and presence. The imagery of God's hand sustaining someone is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God promises to uphold His people with His righteous right hand. This assurance of support is a recurring theme in the Psalms, reflecting God's faithfulness to His covenant people. Historically, this would resonate with the Israelites, who understood their survival and success as directly linked to God's intervention and support. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is sustained by the Father throughout His earthly ministry, especially during His trials and crucifixion.<p><b>surely My arm will strengthen him.</b><br>The "arm" of God is a metaphor for His mighty power and ability to deliver and protect. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the arm was a symbol of strength and authority. This phrase emphasizes God's active role in empowering and fortifying His chosen servant. In the broader biblical narrative, God's arm is often associated with acts of deliverance, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This can also be seen as prophetic, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is empowered by God to fulfill His mission of salvation. The strengthening of God's servant is a theme that underscores the divine enablement necessary for accomplishing God's purposes, as seen in the life of David, the likely subject of this Psalm, and ultimately in the life of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is believed to be a wise man during the time of Solomon.
