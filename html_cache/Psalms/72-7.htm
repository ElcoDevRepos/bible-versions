The flourishing of the righteous suggests a society where justice prevails, aligning with the biblical theme of God's kingdom being established on earth. The "righteous" are those who live according to God's laws, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. This echoes the reign of Solomon, who is traditionally associated with wisdom and justice, and serves as a type of Christ, the ultimate righteous king. The flourishing of the righteous is also reminiscent of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>and prosperity abound</b><br>Prosperity in this context is not merely material wealth but encompasses spiritual well-being and societal harmony. The Hebrew word for prosperity, "shalom," implies completeness and peace. This abundance is a sign of God's favor and blessing, often linked to the covenant promises made to Abraham and David. The idea of prosperity abounding under a righteous ruler is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the reigns of David and Solomon, and points forward to the eschatological hope of the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21-22</a>, where God's people will experience eternal peace and prosperity.<p><b>until the moon is no more</b><br>This phrase suggests an everlasting reign, as the moon is a symbol of time and continuity. The imagery of the moon ceasing to exist conveys the idea of eternity, indicating that the prosperity and righteousness under this king will endure forever. This eternal aspect is often associated with the messianic kingdom, where Christ's reign will have no end, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and affirmed in <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>. The phrase underscores the permanence of God's promises and the ultimate fulfillment of His plan for creation, where the righteous will dwell in everlasting peace and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Solomon, this psalm is a royal prayer for the king, seeking divine blessing and justice during his reign.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Refers to those who live in accordance with God's will and commandments, experiencing flourishing and prosperity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>While initially referring to Solomon, this can also be seen as a messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ, the ultimate righteous king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_moon.htm">The Moon</a></b><br>Symbolizes time and eternity, indicating the enduring nature of the blessings and prosperity under the righteous king's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigned, representing God's chosen people who benefit from the king's righteous rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_leads_to_flourishing.htm">Righteousness Leads to Flourishing</a></b><br>The psalm emphasizes that true prosperity is linked to righteousness.
