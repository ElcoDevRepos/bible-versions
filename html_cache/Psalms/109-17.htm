In biblical context, curses were serious invocations of divine judgment or misfortune, often reflecting the covenantal blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The psalmist, traditionally identified as David, is calling for the wicked man's own love of cursing to become his reality. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, where it states, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." Theologically, this can be seen as a call for divine justice, where the wicked receive the consequences of their own actions.<p><b>the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.</b><br>In contrast to the curses, blessings in the biblical sense often refer to God's favor and provision. The refusal to delight in blessings suggests a rejection of God's goodness and grace. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-31</a>, where wisdom is rejected, leading to calamity. The historical context of blessings and curses in Israelite society was deeply tied to their covenant relationship with God, where obedience brought blessings and disobedience brought curses. Theologically, this phrase underscores the importance of valuing and seeking God's blessings, as seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus pronounces blessings on those who embody kingdom values. The absence of delight in blessings can be seen as a spiritual blindness or hardness of heart, which ultimately leads to separation from God's favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and imprecation against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals who are the subject of David's imprecations, characterized by their love of cursing and rejection of blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and the one to whom David appeals for justice against his adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to bless or curse.
