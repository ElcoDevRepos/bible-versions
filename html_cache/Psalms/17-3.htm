In biblical context, the heart often symbolizes the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. The testing of the heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>, where God searches the heart and examines the mind. This divine scrutiny is not merely for judgment but also for refining and purifying the believer, akin to the refining of gold in fire (<a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>).<p><b>You have visited me in the night.</b><br>The night is often a time associated with vulnerability and introspection. In ancient Near Eastern culture, nighttime was a period when people were most defenseless, and thus, divine visitation during this time signifies God's protective and intimate presence. This phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for times of trial or darkness in one's life, where God's presence is a source of comfort and guidance. The idea of God visiting His people is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11-12</a>, where even the darkness is not dark to God.<p><b>You have tested me and found no evil;</b><br>This statement reflects the psalmist's confidence in his integrity and righteousness before God. The testing here implies a thorough examination, similar to the process of refining metals. The absence of evil found in the psalmist suggests a life lived in accordance with God's laws and commands. This echoes Job's assertion of his integrity in <a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>, where he declares that after being tested, he will come forth as gold. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who was tested and found without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>I have resolved not to sin with my mouth.</b><br>The psalmist's resolution highlights the importance of speech and the power of words, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. In the cultural context of the Bible, words were seen as powerful and capable of bringing about significant consequences. This resolve is reminiscent of <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2-10</a>, which discusses the tongue's potential for both blessing and cursing. The commitment to purity in speech reflects a heart aligned with God's will, as Jesus taught that out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). This resolution also prefigures Christ, who spoke only what He heard from the Father (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this Psalm, David is expressing his confidence in God's examination of his heart and his commitment to righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who examines, visits, and tests David, demonstrating His omniscience and intimate involvement in the lives of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_night.htm">The Night</a></b><br>Symbolic of times of vulnerability and introspection, where God&#8217;s presence and examination are keenly felt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_intimacy.htm">God's Omniscience and Intimacy</a></b><br>God knows our innermost thoughts and intentions.

This is not presumption but humble transparency before the One who &#8220;knows the secrets of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-21.htm">Psalm 44:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have visited me in the night</b><p>Night often represents vulnerability and solitude. &#8226; In <a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2</a> God spoke to Jacob &#8220;in visions of the night,&#8221; and in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a> He appeared to Solomon &#8220;in a dream by night.&#8221; These precedents show that nighttime encounters can be moments of intimate revelation. &#8226; David sees the Lord&#8217;s nighttime visitation as proof that God&#8217;s watchful care never ceases (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, &#8220;He who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep&#8221;). Even in the dark, when no human witness is present, God assesses character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have tested me and found no evil</b><p>Here David claims a clear conscience, not sinlessness but blamelessness regarding the accusations he faces. &#8226; Paul echoes this stance in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>, &#8220;My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent; it is the Lord who judges me.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a> reminds us, &#8220;The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tests hearts.&#8221; God&#8217;s verdict carries ultimate weight. David&#8217;s life has been sifted, and the Lord finds no wicked scheme behind his actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have resolved not to sin with my mouth</b><p>David transitions from God&#8217;s examination to his own commitment. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> urges, &#8220;Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech,&#8221; showing that guarded speech is a mark of righteousness. &#8226; <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a> observes, &#8220;If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man,&#8221; linking verbal self-control to mature faith. David&#8217;s resolve reflects proactive obedience; rather than trust in self-discipline alone, he leans on God&#8217;s help to keep his words pure (<a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>, &#8220;Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a> highlights a life laid open before God: tested at the deepest level, watched over even in the dark, declared blameless concerning hidden motives, and committed to purity of speech. The verse invites believers to welcome God&#8217;s searching gaze, rest in His constant oversight, trust His righteous verdicts, and purpose&#8212;by His grace&#8212;to speak only what honors Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">In</span> <span class= "bld">the night </span>(as <a href="/psalms/16-7.htm" title="I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.">Psalm 16:7</a>).--The time of calm reflection and self-examination.

"Proved" means "tried," "tested," examined strictly, so as to know whether there was any wickedness in it or not. Thou hast visited me in the night.
