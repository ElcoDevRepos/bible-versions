In the cultural context of ancient Israel, kindness, or "chesed" in Hebrew, was a covenantal loyalty expected among God's people. The absence of kindness signifies a complete withdrawal of community support and divine favor. This plea for justice can be seen in light of the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to a withdrawal of God's blessings. Theologically, this reflects the principle of divine retribution, where those who oppose God's anointed face consequences. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, though innocent, faced abandonment and lack of kindness from those around Him, fulfilling the suffering servant motif in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>and no one to favor his fatherless children</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, fatherless children were among the most vulnerable in society, often relying on community support for survival. The lack of favor or grace towards them underscores the severity of the judgment being called upon the enemy. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has consequences not only for the individual but also for their descendants, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. However, the broader biblical narrative emphasizes God's compassion for orphans, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, where God is described as a "father to the fatherless." This tension highlights the seriousness of opposing God's anointed and the resulting divine justice. In a typological sense, this can be seen in the rejection of Christ, where His followers, often seen as spiritual orphans, initially faced persecution and lack of favor from the world, yet ultimately found favor and adoption into God's family through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and imprecation against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm is a plea for divine justice against those who have wronged David, possibly referring to specific adversaries during his reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fatherless_children.htm">Fatherless Children</a></b><br>Represents the vulnerable and innocent who suffer as a consequence of their parents' actions or the curses pronounced upon them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_imprecatory_psalms.htm">Understanding Imprecatory Psalms</a></b><br>These psalms express raw human emotions and a desire for justice.
