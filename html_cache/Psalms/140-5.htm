In biblical context, pride is frequently condemned (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The imagery of a "snare" suggests a trap set to capture or harm, reflecting the deceitful and malicious intentions of the wicked. This aligns with the experiences of David, who faced numerous plots against him, particularly from King Saul (1 Samuel 18-24). The snare metaphor is also used in the New Testament, where Paul warns Timothy about the dangers of falling into the devil's trap (<a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>).<p><b>the cords of their net are spread along the path,</b><br>The "cords of their net" evoke the image of a hunter or fowler laying a net to catch prey, symbolizing the calculated and strategic efforts of the wicked to ensnare the righteous. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the righteous walking a path fraught with dangers and temptations (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).
