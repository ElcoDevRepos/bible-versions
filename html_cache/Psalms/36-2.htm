In biblical context, conceit or pride is often depicted as a barrier to understanding and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The eyes, symbolizing perception and understanding, are clouded by self-importance, preventing the individual from seeing truth. This mirrors the Pharisees' spiritual blindness in the New Testament, who were unable to recognize Jesus as the Messiah due to their own self-righteousness (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).<p><b>to detect</b><br>The inability to detect sin suggests a lack of self-awareness and discernment. Biblically, discernment is a gift from God, allowing individuals to distinguish between right and wrong (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>). The failure to detect sin is often linked to a hardened heart, as seen in Pharaoh's resistance to God's commands in Exodus. This phrase underscores the importance of humility and seeking God's wisdom to truly understand one's spiritual state.<p><b>or hate his own sin</b><br>Hating sin is a recurring theme in Scripture, where believers are called to abhor what is evil (<a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>). The failure to hate one's own sin indicates a deeper issue of unrepentance and a lack of alignment with God's holiness. This reflects the condition of the Israelites in the Old Testament, who repeatedly turned away from God despite His calls for repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>). In contrast, true repentance involves a heartfelt turning away from sin, as exemplified by King David in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>. This phrase serves as a reminder of the need for genuine contrition and the transformative power of God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/36.htm">Psalm 36</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

Scripture links eyesight with moral perception: &#8220;The eye is the lamp of the body&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; When sight is corrupted, everything else follows suit; the heart and actions become skewed (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-4.htm">Proverbs 21:4</a>, &#8220;Haughty eyes and a proud heart&#8212;the lamp of the wicked&#8212;are sin,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are too full of conceit</b><p>&#8226; Pride crowds the field of vision so completely that nothing humbling can break through. &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) and God &#8220;opposes the proud&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s warning underscores the problem: &#8220;Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>). Conceit blinds the sinner to reality, convincing him he needs no correction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to detect or hate</b><p>&#8226; Spiritual pride deadens sensitivity. Jesus said, &#8220;Everyone who practices evil hates the Light&#8230; lest his deeds should be exposed&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The Holy Spirit&#8217;s work is to &#8220;convict the world of sin&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>), yet the conceited man refuses that conviction, so he cannot even recognize (&#8220;detect&#8221;) his wrong, much less loathe (&#8220;hate&#8221;) it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a> warns, &#8220;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,&#8221; showing that self-deception precedes moral paralysis. Genuine love for God produces the opposite response: &#8220;Hate evil, O you who love the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/97-10.htm">Psalm 97:10</a>; cf. <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his own sin</b><p>&#8226; The phrase zeroes in on personal guilt. Sin is not merely an abstract problem; it is &#8220;his own.&#8221; <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a> makes the personal application universal: &#8220;For all have sinned.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pride conceals this personal accountability, but Scripture calls for confession: &#8220;He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> reminds us why pride so easily blinds: &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things.&#8221; Only humble acknowledgment of personal sin opens the way to forgiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a> exposes the tragedy of unchecked pride. When a person&#8217;s perception (&#8220;eyes&#8221;) is flooded with self-importance (&#8220;conceit&#8221;), he becomes unable to recognize or loathe the very wrongdoing that destroys him. Scripture consistently links proud eyesight with spiritual blindness, urging us to reject self-deception, confess our &#8220;own sin,&#8221; and let God&#8217;s light expose and heal what pride tries to hide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">For he flattereth . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">For he </span>(or, <span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> makes smooth to him in his eyes to find out his evil to hate. </span>(See margin.) A sentence of great difficulty. We must seek for the key to the interpretation of these words in the balance of the two phrases, "before his eyes," "in his own eyes," and must take the two verses together. They form, in fact, an example of introverted parallelism. (See Gen. Introduction.)<p>Sin is the wicked man's oracle in his heart;<p>No fear of God is before his eyes;<p>He makes all smooth to himself in his eyes.<p>As to the discovery of his guilt that is his hate;<p>Or,<p>The discovery of his guilt is the only thing he hates.<p>This reading takes the two infinitives as subject and complement with the copula understood.
