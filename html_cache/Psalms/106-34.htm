The command was given to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the idolatrous practices of these nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). Historically, the Canaanites were known for their morally corrupt practices, including child sacrifice and temple prostitution, which were abominations in the sight of God. The Israelites' disobedience led to their eventual spiritual decline, as they adopted the customs and gods of the surrounding nations (<a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>).<p><b>as the LORD had commanded them</b><br>This command from the LORD was part of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. It was not merely a military directive but a spiritual mandate to maintain the purity of worship and devotion to Yahweh. The command is found in several places, including <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a> and <a href="/joshua/11-12.htm">Joshua 11:12-15</a>. The failure to obey this command is seen as a direct violation of God's will, leading to consequences such as oppression by foreign powers and spiritual apostasy. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the need for a faithful remnant and pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father and established a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were commanded to conquer and inhabit the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites.htm">The Canaanites</a></b><br>The peoples inhabiting the land of Canaan, whom God commanded the Israelites to destroy due to their idolatry and wickedness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who gave specific commands regarding the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conquest_of_canaan.htm">The Conquest of Canaan</a></b><br>The historical event where the Israelites, under God's command, were to take possession of the land of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to fully obey God's command to destroy the Canaanites serves as a reminder of the importance of complete obedience to God's instructions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' disobedience led to spiritual and moral compromise, showing that partial obedience is still disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to remove the Canaanites, Christians are called to remove sin from their lives, recognizing the spiritual battle against sin and temptation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's command to destroy the Canaanites reflects His justice and sovereignty, reminding us that His ways and judgments are perfect, even when they are difficult to understand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The call to destroy the Canaanites was also a call to holiness, separating the Israelites from pagan influences.

Israel, once comfortably settled in Palestine, with sufficient room for its numbers, did not carry out the Divine command to "destroy," or "cast out," the Canaanitish nations, but was content to share the land with them. "The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem" (<a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>); "neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns" (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>); "neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer" (<a href="/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>); nor "Zebulon the inhabitants of Kitten, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol" (<a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>); "neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho" (<a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>); nor "Naphtali the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath" (<a href="/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>); nor Dan the Amorites, who "would dwell in Mount Heros in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim" (<a href="/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>). It was not compassion that restrained them, but love of ease, idleness, one of the seven deadly sins; and the results were those described in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/106-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">destroy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#353;&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8045.htm">Strong's 8045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be exterminated or destroyed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the peoples</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
