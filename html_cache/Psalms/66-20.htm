It reflects the psalmist's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and goodness. The act of blessing God is a response to His divine attributes and actions. In the Hebrew tradition, blessing God is an act of worship and gratitude, recognizing His role as the Creator and Sustainer of life. This phrase sets the tone for the rest of the verse, emphasizing the psalmist's gratitude and reverence.<p><b>who has not rejected my prayer</b><br>The psalmist expresses confidence that God has heard and accepted his prayer. In the context of the Old Testament, prayer was a vital part of the relationship between God and His people. The assurance that God has not rejected the prayer suggests a close, personal relationship with God, where the psalmist feels heard and valued. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to listen to His people when they call upon Him. It also connects to New Testament teachings, such as in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14</a>, which assures believers that God hears their prayers when they ask according to His will.<p><b>or withheld from me His loving devotion!</b><br>The term "loving devotion" is often translated from the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness. This concept is central to the understanding of God's character in the Old Testament. The psalmist acknowledges that God's loving devotion is not only a response to prayer but a constant aspect of His nature. This assurance of God's unwavering love is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which speaks of God's mercies being new every morning. The idea of God not withholding His love is a precursor to the New Testament revelation of God's love through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's ultimate act of loving devotion to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is praised for His faithfulness and loving devotion.
