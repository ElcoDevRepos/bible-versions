The "fathers" are the ancestors of the Israelites who repeatedly tested God's patience and faithfulness. This testing is documented in several instances, such as at Massah and Meribah (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>, <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>), where the people quarreled with Moses and doubted God's provision. The testing and trying of God reflect a lack of faith and trust, despite His continuous guidance and miraculous interventions. This behavior is a warning against hardening one's heart and serves as a reminder of the consequences of unbelief.<p><b>though they had seen My work</b><br>Despite witnessing God's mighty works, including the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna and water, the Israelites still doubted and disobeyed. This highlights the human tendency to forget God's past faithfulness and miracles when faced with new challenges. The phrase underscores the importance of remembering and trusting in God's power and provision. It also serves as a typology of Christ, who performed many signs and wonders, yet faced disbelief and rejection. The call is to learn from the past and maintain faith in God's promises and works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the ancestors of the Israelites, particularly those who wandered in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt.
