Biblically, bearing fruit is often associated with living a life that reflects God's will and produces good works (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The imagery of fruitfulness in old age suggests a life that continues to be spiritually productive and influential. This can be seen in the lives of biblical figures like Abraham and Sarah, who were called to significant roles in their advanced years (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>). The concept of bearing fruit in old age also aligns with the promise of longevity and blessing for those who follow God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>).<p><b>healthy and green they will remain,</b><br>The imagery of being "healthy and green" suggests vitality, strength, and resilience. In the Bible, green trees often symbolize life and prosperity (<a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>). This phrase indicates that the righteous will not only continue to be productive but will also maintain their spiritual vigor and health. The use of "green" can also be connected to the idea of being planted by streams of water, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are compared to a tree that yields fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. This reflects a life sustained by a deep, abiding relationship with God. The promise of remaining healthy and green can be seen as a type of the eternal life and renewal found in Jesus Christ, who offers living water that leads to everlasting life (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/92.htm">Psalm 92</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who is expressing praise and thanksgiving to God for His faithfulness and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous.htm">Righteous</a></b><br>The individuals described in this verse, who are living in accordance with God's will and are blessed with continued fruitfulness even in old age.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>Psalm 92 is a song for the Sabbath, indicating its use in temple worship, a place where the community gathered to honor God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_age.htm">Old Age</a></b><br>A stage of life highlighted in this verse, emphasizing the continued vitality and productivity of the righteous.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/flourishing.htm">Flourishing</a></b><br>The imagery of being "healthy and green" suggests a state of spiritual vitality and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/continued_fruitfulness.htm">Continued Fruitfulness</a></b><br>The righteous are promised ongoing productivity and vitality, regardless of age.

The context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/92.htm">Psalm 92</a> (vv. 12-13) has already pictured the righteous &#8220;flourish[ing] like a palm tree&#8230;planted in the house of the LORD,&#8221; so old age is portrayed as the continuation&#8212;not the cessation&#8212;of that flourishing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will still bear fruit</b><p>- The verse goes on: &#8220;they will still bear fruit.&#8221; The language is agricultural, but the fruit is spiritual. Jesus uses the same picture in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>: &#8220;The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit.&#8221;<p>- This fruit shows up as Christlike character and good works. <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a> lists &#8220;love, joy, peace, patience&#8221; and more as &#8220;the fruit of the Spirit,&#8221; while <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a> speaks of being &#8220;filled with the fruit of righteousness.&#8221;<p>- Notice the word &#8220;still.&#8221; Even when energy levels change, the Spirit-empowered believer keeps producing: mentoring younger saints, interceding in prayer, offering seasoned counsel, supporting Kingdom work&#8212;tangible, life-giving fruit that benefits others and glorifies God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Healthy and green they will remain</b><p>- The closing phrase&#8212;&#8220;healthy and green they will remain&#8221;&#8212;borrows the imagery of a tree whose leaves refuse to wither. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> uses the same picture: &#8220;whose leaf does not wither,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a> says the faith-rooted believer&#8217;s &#8220;leaves are always green.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Healthy and green&#8221; points to inner vitality. While bodies age, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a> reminds us, &#8220;Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.&#8221;<p>- The sap of the Spirit keeps spiritual life fresh. Instead of dryness, there is resilience; instead of fading, there is flourishing&#8212;evidence that being &#8220;planted in the house of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-13.htm">Psalm 92:13</a>) makes God&#8217;s people evergreen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a> assures the faithful that longevity in Christ is marked by ongoing usefulness and inner vitality. God carries His people into their gray-haired years, keeps them productive in Kingdom service, and sustains a freshness that defies outward decline. Aging, far from sidelining the believer, becomes another stage for God&#8217;s fruit-bearing, life-renewing power to shine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/92.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">They shall still bring forth.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Still shall they sprout in hoary age, sappy and green shall they be, </span>alluding to the great fruitfulness of the date palm, and to the fact that to the very last this fruitfulness continues.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/92.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">even</span> when they are old, they shall <span class="accented">still</span> bring forth fruit" - they shall still glorify God by their good works. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be fat and fiourishing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">fat and green.</span> The metaphor of ver. 12 is still kept up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/92-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In old age</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1497;&#1489;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#347;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
