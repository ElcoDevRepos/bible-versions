In the ancient Near East, slugs and snails were common and their trails of slime were a familiar sight. The imagery suggests a process of self-destruction, as the slug's own environment leads to its demise. This can be seen as a metaphor for the wicked, whose own actions lead to their downfall. The Bible often uses natural imagery to illustrate spiritual truths, as seen in <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>, where human life is compared to a moth-eaten garment. The self-destructive nature of sin is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing that the wicked will ultimately face the consequences of their actions.<p><b>like a woman&#8217;s stillborn child</b><br>This phrase introduces a somber and tragic image, reflecting the ultimate end of the wicked. In biblical times, the loss of a child was a profound tragedy, and stillbirths were not uncommon due to the lack of medical knowledge and care. This imagery underscores the abrupt and sorrowful end that awaits those who oppose God's righteousness. The comparison to a stillborn child highlights the futility and unfulfilled potential of the wicked, as they are cut off before they can experience life. This can be connected to <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>, where Job laments his own birth, wishing he had been a stillborn child to avoid suffering. The imagery serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of living in opposition to God's will.<p><b>may they never see the sun</b><br>The phrase "may they never see the sun" is a wish for the wicked to be cut off from life and its blessings. In biblical literature, seeing the sun is often associated with life, vitality, and the favor of God. <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a> states, "Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun," indicating the joy and goodness of life. The desire for the wicked to never see the sun is a call for their removal from the land of the living, a theme echoed in other imprecatory psalms where the psalmist seeks divine justice against evildoers. This reflects the belief in divine retribution, where the righteous seek God's intervention to uphold justice and righteousness. The imagery also points to the ultimate separation from God's presence, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>, where the unfaithful servant is cast into outer darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/58.htm">Psalm 58</a>, David is expressing a prayer for divine justice against the wicked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>The psalm addresses the corrupt and unjust leaders or judges, calling for their downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slug.htm">The Slug</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the slow and inevitable demise of the wicked.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/stillborn_child.htm">Stillborn Child</a></b><br>Another metaphor illustrating the futility and abrupt end of the wicked's plans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>The overarching theme of the psalm, emphasizing divine retribution against evil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_divine_justice.htm">The Inevitability of Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice may seem delayed, but it is certain and thorough.
