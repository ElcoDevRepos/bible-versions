Idolatry was prevalent in the ancient Near East, where nations worshiped gods represented by physical idols. The Hebrew word for "hate" here implies a deep aversion and rejection, aligning with God's commandment against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The term "worthless idols" underscores the futility and emptiness of worshiping anything other than the one true God. This sentiment is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, which mocks the absurdity of idol worship. The psalmist's stance is a call to purity and faithfulness to God, rejecting the cultural norms of surrounding nations.<p><b>but in the LORD I trust</b><br>This phrase contrasts the futility of idols with the reliability of the LORD, emphasizing a personal and covenantal relationship with God. Trust in the LORD is a central theme in the Psalms and throughout the Bible, highlighting faith as reliance on God's character and promises. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the covenant name of God, reminding the reader of His faithfulness and sovereignty. This trust is not just intellectual assent but involves a deep, personal reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. The psalmist's declaration is a model of faith, pointing to the ultimate trust exemplified by Jesus Christ, who perfectly trusted the Father even unto death (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing his trust in God amidst adversity.
