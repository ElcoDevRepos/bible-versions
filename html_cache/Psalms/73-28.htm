The act of drawing near to God is a central theme in the Psalms, emphasizing intimacy and reliance on divine presence. In the Old Testament, drawing near often involved temple worship, sacrifices, and prayer, highlighting the importance of the sanctuary as a place of communion with God. This phrase echoes <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you," underscoring the reciprocal relationship between God and the believer. The psalmist's declaration is a testament to the value of spiritual closeness over worldly success.<p><b>I have made the Lord GOD my refuge,</b><br>The term "refuge" is frequently used in the Psalms to describe God as a place of safety and protection. This imagery would resonate with ancient Israelites who sought physical refuge in fortified cities or natural strongholds. Spiritually, it signifies trust and dependence on God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The use of "Lord GOD" combines the divine names Yahweh and Elohim, emphasizing both the covenantal and powerful aspects of God's character. This phrase connects to other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, "God is our refuge and strength," reinforcing the theme of divine protection.<p><b>that I may proclaim all Your works.</b><br>The psalmist's intention to proclaim God's works indicates a response of gratitude and testimony. In the biblical context, proclaiming God's deeds was a way to bear witness to His faithfulness and power, often done in communal worship settings. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's acts of creation, deliverance, and provision are recounted and celebrated. The phrase suggests a missional aspect, where personal experience of God's refuge leads to public declaration, similar to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. It also reflects the prophetic role of Israel as a light to the nations, showcasing God's glory through their testimony.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.

This phrase marks his turning point.<p>&#8226;It&#8217;s a personal pivot: &#8220;Others may run after wealth or ease, but I choose a different path&#8221; (see <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226;It signals ownership of faith, not a borrowed conviction. Each believer has to reach this &#8220;but as for me&#8221; moment (<a href="/psalms/119-112.htm">Psalm 119:112</a>).<p>&#8226;It also testifies to the reality that righteousness is often counter-cultural; we stand apart from the majority (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is good to draw near to God</b><p>What Asaph now calls &#8220;good&#8221; contrasts with the fading pleasures he once coveted.<p>&#8226;&#8220;Good&#8221; is not merely pleasant; it is morally and spiritually beneficial (<a href="/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226;To &#8220;draw near&#8221; involves worship, prayer, and obedient living&#8212;like Moses entering the cloud (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>) or Mary sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>).<p>&#8226;The goodness found here is lasting: &#8220;Blessed is the one You choose and bring near&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>).
