Historically, Israel often faced challenges that tested their faith, such as captivity and exile. The call to hope in the LORD is a reminder of their covenant relationship with God, who delivered them from Egypt and promised them a future. This hope is not just wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's past faithfulness. Theologically, it points to the necessity of faith and trust in God&#8217;s promises, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate hope for all believers (<a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>).<p><b>for with the LORD is loving devotion</b><br>The term "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness. This covenantal love is central to God's relationship with Israel, as seen in His enduring patience and forgiveness despite their repeated disobedience. It reflects God's character as compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in love (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). This loving devotion is a key aspect of the divine nature, providing assurance to believers that God&#8217;s love is unwavering and eternal, a truth that is fully revealed in the sacrificial love of Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>and with Him is redemption in abundance</b><br>Redemption in this context refers to the act of being saved or delivered from sin and its consequences. In the Old Testament, redemption often involved the liberation of Israel from physical bondage, such as their deliverance from Egypt. The abundance of redemption signifies that God's power to save is limitless and available to all who seek Him. This foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who provides salvation from sin for all humanity (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The concept of abundant redemption emphasizes the sufficiency of Christ&#8217;s atoning sacrifice, ensuring that no sin is too great to be forgiven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, representing His covenant people.

Each believer&#8217;s confidence strengthens the whole body, just as Joshua&#8217;s faith once carried the people into the land (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, Gentile believers are grafted into this same faith family (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>), so the invitation to hope belongs to every one of us who trusts the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put your hope in the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Hope here is not wishful thinking; it is a settled, confident expectation rooted in God&#8217;s proven character (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The command is active: &#8220;put.&#8221; We consciously place our confidence in Him, turning from self-reliance, circumstances, or human alliances (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Such hope steadies us in waiting seasons. The same Psalm begins, &#8220;I wait for the LORD, my soul waits&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>). Our waiting is never empty; it is tethered to His promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for with the LORD is loving devotion</b><p>&#8226; The reason for hope is God&#8217;s own nature: &#8220;loving devotion.&#8221; He is &#8220;abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His love is loyal, enduring, and active&#8212;it moves toward us even when we falter (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>; <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because His devotion is intrinsic to who He is, it cannot be exhausted. We stand on unshakable ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with Him is redemption in abundance</b><p>&#8226; Redemption means rescue at a price. For Israel, God redeemed them from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). For us, He &#8220;gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;abundance&#8221; sweeps away any fear that our sin or need might outstrip His supply. &#8220;Where sin increased, grace increased all the more&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This redemption is both present and future: forgiveness now (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>) and the final restoration of all things when Christ returns (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist points to a Redeemer who pays in overflow; the New Testament reveals Him as Jesus, whose blood &#8220;speaks a better word&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>) and secures eternal deliverance (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/130-7.htm">Psalm 130:7</a> invites God&#8217;s people to place confident hope in Him because His character overflows with steadfast love and limitless redemption. The verse moves from a corporate summons (&#8220;O Israel&#8221;) to a personal charge (&#8220;put your hope&#8221;), anchoring that charge in two unbreakable realities: the Lord&#8217;s loyal love and His abundant rescue. No burden, bondage, or backlog of sin can outmatch the Redeemer&#8217;s capacity to save.
