The concept of being "decreased" and "humbled" can be seen throughout Israel's history, such as during the Babylonian exile when the population was significantly reduced and the people were brought low. This humbling often serves as a means for God to draw His people back to Himself, emphasizing the need for reliance on Him rather than on their own strength or numbers. The humbling process is a common biblical motif, seen in the lives of figures like Joseph, who was humbled through slavery and imprisonment before being exalted in Egypt.<p><b>by oppression, evil, and sorrow</b><br>Oppression, evil, and sorrow are often instruments through which God allows His people to be tested and refined. In the context of ancient Israel, oppression frequently came from foreign nations, such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, who subjugated the Israelites. Evil can refer to both moral wickedness and the resulting consequences of sin, which lead to sorrow. This triad of oppression, evil, and sorrow is reminiscent of the trials faced by Job, who endured immense suffering yet remained faithful. The New Testament also speaks to the reality of suffering in the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>, where Paul describes being "hard pressed on every side, but not crushed." These experiences are not without purpose; they often lead to spiritual growth and a deeper understanding of God's sovereignty and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Psalms, often experiencing cycles of prosperity and adversity, reflecting their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppressors.htm">Oppressors</a></b><br>Those who bring about oppression, evil, and sorrow, often seen as instruments of God's discipline or as enemies of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who reflects on the experiences of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A recurring place in the Psalms symbolizing trials and testing, often where the Israelites faced oppression and learned dependence on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>An event or series of events where God intervenes to rescue His people from their distress, a central theme in <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_discipline.htm">Understanding God's Discipline</a></b><br>God allows His people to experience decrease and humility as a form of discipline, teaching them reliance on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_oppression.htm">Responding to Oppression</a></b><br>Believers are called to trust in God's justice and deliverance when facing oppression and evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_sorrow_in_spiritual_growth.htm">The Role of Sorrow in Spiritual Growth</a></b><br>Sorrow can lead to deeper spiritual maturity and dependence on God, refining our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_as_a_path_to_restoration.htm">Humility as a Path to Restoration</a></b><br>Humility before God is often the precursor to His restoration and blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>Recognizing God's sovereignty helps believers find peace and purpose in the midst of trials.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_107_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 107:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_39_God_s_rule_in_hardship.htm">How does Psalm 107:39 illustrate God's sovereignty in times of oppression and hardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_the_humbled_in_Psalm_107_39.htm">What lessons can we learn from the "diminished and humbled" in Psalm 107:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_39_Deut_8_2-3_God_s_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 107:39 connect with God's faithfulness in Deuteronomy 8:2-3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_trust_God_in_trials_Psalm_107_39.htm">In what ways can we trust God during personal trials, as seen in Psalm 107:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_aid_those_in_crisis_today.htm">How can we support others experiencing "oppression, calamity, and sorrow" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_39_God_s_role_in_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 107:39 reflect God's role in human suffering and restoration?

Scripture often links this kind of decrease to wandering from God&#8217;s ways. In <a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a> the Israelites were &#8220;greatly impoverished&#8221; by Midian until they cried out to the LORD. <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> has traced the same pattern: blessing, drifting, discipline, and then deliverance when hearts turn back. In His covenant faithfulness, God sometimes withdraws prosperity so His people will recognize their need and return (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and humbled</b><p>Decrease alone might breed resentment, but God&#8217;s aim is humility. He allows circumstances that press pride out of us, the way He &#8220;humbled&#8221; Israel in the wilderness to &#8220;know what was in your heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). <a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a> reminds us, &#8220;A man&#8217;s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit obtains honor.&#8221; Humbled hearts are soft soil for grace; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> reiterates that the Lord &#8220;gives grace to the humble.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by oppression</b><p>The instrument God sometimes uses is human oppression. Whether under Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>), Babylon (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>), or local enemies in Judges, His people have felt the heavy hand of others. Oppression is never excused, but God sovereignly bends it to discipline and ultimately rescue. As in <a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>, He responds with deliverers when His people, crushed by oppressors, cry out to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>evil</b><p>Oppression often springs from outright wickedness&#8212;evil systems, evil leaders, even the people&#8217;s own evil choices. <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> warns against calling evil good; <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a> shows how God &#8220;gave them over&#8221; when they persisted in it. <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>&#8217;s cycle demonstrates that evil is self-destructive; God&#8217;s people cannot dabble in it without experiencing loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sorrow</b><p>Inevitable sorrow follows: emotional, relational, national. <a href="/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a> laments, &#8220;My strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away.&#8221; Yet sorrow is also the birthplace of repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). In <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> the tears of sorrow become the very cries God answers, turning deserts into streams (v. 35) and lifting the needy &#8220;out of their affliction&#8221; (v. 41).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39</a> captures one link in the psalm&#8217;s repeating chain: God&#8217;s people drift, God reduces and humbles them through oppression, evil, and sorrow, and then&#8212;when they acknowledge their need&#8212;He rescues. The verse warns against complacency, explains hardship as purposeful discipline, and assures that humility before God is the doorstep to renewal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/107.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again</span>. There is no "again" in the original, but merely the usual yaw conjunctive. Still, in the <span class="accented">thought</span>, there is no doubt an abrupt transition. The writer turns to the darker side of the picture. <span class="cmt_word">They are minished and brought low</span>. God shows his providence, not merely in blessing, but also in chastising. Even the very nation which has been the most highly favored may, by misconduct, fall under his displeasure and suffer at his hands. Their population is diminished; they arc "bowed down" (Revised Version), or "brought low." Calamities of various kinds befall them. Sometimes their decline is brought about <span class="cmt_word">through oppression</span>, which may be either the cruel rule of a native monarch, such as Saul, or the still heavier yoke of a foreign power, like Egypt or Babylon. Sometimes it comes from such an <span class="cmt_word">affliction</span> as bad harvests, plagues of locusts, or pestilence. Sometimes it is brought about by <span class="cmt_word">sorrow</span> - the death of a good ruler in the flower of his age, the extinction of a royal stock, the destruction of a nation's best and bravest on battle-fields, and the like. But in all calamities alike it is God's hand that deals the blow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/107-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they are decreased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1496;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4591.htm">Strong's 4591: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pare off, lessen, in, to be, small, few</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and humbled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1425;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7817.htm">Strong's 7817: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bow, be bowed down, crouch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by oppression,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1465;&#1430;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7779;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6115.htm">Strong's 6115: </a> </span><span class="str2">Closure, constraint</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evil,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and sorrow,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3015.htm">Strong's 3015: </a> </span><span class="str2">Grief, sorrow</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/107-39.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 107:39 Again they are diminished and bowed down (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/107-38.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 107:38"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 107:38" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/107-40.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 107:40"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 107:40" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
