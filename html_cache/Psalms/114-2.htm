The term "sanctuary" signifies a holy place where God's presence dwells. Historically, the temple in Jerusalem, located in Judah, was the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to dwell with His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>. The choice of Judah as the sanctuary also points to the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where the scepter is promised to Judah, indicating leadership and divine favor.<p><b>Israel His dominion</b><br>This phrase refers to the entire nation of Israel being under God's rule and authority. The term "dominion" suggests sovereignty and control, emphasizing that Israel was chosen to be a theocracy, governed directly by God. This is evident in the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God gave the Law to Moses, setting Israel apart as His people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The historical context includes Israel's journey from slavery in Egypt to becoming a nation under God's guidance. This dominion is a type of the ultimate reign of Christ, who is the King of Kings and will establish His eternal kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, Judah is significant as the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended.
