The ascent is both physical, as Jerusalem is situated on a hill, and spiritual, symbolizing drawing closer to God. The Songs of Ascents emphasize themes of trust, deliverance, and worship.<p><b>Of David.</b><br>This attribution suggests that King David is the author of this psalm. David's life was marked by numerous instances where he experienced God's deliverance, making him a fitting author for a psalm of thanksgiving for divine intervention. David's reign was characterized by military victories and the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel, aligning with the themes of protection and divine favor.<p><b>If the LORD had not been on our side&#8212;</b><br>This phrase introduces a conditional statement that invites reflection on God's past interventions. The LORD, represented by the tetragrammaton YHWH, is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His faithfulness and commitment to Israel. The phrase suggests a hypothetical scenario where God's presence and support were absent, highlighting the nation's dependence on divine aid. This echoes other biblical narratives where God's presence was crucial, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>) and battles during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>).<p><b>let Israel now declare&#8212;</b><br>This call to the nation of Israel to affirm God's intervention serves as a communal testimony of faith. It encourages collective remembrance and acknowledgment of God's past deeds, fostering unity and reinforcing national identity. The act of declaring is a form of worship and witness, similar to the call in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a> for Israel to remember and teach God's commandments.
