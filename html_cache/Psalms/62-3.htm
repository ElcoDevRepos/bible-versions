The psalmist, traditionally attributed to David, is expressing frustration over continuous threats and oppression. In the historical context, David often faced threats from enemies, including King Saul and later his own son Absalom. This question implies a sense of endurance and the expectation that God will eventually intervene. Biblically, this echoes the cries of other figures who faced persecution, such as Job and Jeremiah, who also questioned the duration of their suffering. It highlights the human experience of waiting on God's timing for deliverance.<p><b>Will all of you throw him down</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a collective effort against an individual, indicating that the psalmist feels surrounded by adversaries. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal actions were significant, and conspiracies against a leader were not uncommon. This imagery can be connected to the betrayal and conspiracy against Jesus Christ, where religious leaders and the crowd sought to bring Him down. Theologically, it underscores the theme of the righteous being opposed by the wicked, a recurring motif throughout the Psalms and the broader biblical narrative.<p><b>like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?</b><br>The simile of a leaning wall or tottering fence conveys vulnerability and imminent collapse. In ancient architecture, walls and fences were crucial for protection, and their instability would symbolize weakness and danger. This imagery suggests that the psalmist's enemies perceive him as weak and easy to overthrow. However, it also implies that their efforts are ultimately futile, as God is the true protector. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite appearing vulnerable during His earthly ministry, was upheld by God and ultimately victorious over His adversaries. The metaphor serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human strength compared to divine support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>, David is expressing his trust in God amidst adversity and threats from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries who are threatening David, symbolizing those who oppose the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaning_wall_/_tottering_fence.htm">Leaning Wall / Tottering Fence</a></b><br>Metaphors used to describe the vulnerability and instability of a person under attack or pressure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_strength.htm">Trust in God's Strength</a></b><br>Just as David faced threats, believers today can find strength and stability in God, who is our fortress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_vulnerability.htm">Recognizing Vulnerability</a></b><br>The imagery of a leaning wall reminds us of our own vulnerabilities and the need to rely on God's strength rather than our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Despite the threats and instability, maintaining faith in God is crucial.

Verse 4 develops this, noting they &#8220;take delight in lies; they bless with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse.&#8221; Similar schemes appear in <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>, &#8220;They conspire against me and plot to take my life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This reminds us that opposition can feel overwhelming, yet the Lord remains the believer&#8217;s defense (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus experienced the ultimate conspiracy (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55</a>), fulfilling <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>&#8217;s theme and proving God brings victory out of plotting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?</b><p>&#8226; The enemies judge David to be already unstable, as if one push will finish him. <a href="/isaiah/30-13.htm">Isaiah 30:13</a> compares sin&#8217;s consequences to &#8220;a bulge in a high wall, whose collapse comes suddenly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; From the outside David may look fragile&#8212;running, hiding, weary&#8212;but his real foundation is the Rock of his salvation (<a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>). <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a> speaks of man as &#8220;a decaying thing,&#8221; yet the Lord delights to uphold the weak (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The image also warns us not to trust appearances. God often allows vulnerability so His strength is unmistakable (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, when others consider us &#8220;leaning walls,&#8221; we stand firm by anchoring to the unshakable word of God (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a> captures the believer&#8217;s experience of persistent, united hostility. David&#8217;s foes see him as easy prey&#8212;a wall ready to collapse&#8212;yet their assessment ignores the unseen support of the Lord. The verse calls us to acknowledge real threats, lament their duration, and remember that human weakness under God&#8217;s protection is stronger than any crowd bent on destruction.
