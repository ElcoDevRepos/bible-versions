The term "unformed body" refers to the embryonic stage, highlighting God's awareness and care even before physical form is fully developed. This reflects the biblical view of life beginning at conception, aligning with passages like <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God knows Jeremiah before he is formed in the womb. The imagery of God's "eyes" suggests a personal and attentive observation, indicating that every life is precious and known to God from the very start.<p><b>all my days were written in Your book</b><br>The concept of a divine "book" where one's days are recorded suggests God's sovereign plan and foreknowledge. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's control over history and individual lives, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where books are symbolic of God's record-keeping. The idea that our days are "written" implies a predetermined plan, underscoring the belief in God's providence and the assurance that nothing in life is random or outside His will.<p><b>and ordained for me</b><br>The term "ordained" indicates that God has set apart and established each day with purpose. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's active role in guiding and directing the course of human life. It suggests that every event and circumstance is part of a divine plan, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are created for good works prepared in advance by God. This assurance of divine ordination provides comfort and purpose, knowing that life is not left to chance.<p><b>before one of them came to be.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal nature and His ability to see beyond the constraints of time. It emphasizes that God's knowledge and plans precede human existence, reinforcing His omnipotence and omniscience. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, and with the concept of God's eternal purpose in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>.
