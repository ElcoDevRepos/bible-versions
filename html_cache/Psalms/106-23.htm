The context is the wilderness period after the Exodus from Egypt, where the Israelites frequently disobeyed God. This reflects God's holiness and justice, as He cannot tolerate sin. The concept of divine judgment is consistent throughout Scripture, seen in events like the flood (Genesis 6-9) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach&#8212;</b><br>Moses is described as "His chosen one," highlighting his unique role as mediator between God and Israel. The phrase "stood before Him in the breach" is a metaphor for intercession, where Moses acts as a barrier to prevent God's wrath. This imagery is similar to a soldier standing in a gap in a wall to protect a city. Moses' intercession is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). This act of standing in the breach is also a demonstration of Moses' leadership and love for his people, as he pleads for their forgiveness (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>).<p><b>to divert His wrath from destroying them.</b><br>The concept of divine wrath is a consistent theme in the Bible, representing God's righteous anger against sin. Moses' intercession successfully diverts this wrath, showcasing the power of prayer and the importance of a mediator. This act of mercy foreshadows the work of Jesus Christ, who diverts God's wrath from believers through His sacrificial death (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>). The idea of divine mercy is also seen in other instances, such as Abraham's intercession for Sodom (Genesis 18) and the sparing of Nineveh after Jonah's warning (Jonah 3).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign and just deity who is angered by the Israelites' disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and intercessor for the Israelites, who stands in the gap to plead for God's mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people who repeatedly fall into sin and idolatry, provoking God's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breach.htm">The Breach</a></b><br>A metaphorical gap representing the separation between God and His people due to their sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf_incident.htm">The Golden Calf Incident</a></b><br>The specific event referenced here, where the Israelites worshiped a golden calf at Mount Sinai, leading to God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>Moses' intercession demonstrates the profound impact one person's prayer can have in averting God's judgment.
