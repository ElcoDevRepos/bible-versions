The term "redeemed" refers to those whom God has rescued or bought back, often from slavery or captivity. In the Old Testament, redemption is a key theme, particularly in the context of the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). The act of saying or proclaiming God's redemption is an act of worship and testimony, encouraging others to recognize God's power and faithfulness. This aligns with the biblical principle of bearing witness to God's works (<a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>).<p><b>whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy</b><br>This phrase highlights God's intervention in rescuing His people from adversaries. Historically, this could refer to various instances where Israel was delivered from physical enemies, such as during the Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/31-11.htm">Jeremiah 31:11</a>). The "hand of the enemy" symbolizes oppression and danger, from which God provides salvation. This redemption is a type of Christ's ultimate redemption of humanity from sin and death (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>). The imagery of God's hand is significant, often representing His power and authority (<a href="/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_redeemed.htm">The Redeemed</a></b><br>Refers to those whom God has delivered or saved, particularly from peril or bondage.
