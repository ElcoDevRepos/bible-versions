The reference to these leaders in <a href="/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a> serves as a reminder of God's past victories over Israel's enemies. The Midianites were nomadic people who often raided Israel, and their defeat was a significant event in Israel's history.

The record of Gideon&#8217;s victory reassures us that God still rules over political and military powers (<a href="/psalms/47-8.htm">Psalm 47:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a>b)<p>&#8226; Zebah and Zalmunna were Midianite kings captured and executed by Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10-21</a>).

God&#8217;s judgment reveals His supremacy and invites even His enemies to acknowledge Him (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: Believers can pray boldly for God to deal decisively with entrenched evil, trusting that He alone has the wisdom to judge righteously (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a> reaches back to Gideon&#8217;s triumph over Midian to frame Asaph&#8217;s prayer for present deliverance.
