The concept of God's eternal rule is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting His unchanging nature and supreme authority over all creation. In the context of ancient Israel, this would have been a comforting reminder of God's control amidst the rise and fall of earthly kingdoms. The power of God is often demonstrated through His creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>) and His mighty acts in history, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). This eternal rule is also a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ, as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises, will reign forever (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p><b>His eyes watch the nations.</b><br>This phrase suggests God's omniscience and His active involvement in the affairs of the world. The imagery of God's eyes watching implies His awareness and judgment over the nations. In biblical times, nations often represented powers that opposed God's people, and this assurance of divine oversight would have been significant for Israel. The idea of God watching is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, which states that the eyes of the Lord are everywhere. This also connects to the prophetic vision of God's ultimate judgment and justice over all nations, as seen in the book of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>).<p><b>Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.</b><br>This phrase is a call for divine justice against those who oppose God's authority. The rebellious are those who defy God's laws and seek to elevate themselves above His will. In the historical context, this could refer to nations or individuals who threaten the peace and security of God's people. The plea for God to prevent the exaltation of the rebellious aligns with the biblical principle that pride leads to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This also points to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where all rebellion will be subdued, and Christ will be exalted above all (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. It serves as a moment to meditate on the truths expressed, particularly the sovereignty and justice of God as described in this verse. This pause encourages deeper contemplation of God's eternal power, His vigilant oversight, and the assurance that He will not allow rebellion to prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the eternal ruler who exercises sovereign power over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Represents all the peoples and countries of the world, under God's watchful eye.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellious.htm">The Rebellious</a></b><br>Those who oppose or defy God's authority, warned not to exalt themselves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_sovereignty.htm">God's Eternal Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's rule is not temporary or limited; He reigns forever with unmatched power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_surveillance.htm">Divine Surveillance</a></b><br>Understand that God is always watching over the nations, aware of all actions and intentions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warning_against_rebellion.htm">Warning Against Rebellion</a></b><br>Reflect on the futility and danger of exalting oneself against God, as rebellion leads to downfall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Trust that God, in His sovereignty, will ultimately bring justice and righteousness to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/selah--pause_and_reflect.htm">Selah: Pause and Reflect</a></b><br>Take time to pause and meditate on God's power and authority, allowing it to influence your life and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_66_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 66:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_66_7_God_s_eternal_rule_focus.htm">How does Psalm 66:7 emphasize God's eternal rule over nations and individuals?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_His_eyes_show_God_s_omnipresence.htm">What does "His eyes watch the nations" teach about God's omnipresence?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_66_7_daily.htm">How can we apply God's sovereignty in Psalm 66:7 to our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_66_7_and_Romans_13_1_link.htm">How does Psalm 66:7 connect with Romans 13:1 on God's authority over rulers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_should_believers_react_to_God_s_rule.htm">In what ways should believers respond to God's sovereignty as described in Psalm 66:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_66_7_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does Psalm 66:7 affirm God's sovereignty over nations and rulers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Psalm_66_7.htm">What historical context supports the message of Psalm 66:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_66_7_vs_modern_political_power.htm">How does Psalm 66:7 challenge modern views on political power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_66.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_god's_foes_defy_him_without_fear.htm">In light of Psalm 66:3, how can God's enemies supposedly 'cringe before him' when many openly oppose or dismiss God without apparent consequence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_no_record_of_god's_footstool.htm">Psalm 99:5 calls for worship at God's footstool; if this footstool is literal, why is there no archaeological record or clear location for it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_2_7_contradict_jesus'_sonship.htm">Does Psalm 2:7 contradict the exclusive claim of Jesus' divine sonship by calling the king 'begotten' as well?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_11_4_fit_with_space_travel.htm">If Psalm 11:4 says God's throne is in heaven, how does this align with modern understanding of the cosmos and space travel?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 66:7 Mean</div><b>He rules forever by His power</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist anchors our confidence in God&#8217;s unending reign.
