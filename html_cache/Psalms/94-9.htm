The rhetorical question suggests that the Creator, who designed the human ear, is fully capable of hearing. In biblical context, this is a reminder of God's awareness of human actions and prayers. The ear, as a symbol of hearing, is often used in Scripture to denote understanding and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12</a>). Theologically, this underscores God's intimate involvement with His creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates with purpose and precision. The idea that God hears is a recurring theme, assuring believers of His attentiveness (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p><b>He who formed the eye, can He not see?</b><br>This phrase highlights God's ability to see all things, reinforcing His omnipresence and omniscience. The eye, a complex organ, signifies perception and insight. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, seeing was associated with knowledge and judgment. This rhetorical question challenges any notion that God is unaware of human affairs. Biblically, God's sight is often linked to His justice and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). The formation of the eye also points to God's intricate design in creation, as described in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>. This assurance of God's watchful presence is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus, as the embodiment of God, sees and knows the hearts of men (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/94.htm">Psalm 94</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another inspired writer, who is addressing the justice and omniscience of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is being described as the one who formed the ear and the eye, emphasizing His ability to hear and see all things.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressors.htm">The Oppressors</a></b><br>Implied in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/94.htm">Psalm 94</a>, these are the wicked who act unjustly, thinking they can escape God's notice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are suffering under oppression and are seeking God's justice and deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often addressed in the Psalms, representing God's chosen people who are in need of His protection and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God is fully aware of all that happens in the world.
