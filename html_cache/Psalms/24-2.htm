In the ancient Near Eastern context, the sea often symbolized chaos and disorder. By stating that God founded the earth upon the seas, the psalmist highlights God's authority over chaos, bringing order and stability. This echoes the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>, where God gathers the waters to reveal dry land. The imagery of God founding the earth upon the seas also reflects the belief that God is the ultimate architect of the world, establishing it on a firm foundation despite the tumultuous nature of the seas. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who calms the storms and brings peace, as depicted in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>and established it upon the waters.</b><br>The repetition of the theme of waters reinforces the idea of God's control over the natural world. In biblical literature, water often represents both life and destruction, as seen in the flood narrative (Genesis 7). By establishing the earth upon the waters, God demonstrates His ability to sustain and uphold creation. This phrase also connects to the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>, where God's wisdom is portrayed as setting boundaries for the sea. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work, where He establishes a new creation through His death and resurrection, bringing order and life out of chaos and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (He)</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of the earth, who has the power and authority to establish the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The physical world that God has created and established.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seas_and_waters.htm">The Seas and Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of chaos and disorder in ancient Near Eastern thought, yet under God's control and order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, including the chaotic elements symbolized by the seas.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/order_from_chaos.htm">Order from Chaos</a></b><br>Understand that God brings order out of chaos, both in the natural world and in our personal lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_control.htm">Trust in God's Control</a></b><br>Trust that God has established the world with purpose and precision, and He is in control of all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation_reflects_god's_power.htm">Creation Reflects God's Power</a></b><br>Reflect on how the natural world reveals God's power and majesty, leading us to worship Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foundation_of_faith.htm">Foundation of Faith</a></b><br>Build your faith on the firm foundation of God's unchanging nature and His promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_24_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 24:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_24_2_God_s_rule_over_creation.htm">How does Psalm 24:2 affirm God's sovereignty over creation and the earth's foundation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_upon_seas_show_about_God.htm">What does "founded it upon the seas" reveal about God's creative power?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Genesis_1_9-10_to_Psalm_24_2.htm">How does Genesis 1:9-10 connect with Psalm 24:2's depiction of creation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_24_2_boost_your_faith.htm">How can acknowledging God's creation in Psalm 24:2 strengthen your daily faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_24_2_inspire_stewardship.htm">In what ways can Psalm 24:2 inspire stewardship of God's creation today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_24_2_vs_Earth_s_formation_science.htm">How does Psalm 24:2 align with scientific understanding of Earth's formation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_founded_it_upon_the_seas.htm">What does "founded it upon the seas" mean in Psalm 24:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_24_2_and_ancient_cosmology_link.htm">How does Psalm 24:2 reflect ancient Near Eastern cosmology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_earth_'founded_on_seas'.htm">(Psalm 24:2) How can the earth be literally &#8220;founded on the seas&#8221; when modern science shows it is not supported by water? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_inherited_sin_justifiable.htm">How can the concept of inherited sin be considered just?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_job_37_14-15_conflict_with_free_will.htm">Does Job 37:14-15's portrayal of God controlling weather conflict with biblical passages that emphasize human free will over divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_are_we_captives_in_your_parade.htm">What are spiritual beings?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 24:2 Mean</div><b>For</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;for&#8221; ties verse 2 back to verse 1, giving the reason God rightfully owns &#8220;the earth and all its fullness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links ownership to creative authority&#8212;<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>: &#8220;Know that the LORD is God.
