In the context of <a href="/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a>, it reflects a moment of realization or commitment. The speaker, traditionally understood as David, is responding to God's call or purpose. This phrase can be seen as a moment of personal dedication, aligning with the biblical theme of responding to God's will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>, where Isaiah responds to God's call with "Here am I. Send me!"<p><b>&#8220;Here I am,</b><br>This expression signifies readiness and willingness to serve or fulfill a purpose. It echoes the responses of biblical figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>), who also said "Here I am" when called by God. It denotes availability and submission to God's will, a theme central to the life of believers who are called to be ready to serve God at any moment.<p><b>I have come&#8212;</b><br>This phrase suggests arrival or presence, indicating that the speaker is stepping into a role or mission. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's incarnation, where Jesus came into the world to fulfill God's redemptive plan. In the New Testament, Jesus often speaks of His coming as fulfilling the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p><b>it is written about me</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the concept of prophecy and fulfillment. It suggests that the speaker's actions or role were foretold in Scripture. This is particularly significant in the context of messianic prophecy, where the life and mission of Jesus Christ were written about in the Old Testament. <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a> directly quotes this verse, applying it to Christ, emphasizing that His coming was in accordance with God's predetermined plan as revealed in the Scriptures.<p><b>in the scroll:</b><br>The scroll refers to the written Word of God, the Scriptures. In ancient times, scrolls were the primary medium for recording texts, including the Law and the Prophets. This phrase underscores the authority and reliability of Scripture as the record of God's plans and purposes. It also points to the continuity of God's revelation, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, where the scrolls of the Law and the Prophets find their fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a>, David is expressing a prophetic utterance that points beyond himself.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/messiah.htm">Messiah</a></b><br>This verse is often seen as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the Scriptures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scroll.htm">Scroll</a></b><br>Refers to the Scriptures or the Law, indicating that the coming of the Messiah was foretold in the sacred texts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Recognize that the Old Testament contains prophecies that are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_obedience.htm">Christ's Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies perfect obedience to God's will, as foretold in the Scriptures.

In <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, sacrifices alone were shown to be insufficient; now the psalmist speaks up.<p>- Scripture often shows that genuine obedience begins with a verbal acknowledgment of God&#8217;s will (see <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>, &#8220;Then I heard the voice of the Lord &#8230; and I said, &#8216;Here am I. Send me!&#8217;&#8221;).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-7</a> cites this very line, confirming that it ultimately speaks of Christ, who responds to the Father&#8217;s redemptive plan with willing words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>here I am</b><p>- These three simple words convey availability and surrender. Like Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>, the speaker stands ready for whatever God asks.<p>- The phrase signals readiness to move from mere profession to active service, echoing <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> where believers are urged to &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>i have come</b><p>- The speaker doesn&#8217;t just offer willingness; he steps forward in action.<p>- In the immediate context David testifies that he will obey God&#8217;s revealed will; prophetically the line is fulfilled in Jesus, whose incarnation is the ultimate &#8220;coming&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, &#8220;For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me&#8221;).<p>- This movement from intention to embodiment reminds us that faith is verified by deeds (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is written about me</b><p>- The psalmist recognizes that his life is aligned with God&#8217;s already-recorded plan. His obedience isn&#8217;t improvisation; it flows from Scripture&#8217;s storyline.<p>- Christ applies this directly to Himself in <a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, explaining &#8220;Moses and all the Prophets&#8221; as writings &#8220;about Him.&#8221;<p>- Knowing that God&#8217;s Word speaks about us&#8212;our need, our calling, our destiny&#8212;adds gravity to every choice we make.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the scroll</b><p>- Ancient covenant documents were kept in scrolls; thus &#8220;the scroll&#8221; points to the authoritative record of God&#8217;s covenant purposes.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a> shows God instructing, &#8220;Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken,&#8221; underscoring Scripture&#8217;s role as the settled, binding revelation.<p>- By appealing to the scroll, the speaker roots his mission in unchanging revelation rather than shifting human opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> pictures a servant who listens to God&#8217;s Word, answers willingly, steps forward obediently, and understands that his life fulfills the written purposes of God. In its immediate sense David pledges wholehearted obedience; in its prophetic fullness it finds perfect realization in Jesus Christ, whose coming was scripted in the scroll of Scripture and who models the wholehearted response every believer is invited to make.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Then said I.</span>--This rendering, which follows the LXX. and Vulg., and is adopted in the Epistle to the Hebrews, must be abandoned.

The psalmist represents himself as brining with him "the roll of the book," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the book of the Law in its ordinary form of a parchment roll, to show what it is that he is prepared to obey.
