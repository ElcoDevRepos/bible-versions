In biblical context, wealth is often seen as a temporary and potentially deceptive measure of success (<a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a>). The psalmist encourages trust in God rather than in material wealth, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven. Historically, wealth in ancient Israel was often associated with God's blessing, yet the wisdom literature, including Psalms and Proverbs, frequently warns against placing trust in riches (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). This phrase reassures believers that God's justice and provision are not dependent on earthly wealth.<p><b>when the splendor of his house increases</b><br>The "splendor of his house" refers to the visible signs of prosperity, such as luxurious homes and possessions. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a grand house was a status symbol, reflecting one's social and economic standing. The psalmist reminds the audience that such splendor is fleeting and not a true measure of one's worth or security. This is consistent with the teachings found in Ecclesiastes, where the Preacher notes the vanity of earthly achievements (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-11</a>). The phrase also subtly points to the transient nature of life and material possessions, as seen in the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where Jesus warns against the folly of hoarding wealth without being "rich toward God."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/49.htm">Psalm 49</a>, traditionally attributed to the sons of Korah, who were Levites and temple musicians.
