This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>. The striking of the rock by Moses, under God's command, symbolizes God's provision and faithfulness despite the people's lack of faith. Geographically, this took place in the desert regions of Sinai, where water was scarce, highlighting the miracle's significance. Theologically, the rock is often seen as a type of Christ, as Paul notes in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where Christ is the spiritual rock that provides living water. The torrents raging emphasize the abundance and power of God's provision, contrasting with the people's doubt.<p><b>But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase captures the Israelites' skepticism and lack of faith in God's ability to provide for their needs beyond water. Historically, this reflects the Israelites' repeated grumbling and testing of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a> and <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>, where they longed for the food they had in Egypt. The question posed here is rhetorical, highlighting their doubt despite witnessing God's previous miracles. Biblically, this foreshadows God's provision of manna and quail, as described in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>, demonstrating His continued care and provision. Prophetically, the provision of bread can be seen as a type of the true bread from heaven, Jesus Christ, as He declares in <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>.

Bread here points to manna, which God had already provided daily (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Doubt often ignores yesterday&#8217;s mercies.
