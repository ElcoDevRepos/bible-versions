Despite God's provision of manna, the people longed for the foods of Egypt, demonstrating a lack of trust and contentment in God's provision. This desire symbolizes human nature's tendency to seek satisfaction in worldly things rather than in God. Theologically, it highlights the concept of idolatry, where desires become more important than obedience to God. This moment foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>, where Paul warns against those whose "god is their stomach."<p><b>with the food still in their mouths</b><br>This phrase indicates the immediacy of God's response to the Israelites' rebellion. In <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>, it is recorded that while the meat was still between their teeth, God's anger was kindled, and He struck them with a severe plague. This serves as a warning about the consequences of disobedience and ingratitude. Theologically, it underscores the justice of God and His intolerance for sin. It also serves as a type of Christ, who later teaches in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a> that He is the "bread of life," contrasting the temporary satisfaction of physical food with the eternal fulfillment found in Him. This moment in Israel's history is a reminder of the importance of spiritual nourishment over physical desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.

The psalmist pauses the story of Israel&#8217;s wilderness wanderings to underline how quickly the next event happens&#8212;&#8220;Yet before&#8221; anything else can take place (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-29.htm">Psalm 78:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This time stamp ties directly to <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31&#8211;33</a>, where quail piled up around the camp &#8220;about a day&#8217;s journey on each side.&#8221; The time between God&#8217;s provision and His judgment is measured in moments, not days.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds readers that God responds swiftly when His holiness is challenged (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they had filled their desire</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Desire&#8221; points to the craving that had begun earlier: &#8220;They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a> describes the &#8220;rabble&#8221; that stirred up the complaint; lust for more than God&#8217;s daily manna drove the camp.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> cites this very episode: &#8220;Now these things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.&#8221; The apostle confirms that unchecked desire leads directly to discipline.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-14.htm">Psalm 106:14&#8211;15</a> records the outcome: &#8220;They craved intensely in the wilderness&#8230; so He gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.&#8221; God sometimes grants what people insist on, letting the consequences expose the sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the food still in their mouths</b><p>&#8226; Judgment falls mid&#8211;bite: &#8220;While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the Lord burned against the people&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The image is graphic: mouths packed, hearts still unrepentant. It underscores that physical satisfaction provides no shield from divine wrath (<a href="/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s action demonstrates His intolerance for idolatrous appetites. Even the blessing He supplied becomes the instrument of correction when hearts remain rebellious (<a href="/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30</a> shows the razor-thin line between God&#8217;s gracious provision and His righteous discipline. Before Israel could swallow the quail they&#8217;d demanded, the Lord&#8217;s judgment descended. Their craving&#8212;unchecked and ungrateful&#8212;revealed hearts more focused on food than on the Giver. The verse warns every generation: desires that outrun trust invite swift correction, even in the very moment we think we are being satisfied.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30, 31) Evidently from <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm" title="And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.">Numbers 11:33</a>, <span class= "ital">They did not yet loath in consequence of their lusts, the meat was yet in their mouths when, </span>&c.
