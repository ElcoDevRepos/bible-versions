The glory of the LORD refers to His majesty, power, and divine presence. In the Old Testament, God's glory is often associated with His presence in the tabernacle and the temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The enduring nature of God's glory is a reminder of His unchanging character and eternal sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, which states that the word of God stands forever. This phrase also reflects the creation narrative, where God's glory is revealed through His works (Genesis 1). Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's glory in the new creation, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>, where the glory of God illuminates the New Jerusalem.<p><b>may the LORD rejoice in His works.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's delight in His creation. The concept of God rejoicing in His works is rooted in the creation account, where God saw everything He had made and declared it "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). This joy reflects the relationship between the Creator and His creation, emphasizing that God's works are not only functional but also bring Him pleasure. Theologically, this can be connected to the idea that creation reveals God's attributes, as stated in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>. The rejoicing of the LORD in His works also foreshadows the restoration of creation, where God will once again take delight in a renewed world, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>. This phrase can be seen as a call for believers to also find joy in God's creation and to steward it responsibly, reflecting God's own delight and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the eternal and sovereign God of Israel, whose glory and works are the focus of the psalmist's praise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works_of_the_lord.htm">The Works of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the entirety of creation and the ongoing acts of God in the world, which are a testament to His power and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_enduring_glory_of_god.htm">The Enduring Glory of God</a></b><br>God's glory is not temporary or fleeting; it is eternal.
