It highlights God's role as a shepherd, leading His people through the wilderness. The imagery of God as a shepherd is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a>, where God leads His people beside still waters and through the valley of the shadow of death. The safety provided by God is not merely physical but also spiritual, as He guides them towards the Promised Land, a type of the ultimate salvation and rest found in Christ.<p><b>so they did not fear</b><br>The absence of fear among the Israelites is significant, considering their previous experiences of oppression in Egypt. This phrase underscores the trust and confidence that God's presence instills in His people. In the broader biblical narrative, fear is often contrasted with faith. For instance, in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, God reassures His people not to fear because He is with them. The Israelites' lack of fear is a testament to their reliance on God's promises and His faithfulness, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>but the sea engulfed their enemies</b><br>This part of the verse recalls the miraculous event at the Red Sea, where God parted the waters for the Israelites to cross on dry ground, only to bring the waters back upon the pursuing Egyptian army. This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, demonstrating God's power and judgment against those who oppose His people. It serves as a type of baptism, symbolizing the death of the old life of slavery and the birth of a new life of freedom. The destruction of the Egyptians is also a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>, where death is swallowed up in victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the protector and guide of His people, leading them safely.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God led safely, representing His chosen nation whom He delivered from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Refers to the Red Sea, which God parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The enemies of the Israelites who pursued them and were engulfed by the sea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, a foundational moment in Israel's history demonstrating God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithful_guidance.htm">God's Faithful Guidance</a></b><br>Just as God led the Israelites safely, He continues to guide His people today.
