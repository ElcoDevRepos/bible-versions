Throughout biblical history, God revealed His power through miraculous events such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12), the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14), and the conquest of Canaan (Joshua 6-12). These acts served as tangible evidence of His divine authority and faithfulness to His covenant promises. The power of God's works is also evident in creation itself, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the universe into existence. This phrase underscores the importance of recognizing God's active role in the world and His ability to intervene in human affairs.<p><b>by giving them the inheritance of the nations</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The "inheritance of the nations" signifies the territories that were occupied by various peoples, which God promised to Israel as their possession. This was realized during the conquest under Joshua, where the land was divided among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 13-21). Theologically, this inheritance is a type of the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate inheritance of the Kingdom of God, where believers from all nations will partake in the eternal promises of God (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>The recipients of God's mighty works and the inheritance of the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the lands and peoples that God promised to Israel as an inheritance, often seen as the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God demonstrates His sovereignty through His mighty works, reminding us that He is in control of all nations and history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>The inheritance of the nations to Israel is a testament to God's faithfulness.
