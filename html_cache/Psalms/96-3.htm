The term "glory" refers to the weightiness and splendor of God's presence and character. In the Old Testament, God's glory was often associated with His presence in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). The call to declare His glory among the nations reflects the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised that through Abraham's descendants, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This is a foreshadowing of the Great Commission in the New Testament, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The phrase also highlights the missionary aspect of Israel's calling, which is fulfilled in the church's mission today.<p><b>His wonders among all peoples</b><br>"Wonders" refers to the miraculous acts and mighty deeds of God, which demonstrate His power and sovereignty. In the biblical narrative, God's wonders include the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna in the wilderness. These acts were not only for Israel's benefit but also served as a testimony to the surrounding nations of God's supremacy (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>). The phrase "among all peoples" underscores the inclusivity of God's revelation and the invitation for all humanity to witness and respond to His works. This aligns with the prophetic vision of a time when all nations will worship the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). In the New Testament, the wonders of God are further revealed through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which are to be proclaimed to all peoples as the ultimate demonstration of God's love and power (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, the psalmist is the one who calls for the declaration of God's glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to all the peoples of the earth, beyond Israel, emphasizing the universal scope of God's glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wonderful_deeds.htm">God's Wonderful Deeds</a></b><br>These are the acts of God that demonstrate His power, love, and faithfulness, such as creation, deliverance, and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_mission.htm">Universal Mission</a></b><br>The call to declare God's glory is not limited to a specific group but extends to all believers.
