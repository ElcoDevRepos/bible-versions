The term "worm" in Hebrew is "tola'at," which can refer to a maggot or a crimson worm used for dye. This imagery suggests extreme lowliness and insignificance. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, being likened to a worm would convey utter worthlessness and vulnerability. This expression of profound humility and suffering is often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of Christ's own humiliation and suffering on the cross, as He took on the sins of humanity and was treated with contempt.<p><b>scorned by men</b><br>The psalmist expresses being ridiculed and mocked by others. This scorn is not just personal but public, indicating a widespread rejection. In the historical context, public scorn was a severe form of social ostracism, often reserved for those considered cursed or condemned. This phrase connects to the New Testament accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, where He was mocked by soldiers, religious leaders, and passersby (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). The scorn He endured fulfills the prophetic nature of this psalm, highlighting the Messiah's suffering and rejection by humanity.<p><b>and despised by the people</b><br>The term "despised" indicates a deep-seated contempt and rejection. In biblical times, being despised by the community meant being cut off from social and religious life, often seen as a sign of divine disfavor. This phrase underscores the collective rejection faced by the psalmist, which is mirrored in the life of Jesus Christ. <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men," further linking this psalm to the suffering servant motif. The rejection by "the people" can be seen as representative of Israel's initial rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, as well as humanity's broader rejection of God's anointed one.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing deep anguish and feelings of abandonment, which prophetically point to the suffering of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Psalm 22 is often seen as a messianic psalm, with this verse reflecting the humiliation and suffering Jesus endured, particularly during His crucifixion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to those who scorn and despise, representing both the immediate context of David's adversaries and the broader prophetic fulfillment in the rejection of Christ by the people of His time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_humility.htm">Understanding Humility</a></b><br>The term "worm" (Hebrew: tola'at) signifies extreme humility and lowliness.
