Plowing and breaking up the soil were essential for preparing the ground for planting, symbolizing disruption and transformation. In biblical literature, plowing often represents judgment or preparation for new growth (<a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a>, <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>). The act of breaking the soil can also symbolize the breaking of human pride or the hard-heartedness of people, making them receptive to God's word (<a href="/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24-29</a>).<p><b>so our bones have been scattered</b><br>The scattering of bones is a vivid image of defeat and disgrace, often associated with the aftermath of battle or divine judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/8.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>). In ancient Israelite culture, proper burial was crucial for honoring the dead, and the scattering of bones would have been seen as a profound dishonor. This imagery may also reflect the psalmist's sense of vulnerability and exposure to enemies, as well as a plea for divine intervention and restoration.<p><b>at the mouth of Sheol</b><br>Sheol in the Hebrew Bible is often depicted as the realm of the dead, a shadowy place where the deceased reside (<a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>, <a href="/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3-5</a>). The "mouth of Sheol" suggests proximity to death or the brink of the grave, emphasizing the psalmist's dire situation. This phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for the threat of annihilation or the overwhelming power of death. In Christian theology, Sheol is sometimes understood as a precursor to the concept of hell, and the psalmist's cry can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's victory over death and the grave (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/141.htm">Psalm 141</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of vulnerability and seeking God's protection and guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the realm of the dead, often depicted as a place of darkness and separation from the living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/imagery_of_plowing.htm">Imagery of Plowing</a></b><br>The act of plowing and breaking up soil is used metaphorically to describe destruction or scattering, emphasizing the depth of despair or defeat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_despair.htm">Understanding Despair</a></b><br>Recognize that even the faithful experience moments of deep despair and vulnerability.

But the abrupt transition is not unlikely in Hebrew poetry, and the more difficult reading is according to rule to be preserved.<p>The figure is mistaken in the Authorised Version. The reference is not to the ground strewn with the logs left by a woodcutter, but to the clods of earth left by the plough. Keeping the present text, and making the figure refer to the righteous, we should naturally compare <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm" title="The plowers plowed on my back: they made long their furrows.">Psalm 129:3</a>, where ploughing is used as an image of affliction and torture, as "harrewing" is with us.
