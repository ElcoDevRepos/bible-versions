The Hebrew word for "breath" here is "hebel," which is also used in Ecclesiastes to describe vanity or futility. This comparison highlights the brevity and insubstantiality of human existence. In the biblical context, this reflects the understanding that life is temporary and fragile, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which describes life as a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The imagery of breath also connects to the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into man, underscoring the dependence of human life on God's sustaining power.<p><b>his days are like a passing shadow.</b><br>The metaphor of a "passing shadow" further illustrates the ephemeral nature of human life. Shadows are insubstantial and temporary, changing with the movement of the sun and disappearing with the onset of darkness. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>, to convey the swift passage of time and the impermanence of human endeavors. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of life as uncertain and subject to the divine will. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the eternal nature of God in contrast to human mortality, encouraging reliance on God's eternal promises. This concept is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are urged to focus on eternal rather than temporal things, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a warrior and poet.
