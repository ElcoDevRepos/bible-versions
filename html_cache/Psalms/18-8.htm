In ancient Near Eastern culture, smoke and fire were common symbols of a deity's presence and wrath. The depiction of smoke rising from the nostrils suggests a fierce, almost volcanic, expression of God's righteous indignation. This phrase can be connected to other biblical instances where God's presence is accompanied by smoke, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), emphasizing His holiness and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence.<p><b>and consuming fire came from His mouth</b><br>Fire is frequently used in the Bible to symbolize God's judgment and purification. The consuming fire from God's mouth indicates His ability to destroy evil and purify His people. This can be linked to passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, where God is described as a "consuming fire," highlighting His role as a judge. The imagery also foreshadows the final judgment, where God's word will be the ultimate authority. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a precursor to the words of Christ, who speaks with authority and power (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p><b>glowing coals blazed forth</b><br>Glowing coals represent the intense heat and energy of God's presence. In the ancient world, coals were a source of light and heat, symbolizing both life and destruction. This imagery can be connected to <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>, where a seraphim uses a live coal to purify Isaiah's lips, signifying cleansing and commissioning. The blazing coals here emphasize the transformative power of God's presence, capable of both judgment and renewal. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who purifies and refines believers through His sacrifice and the work of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and awe for God's deliverance from his enemies, including King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted with vivid imagery to convey His power and wrath against evil.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The adversaries from whom God delivered David, representing the forces of evil and opposition.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned, the imagery of smoke and fire recalls God's presence at Mount Sinai during the giving of the Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/theophany.htm">Theophany</a></b><br>The event of God revealing Himself in a dramatic and powerful way, often accompanied by natural phenomena like fire and smoke.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_power.htm">God's Holiness and Power</a></b><br>The imagery of smoke and fire illustrates God's absolute holiness and His power to judge and purify.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_deliverance.htm">Divine Protection and Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as God delivered David from his enemies, He is our protector and deliverer in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_god's_wrath.htm">The Reality of God's Wrath</a></b><br>God's wrath against sin is real and should lead us to a reverent fear and respect for His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_fire_in_scripture.htm">Symbolism of Fire in Scripture</a></b><br>Fire often symbolizes purification and judgment, reminding us of the need for personal holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_our_lives.htm">God's Presence in Our Lives</a></b><br>The dramatic imagery encourages us to seek and recognize God's powerful presence in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_18_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 18:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_18_8_God_s_power_anger_vs_sin.htm">How does Psalm 18:8 illustrate God's power and righteous anger against sin?
