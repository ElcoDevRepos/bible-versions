In the Old Testament, the idea of being "set apart" is often associated with holiness and being chosen by God for a specific purpose. The Hebrew word for "godly" here can also be translated as "faithful" or "devout," indicating those who are in a covenant relationship with God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God choosing Israel as His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>) and parallels the New Testament teaching of believers being chosen in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). The setting apart of the godly underscores God's sovereignty and His intimate involvement in the lives of His people, ensuring their protection and guidance.<p><b>the LORD hears when I call to Him.</b><br>This assurance of being heard by God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, highlighting the personal relationship between the psalmist and the LORD. It reflects the confidence that God is attentive to the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, prayer was a vital part of worship and daily life, and the belief that God hears and responds to prayer was foundational. This phrase also connects to the New Testament promise that God hears the prayers of believers (1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>). The assurance of being heard by God is a source of comfort and strength, reinforcing the trust in God's faithfulness and responsiveness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4</a>, David is expressing his confidence in God's protection and favor towards the godly.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal relationship with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_godly.htm">The Godly (Chasid)</a></b><br>Refers to those who are faithful and devoted to God, often translated from the Hebrew word "chasid," which implies kindness, piety, and loyalty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_special_relationship_with_the_godly.htm">God's Special Relationship with the Godly</a></b><br>God has a unique and intimate relationship with those who are devoted to Him.
