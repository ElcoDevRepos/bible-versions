Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, endured years of hardship in Egypt. His prediction, or dream, was that he would rise to a position of authority, as seen in <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>. This period of waiting is a common theme in Scripture, where God's promises often require patience and faith, as seen in the lives of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>). The fulfillment of Joseph's dreams is a testament to God's faithfulness and sovereignty, illustrating that His timing is perfect.<p><b>and the word of the LORD proved him right</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine validation of Joseph's dreams. The "word of the LORD" refers to God's revelation and promises, which are always true and reliable. In Joseph's case, his rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>) confirmed the truth of his earlier dreams. This serves as a reminder of the power and authority of God's word, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where it is stated that God's word will not return void. Joseph's story is also a type of Christ, as both were rejected by their own, suffered unjustly, and were ultimately exalted to positions of authority, prefiguring the suffering and exaltation of Jesus (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The primary figure referenced in this verse.

Those visions of sheaves and stars promised exaltation, yet they landed Joseph in a pit and then in an Egyptian prison (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23-28</a>; 39:20).<p>&#8226; Years passed&#8212;thirteen, to be exact&#8212;before those dreams materialized. <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a> notes Joseph was thirty when elevated; he was seventeen when sold. God allowed long seasons of waiting much like He did for Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>; 21:5) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The delay was not wasted time. <a href="/psalms/66-10.htm">Psalm 66:10-12</a> speaks of the Lord refining His servants; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a> echoes that trials produce maturity. Joseph&#8217;s wait forged character, wisdom, and administrative skill, preparing him for Pharaoh&#8217;s court.<p>&#8226; Believers today can take heart: apparent postponements are purposeful. <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> assures us that God is weaving every thread&#8212;betrayal, false accusation, confinement&#8212;into a tapestry that fulfills His explicit promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the word of the LORD proved him right</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The word of the LORD&#8221; refers both to Joseph&#8217;s original dreams and to God&#8217;s broader covenant promises (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20-24</a>). When Pharaoh later proclaimed, &#8220;Can we find anyone like this man, in whom is the Spirit of God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>), heaven&#8217;s verdict over Joseph became public fact.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights this pattern: God speaks, time tests, then fulfillment vindicates. Consider Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a>; 8:18-19), Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>; 12:31-32), and the ultimate example&#8212;Christ, whose resurrection validated every prophecy (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-46</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;proved him right&#8221; underscores the inerrancy of God&#8217;s word. <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> promises it will not return void; <a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a> affirms not one word fails. Joseph&#8217;s life showcases that reliability in technicolor.<p>&#8226; This vindication also protected an entire nation, preserving the Messianic line (<a href="/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23-24</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5-7</a>). When God&#8217;s word is confirmed, blessings ripple far beyond the individual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a> captures a divine timetable: God&#8217;s spoken promise is followed by refining delays until the precise moment He decrees. For Joseph, the prison door shut until the palace gate opened, proving both God&#8217;s message and His messenger true. The verse calls every believer to trust the Lord&#8217;s perfect timing, confident that every promise in Scripture will stand vindicated just as surely as Joseph&#8217;s did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/105.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Until the time that his word came</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, until his (Joseph's) interpretation of the dreams was fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/41-12.htm" title="And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.">Genesis 41:12</a>).
