In biblical times, a name was more than just an identifier; it represented the character and essence of a person. God's name is often associated with His attributes, such as holiness, power, and love. The call to bless His name forever reflects the perpetual worship and reverence due to God. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's eternal reign, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals Himself as "I AM," indicating His timeless existence. The idea of blessing God's name is also found in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>), where Jesus teaches His disciples to hallow God's name.<p><b>may all the earth be filled with His glory.</b><br>This phrase expresses a prophetic vision of God's glory covering the earth, reminiscent of the promise in <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>, which states that "the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea." It reflects the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom on earth, where His presence and majesty are recognized universally. This vision is also echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>, where the glory of God illuminates the New Jerusalem. The phrase suggests a future hope where God's glory is not confined to Israel but extends to all nations, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant that through his offspring, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>Amen and amen.</b><br>The repetition of "amen" serves as a strong affirmation of the preceding statements. "Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," and its use here underscores the certainty and earnestness of the prayer. In biblical literature, repetition is often used for emphasis, indicating the importance and truth of the declaration. This double "amen" is found in other scriptural contexts, such as in the Psalms and the teachings of Jesus, who often used "verily, verily" (translated from "amen, amen") to emphasize the truth of His words (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). The use of "amen" at the conclusion of prayers and doxologies signifies agreement and trust in God's promises and the fulfillment of His divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom and wealth. This psalm is often seen as a prayer for his reign and a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>King David, Solomon's father, is often associated with the Psalms. <a href="/bsb/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a> is sometimes considered a prayer of David for his son Solomon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is the primary context for the psalm, reflecting the hope for a righteous and prosperous reign that would bless the entire earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messiah.htm">Messiah</a></b><br>The psalm is seen as prophetic, pointing to the ultimate reign of the Messiah, who will fulfill the prayer for a kingdom filled with God's glory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The psalm envisions a time when the entire earth will be filled with God's glory, indicating a universal scope of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_eternal_nature_of_god's_glory.htm">The Eternal Nature of God's Glory</a></b><br>God's name and glory are eternal, transcending time and human history.

Praising that name is more than mouthing a title; it is delighting in everything He has shown Himself to be (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forever&#8221; pushes the gaze beyond any single generation.

The perfect King&#8217;s reign is ultimately global; Solomon&#8217;s limited rule points forward to Christ&#8217;s universal one (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p>&#8226; To pray &#8220;may the earth be filled&#8221; expresses confidence that God&#8217;s mission will succeed.
