At this time, the family of Abraham was small, emphasizing their vulnerability and dependence on God's promises. This small beginning is significant in biblical history, as it highlights God's ability to fulfill His promises despite seemingly insurmountable odds. The promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> that his descendants would become a great nation underscores the miraculous growth from a small family to a populous nation.<p><b>Few indeed</b><br>The repetition of "few" emphasizes the insignificance of their numbers in the context of the larger populations around them. This serves to highlight God's providence and protection over them. It also reflects the theme of God choosing the weak and insignificant to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). The smallness of their numbers is a testament to God's faithfulness in preserving and multiplying them despite their initial insignificance.<p><b>And strangers in the land</b><br>The patriarchs were sojourners in Canaan, living as foreigners in a land that was promised to them but not yet possessed. This status as "strangers" is a recurring theme in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who lived in tents and moved frequently (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>). It underscores the transient nature of their existence and their reliance on God's promise of a future inheritance. This concept of being strangers and pilgrims is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as aliens and strangers in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in a heavenly kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham_and_sarah.htm">Abraham and Sarah</a></b><br>The patriarch and matriarch of the Israelites, who were called by God to leave their homeland and journey to a land He would show them. They were the beginning of God's covenant people, often few in number and strangers in foreign lands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants.

Verse 12 opens with the reminder that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob began as a very small family unit. <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> shows only Abraham and Sarah stepping out in faith; by <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5-6</a>, the promise of countless descendants is contrasted with the single, childless couple. God keeps count of every individual in His covenant family, as seen again in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7</a> where Israel is told, &#8220;The LORD set His affection on you and chose you, because you were the fewest of all peoples.&#8221; Though tiny, they were never insignificant to Him.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God delights in starting great works with small beginnings.<p>&#8226; Numerical weakness magnifies divine strength (cf. <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Each believer today can rest in the truth that God values even the &#8220;few&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>few indeed</b><p>The repetition underscores vulnerability. <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a> counts only seventy members when Jacob&#8217;s clan enters Egypt. Humanly speaking, such a handful could be erased by famine, conflict, or assimilation. Yet the very next verses in <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> (vv. 13-15) highlight how God &#8220;allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf.&#8221; He guards the fragile until His purposes ripen (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a> speaks of explosive growth after the period of being &#8220;few indeed&#8221;).<p>Points to notice:<p>&#8226; Double emphasis shows God&#8217;s people have no strength apart from Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; History validates that His covenant promises never depend on majority status.<p>&#8226; Encouragement for modern believers: apparent smallness is not defeat but stage-setting for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and strangers in the land</b><p>Abraham lived in tents &#8220;as a stranger in a foreign country&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>). <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> reminds readers that the patriarchs possessed no legal claim to Canaan at first; <a href="/bsb/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a> records Abraham negotiating just to buy a burial plot.
