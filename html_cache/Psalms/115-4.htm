These metals were not only valuable but also symbolized wealth and power. The use of precious metals in idol-making highlights the human tendency to attribute worth and divinity to material possessions. This phrase contrasts the living God with lifeless idols, emphasizing the futility of worshiping objects made from earthly materials. The Bible frequently condemns idolatry, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the absurdity of worshiping man-made objects is mocked. The use of silver and gold also reflects the economic and cultural practices of the time, where such materials were often associated with religious and royal authority.<p><b>made by the hands of men</b><br>This phrase underscores the human origin of idols, contrasting them with the divine creation of the universe by God. The emphasis on "hands of men" points to the limited and flawed nature of human craftsmanship compared to God's omnipotence. In biblical theology, this highlights the folly of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>, where idols are described as powerless and dependent on human intervention. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the first two commandments given to Moses, which prohibit the making and worshiping of graven images (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who, unlike idols, is not made by human hands but is the incarnate Word of God, fully divine and fully human, as described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who contrasts the living God with lifeless idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made from silver and gold, representing false gods that the nations around Israel worshipped.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, called to worship Him alone and reject idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who worshipped idols, often leading Israel into temptation and sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The place where the true God was worshipped, contrasting with the temples of idols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, though made of precious materials, are lifeless and powerless.

Fashioned into a human shape, as if they were sentient being - but absolutely devoid of all sense and intelligence. The satire is somewhat roughly worked out (vers. 5-7), but idolatry provokes rough speaking; and the tone here adopted is imitated in <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>, and echoed in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>.
