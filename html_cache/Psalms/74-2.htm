The term "congregation" refers to the assembly of God's people, often used in the Old Testament to describe the Israelites. This plea is rooted in the covenant relationship established between God and Israel, where God promised to be their God and they His people (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). The psalmist is invoking God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>which You purchased long ago</b><br>The concept of God "purchasing" His people is tied to the idea of redemption. In the context of Israel, this refers to the Exodus from Egypt, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery, symbolizing a purchase or redemption (<a href="/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>). This act established Israel as God's possession, a theme echoed in the New Testament with Christ's redemptive work for believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>).<p><b>and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance</b><br>The term "redeemed" further emphasizes the deliverance and salvation God provided. The "tribe of Your inheritance" signifies Israel's unique status as God's chosen people, set apart for His purposes. This inheritance is not just a physical land but a spiritual relationship with God. The idea of inheritance is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><b>Mount Zion, where You dwell</b><br>Mount Zion holds significant theological and historical importance as the location of Jerusalem and the Temple, representing God's presence among His people. It is often used symbolically to refer to God's kingdom and His eternal dwelling place. In prophetic literature, Zion is depicted as the center of God's future kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>). In the New Testament, Zion is associated with the heavenly Jerusalem, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to dwell with His people (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).<div

congregation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He isn&#8217;t hinting that God forgets; rather, he is appealing to the covenant faithfulness God Himself established (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24&#8211;25</a>, <a href="/psalms/98-3.htm">Psalm 98:3</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, to &#8220;remember&#8221; means to act on behalf of a promise. When Noah was in the ark, &#8220;God remembered Noah&#8221; and sent a wind to dry the waters (<a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The congregation is God&#8217;s carefully gathered people, much like a shepherd counts and cares for each sheep (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>; <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p>Because God&#8217;s character is unchanging (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>), the psalmist is confident that calling on Him to &#8220;remember&#8221; is an invitation for Him to move in mercy once again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which You purchased long ago</b><p>The next phrase grounds the plea in history: God &#8220;purchased&#8221; His people.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Purchased&#8221; points back to the Exodus, when the Lord bought Israel&#8217;s freedom from slavery with mighty acts (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Purchase establishes ownership; the people belong to God, not to Pharaoh, not to the nations, not even to themselves (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This foreshadows Christ&#8217;s work: the church is said to be &#8220;purchased with His own blood&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>).<p>The psalmist is reminding God&#8212;and himself&#8212;that divine investment guarantees divine interest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance</b><p>&#8220;Redeemed&#8221; intensifies the idea of purchase: it is the rescue of what would otherwise be lost.<p>&#8226; By calling Israel &#8220;the tribe of Your inheritance,&#8221; the psalmist underlines chosenness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6&#8211;8</a>) and lasting value (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Inheritance speaks of permanence; once allotted, it remains (<a href="/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, redemption secures us &#8220;until the redemption of the purchased possession&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>), promising that God guards what is His.<p>So Asaph anchors his appeal in God&#8217;s unbreakable commitment to keep what He has redeemed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mount Zion, where You dwell</b><p>The verse concludes at the physical and spiritual center of Israel&#8217;s life.<p>&#8226; Mount Zion housed the temple, the visible symbol of God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; To mention Zion is to remind God of the place He chose for His name, the throne of His earthly reign.<p>&#8226; Zion also anticipates the ultimate gathering of God&#8217;s people in &#8220;the heavenly Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>) and the future scene where &#8220;the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist expects God to defend His dwelling; if Zion is overrun, God&#8217;s honor is at stake.<p>Here, location and relationship merge: wherever God dwells, He actively protects.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a> is a layered, covenant-based appeal. Asaph reminds God of His people, His purchase, His redemption, and His chosen dwelling. Each phrase stacks an argument: You formed us, bought us, rescued us, and placed Your name among us&#8212;therefore act now. For believers today, the verse fuels confidence that the God who once rescued and indwelt His people still remembers, still owns, still redeems, and still dwells among those who are His in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/74.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Purchased.</span>--Or, as in LXX<span class= "bld">., </span><span class= "ital">acquired. </span>This word, together with the word "redeemed" in the next clause, and "right hand" in <a href="/psalms/74-11.htm" title="Why withdraw you your hand, even your right hand? pluck it out of your bosom.">Psalm 74:11</a>, show that Exodus 15 was in the writer's mind.
