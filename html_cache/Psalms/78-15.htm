The act of splitting the rocks signifies God's power and ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations. The wilderness, often associated with desolation and scarcity, becomes a place of divine intervention and sustenance. This event underscores God's faithfulness and His role as a provider, echoing the theme of reliance on God throughout the Israelites' journey. The rock is also seen as a type of Christ, as Paul notes in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where he describes Christ as the spiritual rock that accompanied them.<p><b>and gave them drink as abundant as the seas</b><br>This phrase highlights the abundance of God's provision. The comparison to the seas emphasizes the vastness and sufficiency of the water provided, ensuring that the needs of the entire Israelite community were met. This abundance contrasts with the barrenness of the wilderness, showcasing God's ability to transform lack into plenty. The imagery of water is significant throughout Scripture, often symbolizing life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit. In <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, Jesus speaks of the living water He provides, which will become a spring of water welling up to eternal life, drawing a parallel to the life-sustaining water given to the Israelites. This provision in the wilderness serves as a foreshadowing of the spiritual nourishment and eternal life offered through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and provision for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's miraculous provision during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rocks.htm">Rocks</a></b><br>The physical objects that God miraculously split to provide water for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The broader event encompassing the Israelites' journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_desperation.htm">God's Provision in Desperation</a></b><br>God provides for His people even in the most barren and desperate situations.

Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). The Psalmist treats that account as literal fact, celebrating God&#8217;s direct intervention in the physical world.<p>&#8226; The setting&#8212;&#8220;the wilderness&#8221;&#8212;highlights human helplessness. No hidden springs existed; God Himself had to act. <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>&#8217;s larger context stresses Israel&#8217;s repeated unbelief despite witnessing such unmistakable power (vv. 17&#8211;22).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s act of splitting rock underscores His sovereign mastery over creation (<a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/114-7.htm">Psalm 114:7&#8211;8</a>). What seems immovable yields instantly to His word, reminding believers that no obstacle can prevent His purposes.<p>&#8226; The New Testament ties the smitten rock to Christ: &#8220;They drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>). The physical miracle thus also foreshadows the once-for-all provision of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave them drink as abundant as the seas</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s supply wasn&#8217;t a trickle but &#8220;as abundant as the seas.&#8221; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a> reports that water &#8220;flowed out abundantly, and the congregation and their livestock drank.&#8221; The imagery stresses lavish grace, not bare-minimum sustenance (compare <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This abundance addressed millions of Israelites plus their animals&#8212;clear evidence of divine omnipotence and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The superabundance anticipates Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;Whoever believes in Me&#8230; rivers of living water will flow from within him&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>). Physical refreshment in the desert points forward to spiritual fullness in the Messiah.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> revisits the same episode to inspire praise: &#8220;He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.&#8221; The repetition throughout Scripture insists that believers remember and rely on God&#8217;s overflowing provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a> declares a real, historical miracle revealing God&#8217;s power to override nature and His heart to pour out more than enough for His people.
