The "burden" symbolizes the oppressive labor and harsh conditions the Israelites endured under Pharaoh's rule. In <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>, the Israelites were forced into hard labor, building store cities for Pharaoh. The relief from this burden signifies God's intervention and liberation, as seen in the Exodus narrative. This deliverance is a type of Christ's redemptive work, freeing believers from the burden of sin (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>his hands were freed from the basket.</b><br>The "basket" refers to the tools or containers used by the Israelites in their labor, possibly for carrying bricks or straw. This imagery highlights the physical toil and subjugation they experienced. The liberation of their hands signifies a complete release from bondage, emphasizing God's power to deliver. This freedom is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are freed from the law's demands and sin's bondage through Christ (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>). The historical context of Egyptian slavery underscores the miraculous nature of the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history and a foreshadowing of spiritual freedom in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is the deliverer and sustainer of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God delivered from slavery in Egypt, symbolized by the removal of burdens.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage and slavery for the Israelites, representing oppression and hardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, a central theme in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, though not directly mentioned, is a key figure in the context of deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_deliverer.htm">God as Deliverer</a></b><br>God is faithful to relieve His people from their burdens, both physical and spiritual.
