The imagery of the dawn suggests a new beginning and the dispelling of darkness, symbolizing the revelation of one's righteousness. In biblical context, dawn often represents hope and renewal (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). The assurance here is that God will make the righteousness of His people evident, just as the dawn is unmistakable. This can be connected to the promise of vindication found in <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, where righteousness is described as breaking forth like the dawn. The dawn also signifies the coming of Christ, the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), who brings truth and righteousness.<p><b>your justice like the noonday sun</b><br>The noonday sun is the brightest and most visible part of the day, symbolizing clarity and full revelation. This phrase assures that justice will be as evident and undeniable as the sun at its peak. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the sun was a powerful symbol of God's presence and favor (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>). The promise of justice being as clear as the noonday sun reflects God's commitment to uphold truth and righteousness. This can be linked to the ultimate justice brought by Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>). The noonday sun also signifies the full revelation of God's kingdom, where justice prevails eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, King David, is writing to encourage believers to trust in the Lord and live righteously.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who follow God's ways and trust in Him, as described in the psalm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and live in sin, often contrasted with the righteous throughout <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The central figure who acts on behalf of the righteous, ensuring their righteousness and justice are revealed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dawn_and_noonday_sun.htm">The Dawn and Noonday Sun</a></b><br>Metaphors used to describe the clarity and visibility of the righteousness and justice that God will bring forth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Just as the dawn and noonday sun follow a natural order, trust that God will reveal your righteousness in His perfect timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/live_righteously.htm">Live Righteously</a></b><br>Commit to living a life that reflects God's righteousness, knowing that He will make it evident to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_justice.htm">Seek Justice</a></b><br>Actively pursue justice in your life and community, trusting that God will bring it to light.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/be_patient_in_trials.htm">Be Patient in Trials</a></b><br>Understand that vindication may not be immediate, but God promises to reveal the truth in due time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflect_god's_light.htm">Reflect God's Light</a></b><br>As God brings forth your righteousness, strive to be a reflection of His light in a dark world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_37_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 37:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_to_reveal_your_righteousness.htm">How can we trust God to "make your righteousness shine like the dawn"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_6_on_God_revealing_righteousness.htm">What does Psalm 37:6 teach about God's role in revealing our righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_6_Matt_5_16_connection.htm">How does Psalm 37:6 connect with Matthew 5:16 about letting our light shine?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_actively_await_God_s_justice.htm">In what ways can we actively wait for God to vindicate us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_37_6_to_daily_life.htm">How can we apply the promise of Psalm 37:6 in daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_6_and_divine_justice_link.htm">How does Psalm 37:6 relate to the concept of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_37_6.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 37:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Archaeology_s_link_to_Psalm_37_6_themes.htm">How does archaeology support the themes found in Psalm 37:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible_miracle_examples.htm">What does the Bible teach about hate?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_job_12_6_align_with_wicked's_fate.htm">In Job 12:6, how does the idea that 'the tents of robbers are at peace' harmonize with other scriptures that insist the wicked are eventually punished?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_wicked_people_prosper_despite_psalm_37_9.htm">How can Psalm 37:9 ('evildoers shall be cut off') be taken seriously when many wicked individuals throughout history have lived long and prosperous lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_finds_joy_in_humility_and_virtue.htm">Who finds true happiness in humility and righteousness?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 37:6 Mean</div><b>He will bring forth</b><p>&#8226; The subject is the LORD Himself.
