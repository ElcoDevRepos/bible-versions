The "day of trouble" can refer to any period of distress or danger, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual. Biblically, days of trouble are often times when God's people are tested, as seen in the lives of Job and David. The Psalms frequently address such times, offering assurance of God's presence and deliverance (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). Historically, David faced numerous days of trouble, including threats from King Saul and his own son Absalom, which may have inspired this psalm.<p><b>He will hide me in His shelter</b><br>The imagery of God as a shelter is prevalent throughout Scripture, symbolizing protection and refuge. The "shelter" can be understood as God's divine presence, offering safety from external threats. In ancient Israel, cities of refuge provided physical safety, reflecting God's spiritual protection. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, where dwelling in the "shelter of the Most High" assures security. Theologically, this points to God's sovereignty and care for His people, offering a foretaste of the ultimate refuge found in Christ.<p><b>He will conceal me under the cover of His tent</b><br>The "tent" refers to the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God among His people during the wilderness journey. It signifies God's intimate presence and the sacred space where He meets with His people. The act of being concealed under its cover suggests divine protection and favor. This imagery connects to the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the Word who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), indicating God's presence through Christ. The tent also symbolizes the believer's spiritual security in God's presence.<p><b>He will set me high upon a rock</b><br>Being set "high upon a rock" conveys a position of safety and stability, out of reach from enemies. In biblical times, high places were strategic for defense, offering a vantage point against attackers. The rock symbolizes strength and permanence, often associated with God Himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). This imagery is prophetic of Christ, the "rock" of salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>), who provides a firm foundation for believers. The phrase assures that God elevates and secures His people, offering them a place of refuge and victory over adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep faith and reliance on God amidst trials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelter.htm">Shelter</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's protection, the "shelter" represents a place of safety and refuge provided by God during times of trouble.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent.htm">Tent</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, the "tent" often refers to the Tabernacle, a sacred place where God's presence dwelt among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rock.htm">Rock</a></b><br>A metaphor for stability and security, the "rock" signifies a firm foundation and elevated position above danger, provided by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_trouble.htm">Day of Trouble</a></b><br>Represents times of distress or adversity that believers may face, highlighting the need for divine intervention and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_our_refuge.htm">God as Our Refuge</a></b><br>In times of trouble, God provides a safe haven.

Trouble is assumed, not optional. Throughout Scripture God acknowledges that His people face adversity (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>). David speaks from experience&#8212;he had fled Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>), battled Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>), and endured family betrayal (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>). Yet every crisis became an opportunity to discover God&#8217;s reliability. The &#8220;day of trouble&#8221; therefore is any circumstance that exceeds our own strength and pushes us to lean wholly on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-7.htm">Nahum 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will hide me in His shelter</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220; He will hide me in His shelter &#8221;. David pictures God as the Owner of a fortified refuge, personally drawing His child inside. Similar imagery appears in <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>, &#8220;You hide them in the secret place of Your presence.&#8221; Noah&#8217;s family experienced this on a global scale when God shut them inside the ark (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>). The promise is not escapism but protection while trouble rages outside. Notice the verb &#8220;will&#8221;&#8212;certain, not tentative. As surely as the Lord shielded Israel beneath the pillar of cloud from Pharaoh&#8217;s army (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>), He pledges to shelter believers today (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will conceal me under the cover of His tent</b><p>Next, &#8220; He will conceal me under the cover of His tent &#8221;. The focus narrows from a broad shelter to the intimate space of God&#8217;s own dwelling, echoing <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221; In the wilderness tabernacle only priests could enter, yet David anticipates a grace that welcomes him inside (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-2</a>). To be &#8220;concealed&#8221; under God&#8217;s tent suggests:<p>&#8226; Personal nearness&#8212;like Ruth under Boaz&#8217;s wing (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Complete security&#8212;hidden from sight where the enemy cannot reach (<a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Sacred fellowship&#8212;the tent is where worship happens (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>), so protection and communion are intertwined.<p>Jesus fulfills this image by &#8220;tabernacling&#8221; among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and opening the way into God&#8217;s presence through His blood (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will set me high upon a rock</b><p>Finally, &#8220; He will set me high upon a rock &#8221;. After hiding and concealing, God elevates. The rock is immovable, lifting the believer above flood and foe alike, much like the cliff-fortresses David knew in Engedi (<a href="/1_samuel/23-29.htm">1 Samuel 23:29</a>). Other passages echo this: &#8220;From the ends of the earth I call to You&#8230; lead me to the rock that is higher than I&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a>); &#8220;My God is my rock&#8230; my stronghold&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>). For New Testament believers, Christ Himself is that rock (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>). Spiritual elevation produces:<p>&#8226; Perspective&#8212;seeing circumstances from God&#8217;s vantage (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Stability&#8212;storms may pound the heights, but the foundation stands firm (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Victory&#8212;high ground is strategic ground; &#8220;God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a> assures that when trouble comes, the Lord does four things: He acknowledges the reality of our crisis, draws us into His fortified refuge, ushers us into intimate fellowship within His very dwelling, and finally sets us securely above the fray on the unshakable rock of His own presence. Every phrase layers certainty upon certainty, inviting believers to rest in the unbreakable promise that God Himself is both our hiding place and our elevation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Pavilion.</span>--A <span class= "ital">booth </span>or <span class= "ital">hut; </span>also of the lair of wild beasts (<a href="/psalms/10-9.htm" title="He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he does catch the poor, when he draws him into his net.">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm" title="He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 25:38</a>).
