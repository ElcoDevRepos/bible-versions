The imagery of a "vapor" suggests something fleeting and insubstantial, echoing themes found in other wisdom literature such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>, where life is described as "vanity" or "meaningless." The Hebrew word for "vapor" is "hebel," which conveys the idea of breath or mist, emphasizing the brevity and fragility of life. This reflects the biblical understanding that all humans, regardless of status, are temporary and dependent on God for their existence.<p><b>the exalted are but a lie.</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to those of high status or wealth, suggesting that their perceived importance is deceptive. The term "lie" implies falsehood or illusion, indicating that worldly power and prestige are not as substantial as they appear. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the ultimate judge of worth and that human pride is often misplaced. <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a> and <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10-11</a> also highlight the futility of relying on riches or status, reinforcing the idea that true value is found in spiritual, not material, wealth.<p><b>Weighed on the scale, they go up;</b><br>This imagery of scales suggests judgment or evaluation, a common biblical metaphor for God's assessment of human actions and character. In <a href="/daniel/5-27.htm">Daniel 5:27</a>, the writing on the wall for King Belshazzar includes the phrase "you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting," indicating divine judgment. The idea that they "go up" suggests that when measured against God's standards, both lowborn and exalted individuals are found lacking, emphasizing the equality of all people before God.<p><b>together they are but a vapor.</b><br>Reiterating the initial metaphor, this phrase underscores the collective insignificance of humanity when viewed from an eternal perspective. The repetition of "vapor" serves to remind readers of the fleeting nature of life, regardless of social status. This echoes <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, which states, "Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure." Theologically, this points to the need for reliance on God rather than human strength or achievement, as only what is done for God will endure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

He encourages the faithful, and warns the wicked, by the declaration that men of every sort "are but vanity" - have no strength, no permanence - while power belongs only to God. Those who "oppress" and "rob" are, consequently, not to be feared - there is no strength in riches - God alone determines the issues of things. Unto him belongs mercy, or loving kindness - a quality which leads him not only to forgive men their transgressions, but to "reward" them, when, by his assisting grace, they have done good works. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie;</span> rather, <span class="accented">only vanity</span> - or, <span class="accented">nought but vanity</span> - <span class="accented">are men of low degree</span>; common men, as we call them - mere sons of Adam. This is too evident for dispute; but, in the view of the psalmist, this is not the worst.
