The imagery of darkened eyes suggests a spiritual blindness, a common biblical metaphor for those who are unable to perceive God's truth. In the context of <a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is calling for justice against those who oppose him, reflecting a broader theme of divine retribution found throughout the Psalms. This concept of spiritual blindness is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8-10</a>, where Paul references this psalm to describe Israel's hardening. The idea of eyes being darkened can also be seen as a type of Christ, who often spoke of those who have eyes but do not see, highlighting the spiritual blindness of those who rejected Him.<p><b>and their backs be bent forever</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of perpetual suffering and subjugation. The imagery of bent backs suggests a burden or oppression, possibly alluding to the physical and spiritual consequences of sin. In the historical context, a bent back could symbolize the labor and toil of slavery or servitude, which was a reality for many in ancient times. This imagery is also prophetic, as it points to the ultimate judgment and separation from God for those who persist in rebellion against Him. The concept of a bent back can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus offers rest to those who are weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), contrasting the freedom found in Christ with the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing deep distress and calling for divine intervention against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals or groups who oppose David, representing those who oppose God's anointed and, by extension, God Himself.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often seen as the context for David's laments and prayers, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_prophecy.htm">Messianic Prophecy</a></b><br>Psalm 69 is often seen as a prophetic psalm, with elements that are later applied to Jesus Christ in the New Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment.htm">Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The event or process by which God enacts justice, often seen in the imprecatory nature of this psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>This verse highlights the danger of spiritual blindness, a condition where individuals are unable to perceive or understand God's truth.
