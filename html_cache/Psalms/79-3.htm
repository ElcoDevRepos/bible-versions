The imagery of blood being poured out like water suggests a massacre, highlighting the brutality and scale of the violence. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, such destruction was not uncommon, and the phrase underscores the desecration of what was considered a holy city. Theologically, this reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as prophesied in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/19-7.htm">Jeremiah 19:7-9</a>, where God warns of scattering His people and the resulting devastation. The phrase also evokes the sacrificial system, where blood was poured out as an offering, contrasting the sacred with the profane.<p><b>all around Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the city of David, was the spiritual and political center of Israel. Its destruction would have been seen as a profound judgment from God. The phrase "all around" indicates the widespread nature of the devastation, affecting not just the city but its surrounding areas. Historically, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict due to its strategic and religious significance. The city's fall would have been a catastrophic event for the Israelites, symbolizing the loss of God's protection and favor. This also foreshadows the future destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, as prophesied by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>.<p><b>and there is no one to bury the dead</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, burial was a sacred duty, and leaving the dead unburied was considered a severe dishonor (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). This phrase indicates the complete desolation and helplessness of the survivors, who were either killed, taken captive, or too few to perform burial rites. The lack of burial also signifies the totality of the judgment, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>, where the dead bodies would be food for the birds and beasts. This situation contrasts with the hope of resurrection and eternal life found in the New Testament, where Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice, conquers death and offers eternal life to believers (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.
