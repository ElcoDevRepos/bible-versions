In a broader biblical context, this verse prophetically points to the suffering of Jesus Christ during His crucifixion. The Gospels recount how Jesus was mocked by onlookers, soldiers, and religious leaders (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>, <a href="/mark/15-29.htm">Mark 15:29-32</a>). The act of mocking is a common theme in the Psalms, often depicting the righteous suffering unjustly at the hands of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15-16</a>, <a href="/psalms/69-12.htm">Psalm 69:12</a>). This phrase highlights the fulfillment of prophecy and the typology of David as a precursor to Christ, who endured similar derision.<p><b>they sneer and shake their heads:</b><br>The gesture of shaking the head is a cultural expression of derision and scorn, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. It signifies contempt and disbelief, often used to humiliate or express disdain. This action is vividly described in the accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, where passersby shook their heads, taunting Him to save Himself if He truly was the Son of God (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>, <a href="/mark/15-29.htm">Mark 15:29</a>). The historical context of this gesture underscores the depth of humiliation experienced by both David and Jesus. It serves as a poignant reminder of the suffering endured by the righteous and the fulfillment of messianic prophecy, as Jesus' experiences mirror those described in the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of abandonment and suffering, which is prophetic of the Messiah's suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mockers.htm">Mockers</a></b><br>The individuals who ridicule and scorn the speaker, representing those who oppose God's anointed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_prophecy.htm">Messianic Prophecy</a></b><br>This verse is often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of the suffering of Jesus Christ, particularly during His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion_of_jesus.htm">Crucifixion of Jesus</a></b><br>The events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion where He was mocked and scorned, fulfilling the prophecy of this Psalm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was crucified, and where the events of His mockery took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that suffering and mockery are part of the Christian experience, as they were for Christ.
