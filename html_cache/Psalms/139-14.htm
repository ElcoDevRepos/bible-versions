Praise is a central theme throughout the Psalms, reflecting a heart of reverence and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and goodness. In the context of ancient Israel, praise was often expressed through song, prayer, and communal worship, as seen in the temple practices. The act of praising God is a response to His character and deeds, aligning with the biblical call to worship found in passages like <a href="/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100</a> and <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>.<p><b>for I am fearfully and wonderfully made</b><br>This acknowledges the intricate and intentional design of human beings by God. The term "fearfully" suggests a sense of awe and reverence, indicating that the creation of human life is a profound and sacred act. "Wonderfully made" highlights the complexity and beauty of God's creation, reflecting His wisdom and power. This aligns with the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humans are made in the image of God, underscoring their unique value and purpose. The phrase also connects to the New Testament, where believers are described as God's workmanship in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>.<p><b>Marvelous are Your works</b><br>This statement recognizes the excellence and grandeur of God's creation and deeds. The word "marvelous" conveys a sense of wonder and admiration, pointing to the extraordinary nature of God's actions. Throughout the Bible, God's works are depicted as both mighty and purposeful, from the creation of the world in Genesis to the miracles performed by Jesus in the Gospels. This phrase invites reflection on the vastness of God's creative power and His ongoing involvement in the world.<p><b>and I know this very well</b><br>This expression of personal conviction and understanding suggests a deep, experiential knowledge of God's works. It implies that the psalmist has witnessed or experienced God's handiwork firsthand, leading to a confident affirmation of faith. This aligns with the biblical theme of knowing God through His creation and His acts in history, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where God's invisible qualities are understood through what has been made. The phrase encourages believers to seek a personal and intimate relationship with God, grounded in the recognition of His presence and activity in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, King David, is expressing his awe and gratitude for God's intricate creation of human life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is praised for His marvelous works and the intricate design of human beings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God creating human beings, highlighting the complexity and intentionality of His work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_value.htm">Understanding Our Value</a></b><br>Recognize that each person is created with intentionality and purpose by God.
