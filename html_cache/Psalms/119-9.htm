The Hebrew culture placed a strong emphasis on purity, both ritual and moral, as seen in the laws given in Leviticus. The question implies a recognition of the challenges faced by youth, such as temptation and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The pursuit of purity is a theme echoed throughout Scripture, notably in Proverbs, which offers wisdom for young men, and in the New Testament, where Paul advises Timothy to flee youthful passions (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p><b>By guarding it according to Your word.</b><br>The answer provided points to the Word of God as the means of maintaining purity. This reflects the high value placed on Scripture within the Jewish tradition, where the Torah was central to life and worship. The term "guarding" suggests vigilance and intentionality, akin to a watchman protecting a city. This aligns with the biblical theme of the Word as a guide and protector, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The concept of guarding one's way according to God's Word is also seen in the life of Jesus, who resisted temptation by quoting Scripture (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), serving as the ultimate example of living in accordance with God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_man.htm">Young Man</a></b><br>Represents not only young men but all believers seeking to live a life of purity and righteousness.

The answer is supposed, or rather left to be inferred, from the whole tenor of the psalm, which is that men, and especially-young men, whose passions and temptations are strong in proportion to their inexperience, can do nothing of themselves, but are dependent on the grace of God. The omission of a direct answer rather strengthens than impairs the impression on the reader.<p>We must not, from the mention of youth, conclude that this psalm was written in that period of life. Perhaps, on the contrary, it is one who, like Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra, while seeking how best to spend old age, looks back on youth, not with remonstrance at its follies, but with the satisfaction that even then he aimed at the best he knew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way</span>?
