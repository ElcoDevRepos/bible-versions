The term "frame" refers to the physical structure or skeleton, highlighting the intricacy of human creation. In biblical context, this reflects the belief that God is aware of every detail of our existence, even before birth. This aligns with passages like <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God declares knowledge of Jeremiah before he was formed in the womb, underscoring the personal relationship God has with each individual.<p><b>when I was made in secret</b><br>The "secret" place refers to the womb, a hidden and protected environment where life begins. This phrase suggests the mysterious and sacred nature of human development, a process known only to God. In ancient times, the understanding of embryology was limited, making the formation of life even more wondrous and attributed to divine craftsmanship. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as the Creator, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humanity is made in God's image.<p><b>when I was woven together</b><br>The imagery of being "woven together" suggests a careful and deliberate act of creation, akin to a skilled weaver crafting a tapestry. This metaphor highlights the complexity and intentionality of God's design. The use of weaving imagery is also found in <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>, where Job speaks of being clothed with skin and flesh, further illustrating the intricate work of God in forming human life.<p><b>in the depths of the earth</b><br>This phrase is metaphorical, referring to the hidden and mysterious process of creation. The "depths of the earth" symbolize a place of origin and formation, much like the womb. In ancient Near Eastern thought, the earth was often seen as a source of life and sustenance. This imagery can also be connected to the resurrection theme, where the earth is a place of burial and new life, as seen in the prophecy of Jesus' resurrection in <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>, drawing a parallel between the earth's depths and the tomb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who is expressing his awe at God's intimate knowledge and creation of him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and omnipresent Creator who is intimately involved in the formation of every individual.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_womb.htm">The Womb</a></b><br>Symbolically referred to as "the depths of the earth," representing the secret and hidden place where God forms life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God forming each person uniquely, highlighting His role as the divine Creator.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_secret_place.htm">The Secret Place</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the hidden and mysterious process of human formation, emphasizing God's unseen work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_intimate_knowledge.htm">God's Intimate Knowledge</a></b><br>Recognize that God knows us more deeply than we know ourselves, having been involved in our creation from the very beginning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_life.htm">Value of Life</a></b><br>Every life is precious and purposefully created by God, which should influence how we view ourselves and others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Understanding that God has been involved in our lives from the start can help us trust His plan and purpose for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_creation.htm">The Mystery of Creation</a></b><br>Embrace the mystery and wonder of God's creative process, which is beyond human comprehension.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/our_identity_in_christ.htm">Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity is rooted in being fearfully and wonderfully made by God, which should shape our self-worth and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_139_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 139:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_139_15_God_s_intimate_creation.htm">How does Psalm 139:15 affirm God's intimate knowledge of our creation?
