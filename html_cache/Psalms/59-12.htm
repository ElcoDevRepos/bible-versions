In biblical context, the tongue is often depicted as a source of both blessing and cursing (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>). The sins of the mouth can include slander, deceit, and blasphemy, which are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). The emphasis on words reflects the belief that speech reveals the heart's condition (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). In ancient Israel, words held significant weight, often used in covenants and oaths, making their misuse particularly grievous.<p><b>let them be trapped in their pride</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This phrase suggests a divine justice where the wicked are ensnared by their arrogance. Pride is seen as a root of many sins, including the rebellion of Satan (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>). Theologically, pride is the elevation of self above God, leading to a lack of repentance and humility. The psalmist's plea for the wicked to be trapped in their pride aligns with the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>in the curses and lies they utter</b><br>Curses and lies are forms of verbal sin that reflect a heart turned away from God. In the cultural context of the Bible, curses were serious pronouncements that invoked harm or misfortune, often believed to have spiritual power (Numbers 22-24). Lies, on the other hand, are condemned as contrary to God's nature, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The psalmist's call for the wicked to be ensnared by their own deceit echoes the biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). This reflects a divine justice where the consequences of one's actions are fittingly returned upon them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a>, who wrote this psalm as a plea for deliverance from his enemies.

The very tool meant for blessing (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>) is being wielded for evil.<p>&#8226; This exposes the enemies&#8217; hypocrisy: while their lips move freely, their hearts remain bound to sin (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let them be trapped in their pride</b><p>Here is David&#8217;s petition for righteous recompense.<p>&#8226; Pride blinds these enemies to their impending downfall, just as Haman was caught by the gallows he built (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays pride as a snare God allows to close on the arrogant (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; Obadiah 3&#8211;4).<p>&#8226; David is asking the Lord to let natural consequences run their course, affirming that God &#8220;opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the curses and lies they utter</b><p>The final clause names the specific forms of speech in view.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Curses&#8221; recall Israel&#8217;s covenant warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15&#8211;26</a>); by hurling curses, the enemies ironically invoke the very judgment they deserve.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Lies&#8221; align them with the devil, &#8220;the father of lies&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), in stark contrast to the God of truth (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; David seeks a moral reversal: let their malicious words ricochet upon them, as <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15&#8211;16</a> describes the wicked falling into the pit they dig.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a> portrays a courtroom scene where speech is evidence.
