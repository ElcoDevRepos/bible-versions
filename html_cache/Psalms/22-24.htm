In the biblical context, the "afflicted" often refers to those who are oppressed or in distress, a theme prevalent throughout the Psalms. The use of "despised" and "detested" indicates a strong rejection, which God does not exhibit towards the suffering. This reflects God's character as one who is close to the brokenhearted (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>). Historically, the afflicted could be seen as the marginalized in society, such as the poor or the sick, whom God consistently defends. This phrase also prophetically points to Jesus Christ, who, during His crucifixion, was not abandoned by God despite His suffering, fulfilling the messianic prophecy of the Psalm.<p><b>He has not hidden His face from him,</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, to "hide one's face" was a metaphor for rejection or disfavor. God's assurance of not hiding His face signifies His continual presence and favor. This is a reassurance of God's faithfulness, contrasting with human tendencies to turn away from those in distress. Biblically, God's face represents His presence and blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the belief that God is always present, even in times of deep suffering, as seen in the life of Jesus, who, despite feeling forsaken on the cross, was ultimately in the presence of the Father.<p><b>but has attended to his cry for help.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's responsiveness to prayer and cries for deliverance. The act of attending implies active listening and intervention. Throughout scripture, God is portrayed as one who hears and responds to the cries of His people (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). This is a recurring theme in the Psalms, where the psalmist often cries out to God in times of trouble and experiences His deliverance. In the New Testament, Jesus exemplifies this divine attribute by responding to those who call out to Him in faith, such as the blind men in <a href="/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30-34</a>. This phrase assures believers of God's readiness to respond to their pleas, reinforcing His role as a compassionate and attentive Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afflicted.htm">The Afflicted</a></b><br>This term refers to those who are suffering or in distress.

Yet by verse 24 the tone changes. Here David states with confidence that God never looks at suffering with contempt.<p>&#8226; Think of <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD is near to the brokenhearted; He saves the contrite in spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a> declares that the Suffering Servant &#8220;took on our infirmities,&#8221; showing how seriously God regards human pain.<p>&#8226; Jesus identifies completely with the afflicted (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>), proving that heaven&#8217;s regard for suffering is personal, not detached.<p>When we hurt, the enemy whispers that God must be disgusted with our weakness.

David insists that the faithful sufferer has not been abandoned.<p>&#8226; Job wrestled with the fear of a hidden face (<a href="/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a>) yet ultimately confessed, &#8220;My Redeemer lives&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when Christ quoted <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> from the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), the Father&#8217;s plan remained intact; the resurrection proved He had not truly turned away (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24-27</a>).<p>So, in seasons when God seems silent, this verse reminds us that divine presence persists behind the veil of circumstance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But has attended to his cry for help</b><p>God not only notices but actively responds. The Hebrew idea is leaning in to listen.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> echoes, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, God says, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people...and I have heard their cry.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; own prayers &#8220;were heard because of His reverence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>), guaranteeing that our cries in Him reach the same attentive Father.<p>Practical implications:<p>- Bring every pain to God honestly; He welcomes it.<p>- Expect real intervention&#8212;whether comfort, wisdom, or deliverance&#8212;because He promises to act (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p>- Encourage others by reminding them that their groans register in heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-24.htm">Psalm 22:24</a> assures believers that God never scorns suffering, never withdraws His favor, and always bends down to hear.
