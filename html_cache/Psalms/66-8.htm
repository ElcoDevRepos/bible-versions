It reflects the universal scope of God's sovereignty and the inclusivity of His blessings. The psalmist invites all nations to acknowledge and bless God, which aligns with the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. This call to bless God is a recognition of His authority and goodness, and it anticipates the New Testament revelation where the Gospel is extended to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>let the sound of His praise be heard.</b><br>The emphasis on the sound of praise being heard suggests a public and communal expression of worship. In ancient Israel, worship was often a communal activity, involving singing, music, and sometimes dancing, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. The sound of praise signifies not only the act of worship but also the testimony of God's deeds to others. This public declaration of God's greatness is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to proclaim the excellencies of God (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The phrase also implies that worship is not a silent or private affair but one that should be evident and audible, serving as a witness to God's glory and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, deserving of blessing and praise from all peoples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples.htm">Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to all nations and groups of people, indicating the universal call to worship and praise God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to David, who calls the people to worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of the psalm often reflects the experiences and worship practices of the nation of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/worship_gathering.htm">Worship Gathering</a></b><br>The event implied by the call for collective praise, suggesting a communal setting for worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call_to_worship.htm">Universal Call to Worship</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes that worship is not limited to a specific group but is a call to all peoples.

The people are called upon to praise God for a recent deliverance from a long period of severe affliction and oppression at the hand of enemies (vers. 8-12), and to join in the sacrifices which are about to be offered to God in payment of the vows made during the time of trouble (vers. 13-15).
