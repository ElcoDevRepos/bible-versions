In the context of <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a>, "them" refers to figures like Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, who interceded for Israel (<a href="/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>). This highlights God's faithfulness in responding to the cries of His chosen leaders. The historical context includes the wilderness period and the establishment of Israel's priesthood, where God frequently communicated His will and guidance. This responsiveness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>, where God answers Samuel's plea for Israel. It also foreshadows the New Testament assurance in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a> that God hears and answers prayers according to His will.<p><b>You were a forgiving God to them,</b><br>This phrase underscores God's mercy and willingness to forgive the sins of His people. The historical context includes numerous instances where Israel sinned, yet God showed mercy, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the rebellion at Kadesh (Numbers 14). Forgiveness is a central theme throughout the Bible, pointing to the ultimate forgiveness offered through Jesus Christ. The sacrificial system in the Old Testament, particularly the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), prefigures Christ's atoning sacrifice, which provides complete forgiveness for believers (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). This phrase reassures believers of God's enduring grace and readiness to forgive when they repent.<p><b>yet an avenger of their misdeeds.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's justice and the consequences of sin. While God is forgiving, He is also righteous and must address wrongdoing. The historical context includes instances where God disciplined Israel for their disobedience, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12) and the Babylonian exile (2 Kings 25). This duality of forgiveness and justice is seen throughout scripture, emphasizing that God's holiness requires Him to address sin. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Christ, who bore the penalty for sin, satisfying God's justice (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance, while also pointing to the hope of redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both forgiving and just.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses,_aaron,_and_samuel.htm">Moses, Aaron, and Samuel (implied context)</a></b><br>These leaders are mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a> as those who called upon the LORD and were answered by Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often the recipient of His forgiveness and discipline.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle/temple.htm">The Tabernacle/Temple (implied context)</a></b><br>The place where God&#8217;s presence dwelt and where the leaders interceded for the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness (implied context)</a></b><br>A significant period in Israel's history where God&#8217;s forgiveness and justice were evident.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_dual_nature.htm">God&#8217;s Dual Nature</a></b><br>God is both forgiving and just.
