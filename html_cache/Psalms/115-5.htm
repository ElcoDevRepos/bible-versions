Idols were often crafted with human features, including mouths, to symbolize communication with the divine. However, the psalmist emphasizes their inability to speak, contrasting them with the living God who communicates with His people (<a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20:1-3</a>). This critique of idolatry is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-20</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>, where the prophets mock the lifelessness of idols. The inability to speak also underscores the impotence of idols in providing guidance or wisdom, unlike the Word of God, which is living and active (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><b>they have eyes, but cannot see;</b><br>The depiction of idols with eyes that cannot see further illustrates their powerlessness. In the ancient world, eyes were often associated with knowledge and perception. The psalmist's critique points to the inability of idols to perceive or understand the needs of their worshippers. This is in stark contrast to the God of Israel, who is described as all-seeing and all-knowing (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). The theme of divine sight is significant throughout scripture, as God is portrayed as one who watches over His people and sees their afflictions (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The inability of idols to see also prefigures the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the Light of the World and brings true sight to the spiritually blind (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another Israelite leader, who is addressing the futility of idol worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The central subject of this verse, representing man-made objects of worship that are lifeless and powerless.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is directed, encouraging them to trust in the living God rather than in idols.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding cultures that worshipped idols, contrasting with Israel's worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh</a></b><br>The living God of Israel, who is contrasted with the lifeless idols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, though crafted with human skill, are ultimately powerless and cannot fulfill the needs of those who worship them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_god_vs._lifeless_idols.htm">The Living God vs. Lifeless Idols</a></b><br>Unlike idols, God is living and active, capable of hearing and responding to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_alone.htm">Trust in God Alone</a></b><br>Believers are called to place their trust in God, who is sovereign and able to act, rather than in man-made objects or concepts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/modern_idolatry.htm">Modern Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry today may not involve physical idols but can include anything that takes the place of God in our lives, such as money, power, or status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to discern what they are placing their trust in and to ensure it aligns with the truth of God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_115_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 115:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_115_5_Idol_worship_s_futility.htm">How does Psalm 115:5 highlight the futility of idol worship today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_do_silent_mouths_teach_on_false_gods.htm">What does "they have mouths, but cannot speak" teach about false gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_115_5_Insights_on_God_s_nature.htm">How can Psalm 115:5 deepen our understanding of God's living nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_115_5_Exodus_20_3-4_on_idols.htm">Connect Psalm 115:5 with Exodus 20:3-4 on idolatry's prohibition.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Psalm_115_5_to_avoid_idolatry.htm">How can we apply Psalm 115:5 to avoid modern-day idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_115_5_Idols_power_challenged.htm">How does Psalm 115:5 challenge the belief in idols having power or influence?

Yet every carved grin or solemn frown is nothing more than wood, metal, or stone fashioned by human hands (<a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-17</a>). By stressing the mouth, Scripture highlights how true relationship begins&#8212;through words. Think of God in <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: &#8220;And God said&#8230;&#8221; His speech brings light, order, and life. Idols, though shaped with mouths, stand mute.

The inability to speak means idols cannot reveal truth, forgive sin, or direct a single step&#8212;leaving devotees to grope in spiritual darkness (<a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have eyes</b><p>The psalmist shifts to visual language: &#8220;They have eyes&#8230;&#8221; Again, idols are sculpted with attention to detail&#8212;painted pupils, inlaid jewels&#8212;to suggest watchfulness. Human hearts long to be seen, known, and protected, so craftsmen design deities that appear perceptive. Yet this artistry only mirrors human imagination; it never becomes actual sight. <a href="/jeremiah/10-4.htm">Jeremiah 10:4-5</a> points out that idols must be fastened so they do not totter&#8212;hardly the posture of an all-seeing guardian.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But cannot see</b><p>Here lies the tragedy: &#8220;&#8230;but cannot see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> celebrates the living God whose &#8220;eyes are on the righteous.&#8221; Idols offer no such attentive gaze.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a> declares, &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him.&#8221; Idols remain blind to suffering, injustice, or repentance.<p>&#8226; Jesus, the exact imprint of God&#8217;s nature, &#8220;saw&#8221; Zacchaeus in a sycamore and Bartimaeus by the road (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>; <a href="/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a>). By contrast, an idol fixed on a shelf observes nothing, discerns nothing, rescues no one.<p>The psalmist&#8217;s point is sharp: worshipers inevitably become like what they worship (<a href="/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a>).
