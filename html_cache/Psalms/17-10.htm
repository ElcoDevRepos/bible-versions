In biblical terms, the heart is often seen as the center of one's will and emotions. A "callous heart" indicates insensitivity to God's guidance and moral truth. This hardening can be compared to Pharaoh's heart in Exodus, where repeated rejection of God's commands led to increased stubbornness. The closing of the heart is a conscious choice to reject divine wisdom and compassion, leading to spiritual blindness. This condition is warned against in <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a>, which states, "Blessed is the one who always trembles before God, but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble."<p><b>their mouths speak with arrogance.</b><br>Arrogance in speech reflects a deeper issue of pride and self-reliance, which is condemned throughout the Bible. The mouth, as an expression of the heart's condition, reveals the inner character of a person. Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>, "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of." Arrogant speech is often associated with a lack of humility and a disregard for others, which is contrary to the biblical call to love and serve one another. This behavior is reminiscent of the prideful speech of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, where the wicked, in their haughtiness, do not seek God. The New Testament also warns against such behavior in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>, where the tongue is described as a small part of the body that can cause great harm, likened to a fire that can set a forest ablaze.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>, David is praying for protection and deliverance from his enemies.
