The psalmist affirms God's rule, which predates human history, emphasizing His unchanging nature and authority. This echoes the biblical narrative of God's kingship seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where God is recognized as the ultimate ruler over Israel and the universe. The term "ancient times" suggests a connection to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God establishes His dominion over the earth. It also reflects the cultural understanding of kingship in ancient Near Eastern societies, where a king was seen as a divine representative on earth.<p><b>working salvation on the earth</b><br>This phrase highlights God's active role in delivering and redeeming His people. The concept of salvation is central to the biblical narrative, with God repeatedly intervening to rescue Israel from oppression, as seen in the Exodus story (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The phrase "on the earth" underscores the tangible and historical nature of God's saving acts, contrasting with purely spiritual or otherworldly salvation. This anticipates the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's redemptive work, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and realized in the New Testament (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>). The psalmist's declaration serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power to save throughout history, providing hope and assurance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, recognized as the eternal King and the source of salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The act of delivering or saving, which God is actively working on the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The realm where God's salvation is being enacted, highlighting His involvement in the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_sovereignty.htm">God's Eternal Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's kingship is not a new development but has been established "from of old."
