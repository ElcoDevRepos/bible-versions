In the context of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, traditionally attributed to David, it echoes the king's frequent calls for divine assistance during times of distress. Theologically, this cry can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own sense of abandonment on the cross, as He quotes the opening of this psalm in <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>. The phrase underscores the intimate relationship between the psalmist and God, emphasizing the need for God's proximity in times of trial.<p><b>for trouble is near</b><br>The psalmist acknowledges the immediacy and proximity of danger. Historically, David faced numerous adversities, including threats from Saul and surrounding nations. This phrase captures the essence of human vulnerability and the ever-present nature of spiritual and physical threats. In a broader biblical context, it resonates with the trials faced by believers, reminding them of the constant need for God's protection. The nearness of trouble contrasts with the desired nearness of God, highlighting the tension between divine presence and human peril.<p><b>and there is no one to help</b><br>This statement reflects a profound sense of isolation and helplessness. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and kinship were vital for support and survival. The absence of human aid intensifies the psalmist's reliance on God as the sole source of deliverance. This sentiment is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus, during His crucifixion, experiences abandonment by His disciples and the Father (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the ultimate dependence on God when earthly support fails, pointing to the sufficiency of divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, speaks literally of his need for God&#8217;s presence in a moment of distress, modeling the believer&#8217;s own dependence.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly assures us that God&#8217;s covenant people can appeal to His nearness: &#8220;You heard my plea: &#8216;Do not hide Your ear from my cry for relief&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>); &#8220;O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; For the follower of Christ, the New Testament echoes this confidence: &#8220;Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>), reflecting God&#8217;s unchanging character first revealed in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>.<p>&#8226; Personal application: whatever the circumstance&#8212;illness, relational strain, financial pressure&#8212;the correct instinct is to call on God&#8217;s promised presence rather than assume He is distant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for trouble is near</b><p>&#8226; David does not downplay the reality of his danger; instead, he links God&#8217;s closeness to the immediacy of his crisis. This honesty of heart is seen elsewhere: &#8220;For I hear the whispering of many; terror is on every side&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetically, <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> points ahead to Christ&#8217;s suffering. On the cross Jesus experienced &#8220;trouble&#8221; at its peak, fulfilling this psalm (cf. <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, trials may feel sudden and overwhelming. Yet Scripture confirms that God&#8217;s help is likewise immediate: &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: acknowledge the nearness of your trouble; then, with greater conviction, affirm the even greater nearness of your God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is no one to help</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s isolation is real: friends cannot rescue, armies cannot save. He echoes this elsewhere: &#8220;Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me&#8230; no one cares for my soul&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah foresaw a similar scene in Messiah&#8217;s suffering: &#8220;I looked, but there was no one to help&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>). At Gethsemane and Calvary the disciples &#8220;all left Him and fled&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>), leaving Jesus to bear sin&#8217;s weight alone.<p>&#8226; When earthly supports fail, God remains. Paul testified, &#8220;At my first defense no one came to my support&#8230; But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal reflection: the moments we feel abandoned often become the clearest stages for God to display His sufficiency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a> is a threefold plea that moves from a request for God&#8217;s nearness, to an acknowledgment of present danger, to the stark confession of human helplessness. Literally true for David and ultimately fulfilled in Christ, it invites every believer to turn first to the Lord when trouble rushes in and human aid disappears. In that turning we discover the unbreakable promise: God is never far from those who call upon Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not far from me</span>.
