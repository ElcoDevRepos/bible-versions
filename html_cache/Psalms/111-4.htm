Throughout the Bible, God commands His people to remember His works, such as the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, which commemorates the deliverance from Egypt. The act of remembering is crucial in maintaining faith and obedience. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, the Israelites are warned not to forget the LORD who brought them out of slavery. The wonders of God, such as creation, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision in the wilderness, serve as a testament to His power and faithfulness. These acts are often memorialized through festivals, altars, and oral traditions, ensuring that each generation acknowledges God's sovereignty and benevolence.<p><b>the LORD is gracious and compassionate.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes two of God's key attributes: grace and compassion. The Hebrew words for "gracious" (&#1495;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, channun) and "compassionate" (&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, rachum) are often used to describe God's character, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God reveals Himself to Moses. These attributes are central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, demonstrating His willingness to forgive and His deep love for humanity. In the New Testament, these qualities are embodied in Jesus Christ, who is described as full of grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The compassion of the LORD is evident in His dealings with Israel, His provision for the needy, and His ultimate plan of salvation through Christ. This phrase reassures believers of God's enduring mercy and kindness, encouraging them to trust in His unfailing love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders (Hebrew: ??????????, niphla'ot)</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous acts and mighty deeds of God, which are designed to inspire awe and remembrance among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/remembrance.htm">Remembrance</a></b><br>The act of recalling God's mighty works, which serves to strengthen faith and encourage worship among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Remembering God's wonders is crucial for maintaining a vibrant faith.
