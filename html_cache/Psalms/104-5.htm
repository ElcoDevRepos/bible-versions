The imagery of setting the earth on foundations suggests stability and order, reflecting the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the cosmos as a structured and secure entity. In <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, God is depicted as the Creator who brings order out of chaos, establishing the earth as a place for life. The concept of foundations can also be seen in <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>, where God questions Job about the creation of the earth, highlighting His wisdom and authority. This phrase underscores the belief that the earth's stability is a direct result of God's intentional design and purpose.<p><b>never to be moved</b><br>This part of the verse assures the reader of the earth's permanence and reliability, rooted in God's unchanging nature. In the ancient world, the idea of an immovable earth provided a sense of security and trust in the Creator's ongoing governance. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, where the world is described as firmly established and unshakeable. Theologically, this reflects the belief in God's eternal covenant with creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/33-25.htm">Jeremiah 33:25</a>, where the fixed order of the cosmos is linked to God's faithfulness. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the cornerstone in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, symbolizing stability and the foundation of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of the universe, who establishes the earth on its foundations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The physical world created by God, symbolizing stability and order in creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foundations.htm">Foundations</a></b><br>Metaphorical representation of the earth's stability and permanence as ordained by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority who established the earth, reflecting His power and control over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stability_and_order.htm">Stability and Order</a></b><br>Understand that the earth's foundations symbolize the stability and order God has instituted, providing assurance in His unchanging nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_design.htm">Trust in God's Design</a></b><br>Trust in the intentional design and purpose God has for creation, knowing that He has set everything in place according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation_reflects_god's_glory.htm">Creation Reflects God's Glory</a></b><br>Appreciate the beauty and complexity of creation as a reflection of God's glory and majesty, leading to worship and reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_assurance.htm">Living with Assurance</a></b><br>Live with confidence and assurance in God's promises, knowing that just as the earth is immovable, so are His plans and purposes for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_104_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 104:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_5_God_s_rule_earth_s_stability.htm">How does Psalm 104:5 affirm God's sovereignty in creation and the earth's stability?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_He_made_earth_show_of_God.htm">What does "He established the earth" reveal about God's power and authority?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_5_and_Genesis_1_1_link.htm">How does Psalm 104:5 connect with Genesis 1:1 on creation's foundation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_trust_God_s_control_today.htm">In what ways can we trust God's control over the world's stability today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Psalm_104_5_on_stewardship.htm">How should Psalm 104:5 influence our stewardship of God's creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_104_5_vs_Earth_s_foundations.htm">How does Psalm 104:5 align with scientific understanding of Earth's foundations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Earth_s_immovability_literal_or_metaphorical.htm">Does Psalm 104:5 imply a literal or metaphorical interpretation of Earth's immovability?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_104_5.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 104:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_104.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 104?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_earth_'unmoved'_if_it_orbits.htm">How can the earth be &#8220;set on its foundations, never to be moved&#8221; (Psalm 104:5) if our planet orbits the sun and moves through space? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/will_earth_endure_eternally.htm">Will the earth last forever?
