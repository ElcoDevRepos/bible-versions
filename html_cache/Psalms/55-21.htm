In biblical times, butter was a luxury, symbolizing richness and smoothness. The imagery suggests a facade of kindness and gentleness. This can be compared to <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>, where the lips of an adulterous woman drip honey, indicating deceit. The smooth speech is a tool for manipulation, reminiscent of the serpent's words to Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, which were cunning and misleading.<p><b>but war is in his heart</b><br>Despite the outward appearance of peace, the true intention is conflict. This reflects the biblical theme of the heart's deceitfulness, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which states that the heart is deceitful above all things. The contrast between outward speech and inward intent is a warning against trusting appearances. Historically, this can be seen in the actions of figures like Absalom, who spoke kindly to win the hearts of the people while plotting rebellion against his father, King David (2 Samuel 15).<p><b>His words are softer than oil</b><br>Oil in the ancient Near East was used for anointing and healing, symbolizing smoothness and comfort. The comparison suggests that the words are meant to soothe and placate. However, this softness is a guise, much like the flattering lips mentioned in <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>, which hide true intentions. The use of oil also connects to the anointing of kings and priests, indicating a false sense of authority or blessing.<p><b>yet they are swords unsheathed</b><br>The imagery of swords unsheathed reveals the true danger behind the words. In biblical literature, swords often symbolize judgment and warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where the Word of God is described as the sword of the Spirit. The unsheathing of swords indicates readiness for battle, suggesting that the speaker's words, though seemingly gentle, are prepared to cause harm. This duality is a reminder of the spiritual warfare believers face, where discernment is necessary to recognize the true nature of seemingly benign influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his anguish over betrayal by a close companion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of many of David's psalms, often representing a place of both divine presence and human conflict.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/betrayal.htm">Betrayal</a></b><br>The central event in this psalm, where David feels deceived by someone he trusted, reflecting a broader theme of treachery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose David, often characterized by deceitful and malicious intentions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate refuge and source of justice for David amidst his trials.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_words.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Words</a></b><br>Words can be used to manipulate and deceive, appearing gentle while hiding harmful intentions.

While words may flow like butter or oil&#8212;smooth, soft, and reassuring&#8212;the true intention can be warfare, with sentences acting like unsheathed swords. Scripture repeatedly warns that outward niceness is no guarantee of inward righteousness. Discernment comes from measuring every word and motive against the unchanging truth of God&#8217;s Word, trusting Him to reveal what lies beneath the surface.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/55.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The words of his mouth.</span>--The ancient versions and the grammatical anomalies point to a corruption of the text.
