In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kissing was a gesture of respect and allegiance to a sovereign. The "Son" here is understood as a reference to the Messiah, a royal figure with divine authority. This aligns with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, deserving of worship and allegiance (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>).<p><b>Lest He be angry</b><br>The warning of divine anger reflects the biblical theme of God's righteous judgment against sin and rebellion. God's anger is not capricious but is a response to human defiance against His sovereign rule. This echoes the Old Testament understanding of God as a just judge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>).<p><b>And you perish in your rebellion</b><br>Rebellion against God leads to destruction, a consistent biblical theme. The Hebrew word for "perish" often implies a complete and irreversible ruin. This serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's authority, paralleling the fate of those who oppose God's anointed in other scriptures (<a href="/proverbs/29.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>).<p><b>When His wrath ignites in an instant</b><br>The suddenness of God's wrath emphasizes the urgency of repentance and submission. This reflects the biblical teaching that God's judgment can come unexpectedly, urging readiness and vigilance (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>).<p><b>Blessed are all who take refuge in Him</b><br>The promise of blessing for those who seek refuge in God highlights His role as a protector and savior. This is a recurring theme in the Psalms, where God is depicted as a fortress and shield for those who trust in Him (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/91-2.htm">Psalm 91:2</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation through faith in Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Refers to the anointed King, understood in Christian theology as Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

It has against it the weight of all the ancient versions except the Syriac. Thus the Chaldaic has, "receive instruction "; LXX., followed by Vulg., "lay hold of discipline." Symmachus and Jerome render "pay pure adoration."Aquila has "kiss with discernment." <span class= "ital">Bar, </span>in the sense of "son," is common in Chaldee, and is familiar to us from the Aramaic patronymics of the New Testament: <span class= "ital">e.g., Bar-Jonas, Bar-nabas, </span>&c. The only place where it occurs in Heb., is <a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm" title="What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?">Proverbs 31:2</a>, where it is repeated three times; but the Book of Proverbs has a great deal of Aramaic colouring. Our psalmist uses <span class= "ital">ben </span>for "son" in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>, and it is unlikely that he would change to so unusual a term, unless <span class= "ital">nashshek--bar were </span>a proverbial saying, and of this there is no proof Surely, too, the article or a suffix would have been employed. "Kiss son" seems altogether too abrupt and bald even for Hebrew poetry. The change of subject also in the co-ordinate clause, "lest he (<span class= "ital">i.e., Jehovah, </span>as the context shows) be angry," is very awkward. As to the translation of the verb, the remark of Delitzsch, that it means "to kiss, and nothing else," is wide of the mark, since it must in any case be taken <span class= "ital">figuratively, </span>with sense of <span class= "ital">doing homage, </span>as in <a href="/genesis/41-40.htm" title="You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.">Genesis 41:40</a> (margin), or <span class= "ital">worshipping </span>(<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm" title="Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.">1Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm" title="And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.">Hosea 13:2</a>). The most consistent rendering is, therefore, <span class= "ital">proffer pure homage </span>(to Jehovah), <span class= "ital">lest he be angry. </span>It may be added that the current of Rabbinical authority is against our Authorised version. Thus R. Solomon: "Arm yourselves with discipline;" (so, with a slight variation, one of the latest commentators, E. Reuss: "Arm yourselves with loyalty";) another Rabbi: "Kiss the covenant"; another, "Adore the corn." Among the best of modern scholars, Hupfeld renders "yield sincerely"; Ewald, "receive wholesome warning"; Hitzig, "submit to duty"; Gratz (by emendation), "give good heed to the warning."<p><span class= "bld">From the way.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg. amplify and explain "from the righteous way." It is the way in following which, whether for individuals or nations, alone there is peace and happiness. (See <span class= "ital">Note </span><a href="/psalms/119-1.htm" title="Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.">Psalm 119:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kiss the Son</span>. It is certainly remarkable that we have here a different word for "Son" from that employed in ver. 7, and ordinarily in the Hebrew Bible. Still, there is other evidence that the word here used, <span class="accented">bar</span>, existed in the Hebrew no less than in the Aramaic, viz. <a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, where it is repeated thrice. It was probably an archaic and poetic word, like our "sire" for "father," rarely used, but, when used, intended to mark some special dignity. Hengstenberg suggests that the writer's motive in prefering <span class="accented">bar to ben</span> in this place was to avoid the cacophony which would have arisen from the juxtaposition of <span class="accented">ben</span> and pen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>); and this is quite possible, but as a secondary rather than as the main reason. By "<span class="accented">kiss</span> the Son" we must understand "pay him homage," salute him as King in the customary way (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he be angry</span>. The omission of a customary token of respect is an insult which naturally augers the object of it (<a href="/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye perish from the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">as to the way."</span> To anger the Son is to bring destruction on our "way," or course in life. <span class="cmt_word">When his wrath is kindled but a little</span>; rather, for soon <span class="accented">his wrath may be kindled</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are all they that put their trust in him</span>. The writer ends with words of blessing, to relieve the general severity of the psalm (comp. <a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>, etc.).
