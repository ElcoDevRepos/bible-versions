In the context of <a href="/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is lamenting a betrayal by someone close to him. This reflects the broader biblical theme of betrayal, seen in stories like that of Joseph and his brothers (Genesis 37) and Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The personal nature of the betrayal underscores the intensity of David's anguish.<p><b>a man like myself</b><br>The phrase suggests equality and shared experiences, emphasizing the closeness of the relationship. In ancient Israelite society, friendships were often formed through shared life experiences and mutual respect. This phrase implies that the betrayer was not just an acquaintance but someone who shared a similar status and life journey with David, making the betrayal more poignant. This can be compared to Jesus' relationship with His disciples, who were His companions and shared in His ministry.<p><b>my companion</b><br>The term "companion" indicates a trusted associate or confidant. In biblical times, companionship was a significant bond, often involving shared meals, travels, and counsel. This betrayal by a companion is reminiscent of Ahithophel's betrayal of David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), where a trusted advisor turned against him. It also foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, who was one of His twelve disciples and shared in His ministry.<p><b>and close friend</b><br>The phrase "close friend" denotes an intimate relationship, suggesting deep trust and affection. In the cultural context of the Bible, friendship was a covenantal relationship, often involving loyalty and mutual support. The betrayal by a close friend is particularly painful, as it breaks the bonds of trust and loyalty. This mirrors the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, who was not only a disciple but also someone who shared in the Last Supper, symbolizing deep fellowship (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his anguish over betrayal by a close friend. This psalm is a lament, reflecting a personal and painful experience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_betrayer.htm">The Betrayer</a></b><br>While not named in the text, this person is described as a close friend and companion of David. Some scholars suggest this could be Ahithophel, David's counselor who betrayed him during Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of many of David's psalms, including this one, is often Jerusalem, the city of David, which holds significant historical and spiritual importance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>An event in David's life where his son Absalom led a rebellion against him, during which Ahithophel, David's counselor, betrayed him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to King David who later sided with Absalom during the rebellion, often associated with the betrayal mentioned in this psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_betrayal.htm">The Pain of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal by a close friend is deeply painful and personal.

This teaches us to seek God's presence and guidance when we face betrayal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_forgiveness.htm">The Importance of Forgiveness</a></b><br>While the psalm expresses hurt, the broader biblical account encourages forgiveness, as seen in Jesus' teachings.
