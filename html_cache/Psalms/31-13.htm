In biblical times, slander was a serious offense, often leading to social ostracism or legal consequences. The psalmist, traditionally believed to be David, frequently faced slander from his enemies, including King Saul and others who opposed his rule. This experience of slander is echoed in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also falsely accused by religious leaders (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>). The theme of enduring slander and trusting in God for vindication is a recurring motif in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2-3</a>).<p><b>there is terror on every side.</b><br>This expression conveys a sense of being surrounded by danger and fear. The phrase "terror on every side" is used multiple times in the Old Testament, often in contexts of impending judgment or warfare (<a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25, 20</a>:3). It suggests a situation where the psalmist feels besieged by threats, both physical and emotional. Historically, David faced numerous threats from surrounding nations and internal rebellion, which could have inspired such imagery. This phrase also resonates with the trials faced by believers who feel overwhelmed by the challenges and hostilities of the world.<p><b>They conspire against me</b><br>Conspiracy against the psalmist indicates a deliberate and coordinated effort by enemies to harm him. In David's life, there were several instances of conspiracy, such as Absalom's rebellion (2 Samuel 15) and the betrayal by Ahithophel (<a href="/2_samuel/16-20.htm">2 Samuel 16:20-23</a>). The notion of conspiracy also points to the spiritual warfare believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the righteous being opposed by the wicked.<p><b>and plot to take my life.</b><br>The ultimate aim of the psalmist's enemies is to destroy him, which underscores the severity of the threat. In the historical context, David's life was often in danger, whether from Saul's attempts to kill him (<a href="/1_samuel/19.htm">1 Samuel 19:1-2</a>) or from other adversaries. This phrase foreshadows the plot against Jesus Christ, whose life was sought by those who opposed His ministry (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). The psalmist's plea for deliverance from such plots is a testament to his reliance on God's protection and justice, a theme that is central to the message of the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking refuge in God amidst his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies/adversaries.htm">Enemies/Adversaries</a></b><br>The unspecified individuals or groups who are slandering and conspiring against David, creating a sense of terror.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/terror_on_every_side.htm">Terror on Every Side</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the overwhelming nature of the threats and fears surrounding David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/conspiracy.htm">Conspiracy</a></b><br>The organized effort by David's enemies to harm him, reflecting the intense opposition he faced.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plot_to_take_my_life.htm">Plot to Take My Life</a></b><br>The ultimate threat against David, highlighting the severity of his situation and his reliance on God for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite the overwhelming threats, believers are encouraged to trust in God's ability to protect and deliver them from their enemies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_opposition.htm">The Reality of Opposition</a></b><br>Followers of God should be prepared for opposition and slander, understanding that these challenges are part of the spiritual journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_refuge.htm">Prayer as a Refuge</a></b><br>In times of distress, turning to God in prayer is a powerful way to find peace and strength amidst adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_plots.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Plots</a></b><br>No matter how well-organized the plans against us may be, God's sovereignty ensures that His purposes will prevail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_through_trials.htm">Endurance Through Trials</a></b><br>The experiences of biblical figures like David and Jesus remind us that enduring trials with faith can lead to spiritual growth and deeper reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_31_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 31:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_31_13_Trust_God_in_adversity.htm">How does Psalm 31:13 encourage trust in God during times of adversity?
