The imagery of twisting oaks suggests a force capable of altering the natural world, reflecting God's sovereignty over creation. Oaks, known for their strength and durability, symbolize stability and endurance. The ability of God's voice to twist them highlights His supreme power. This can be connected to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God's voice brings the universe into existence. It also echoes the power of Jesus' words in the New Testament, such as when He calms the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.<p><b>and strips the forests bare.</b><br>The stripping of forests signifies complete transformation and the overwhelming impact of God's presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, forests were often seen as places of mystery and divine presence. The imagery here may also evoke the idea of judgment, where nothing can withstand the purifying and revealing power of God. This can be linked to prophetic imagery in <a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>, where the LORD's judgment is described as cutting down the forest thickets with an ax. It underscores the theme of God's ultimate authority over all creation.<p><b>And in His temple all cry, &#8220;Glory!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase shifts the focus from the natural world to the spiritual realm, highlighting the response of worship and reverence to God's majesty. The temple represents God's dwelling place among His people, a central theme in the Old Testament. The cry of "Glory!" signifies recognition of God's holiness and splendor. This response is mirrored in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8-11</a>, where heavenly beings continually worship God, proclaiming His glory. The temple can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God's presence, as described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. The collective cry of "Glory!" reflects the unity and awe of God's people in response to His divine power and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this Psalm, whose powerful voice is described as having the ability to affect nature profoundly.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oaks_and_forests.htm">Oaks and Forests</a></b><br>Natural elements that symbolize strength and stability, yet are subject to the power of God's voice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>Represents the place of worship where God's glory is acknowledged and praised by His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_voice.htm">The Power of God's Voice</a></b><br>God's voice is not only creative but also transformative, affecting the natural world and human hearts alike.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/nature's_response_to_god.htm">Nature's Response to God</a></b><br>The imagery of oaks twisting and forests being stripped bare serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_in_response_to_god's_glory.htm">Worship in Response to God's Glory</a></b><br>The appropriate response to witnessing God's power is worship, as seen in the temple where all cry, "Glory!"<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_worship.htm">God's Presence in Worship</a></b><br>The temple signifies God's dwelling place among His people, where His presence is acknowledged and revered.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_majesty.htm">Reverence for God's Majesty</a></b><br>Recognizing the majesty of God should lead to a life of reverence and awe, influencing our daily walk with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_29_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 29:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_29_9_God_s_power_in_nature.htm">How does Psalm 29:9 reveal God's power over creation and nature?

And Pliny, "Solitary sheep cast their lambs in thunderstorms; the remedy is to keep the flock together, since it helps them to have company." A traveller in South Africa observes, "In Bechuanaland, when there are heavy thunderstorms, the antelopes flee in consternation; and the poor Bechuanas start off on the morning following such a storm in quest of the young which have been cast through horror" (see Moffat's 'South Africa,' quoted by Dr. Kay, in his 'Commentary on the Psalms,' p. 93). <span class="cmt_word">And discovereth the forests</span>; or, <span class="accented">strippeth the forests.</span> Denudes them of their leaves and branches. <span class="cmt_word">And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his grand temple, or palace (<span class="accented">heykal</span>), of heaven and earth. In this temple "every one," or rather <span class="accented">everything</span>, all that is in it. is continually speaking of his glory (literally, "says, Glory!"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/29-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The voice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6963.htm">Strong's 6963: </a> </span><span class="str2">A voice, sound</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;
