In the context of ancient Israel, the people often faced external threats from surrounding nations, and their reliance on God for military and spiritual strength was crucial. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, where God is described as a rock and fortress. The idea of God as strength is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to be strong in the Lord (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>). This strength is not merely physical but encompasses spiritual resilience and moral fortitude.<p><b>a stronghold of salvation</b><br>The term "stronghold" refers to a fortified place of refuge and safety. In ancient times, strongholds were essential for protection against enemies. Spiritually, this indicates that God provides ultimate security and deliverance from sin and spiritual adversaries. The concept of salvation here is both immediate, in terms of deliverance from present troubles, and eschatological, pointing to eternal salvation. This dual aspect of salvation is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a> and <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where salvation is both a present reality and a future hope.<p><b>for His anointed</b><br>The term "anointed" traditionally refers to kings and priests in Israel, who were consecrated for their roles through anointing with oil. In a broader sense, it can refer to all of God's chosen people. Historically, King David, the author of many psalms, was anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), symbolizing God's selection and empowerment. Prophetically, this term points to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Anointed One (Christ means "Anointed One" in Greek). This connection is seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a> and <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, where Jesus fulfills the role of the anointed deliverer. The anointing signifies God's favor and the empowerment to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.
