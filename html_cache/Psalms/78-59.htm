Throughout <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, the psalmist recounts the history of Israel's rebellion and disobedience despite God's continuous provision and miracles. The "it" in this context includes the Israelites' idolatry, lack of faith, and repeated testing of God. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where God hears the cries, complaints, or sins of His people and responds accordingly. The concept of God hearing is significant, as it underscores His attentiveness to human actions and prayers, as seen in <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a> when God hears the groaning of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>God was furious</b><br>The anger of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often depicted as a response to sin and disobedience. God's fury is not arbitrary but is a righteous response to the covenant violations by His people. This divine anger is consistent with His holiness and justice. In <a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8</a>, Moses reminds the Israelites of how they provoked the Lord to wrath at Horeb. God's fury is also a demonstration of His love, as it seeks to correct and bring His people back to righteousness, similar to a father's discipline of his children (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><b>and rejected Israel completely</b><br>This phrase indicates a severe consequence of Israel's persistent rebellion. The rejection is not necessarily permanent but serves as a warning and a call to repentance. Historically, this rejection can be seen in events such as the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were removed from their land due to their unfaithfulness. Theologically, this rejection points to the seriousness of covenant unfaithfulness. However, it also foreshadows the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where the ultimate rejection and acceptance are fulfilled. In <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11:1-2</a>, Paul discusses how God has not rejected His people entirely, emphasizing the remnant chosen by grace. This rejection serves as a backdrop for the eventual inclusion of the Gentiles and the establishment of the Church, highlighting God's redemptive plan through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as being deeply displeased with Israel's actions.
