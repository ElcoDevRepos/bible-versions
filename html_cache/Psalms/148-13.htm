The "name of the LORD" signifies His character and authority. In biblical times, a name represented the essence of a person. The call to praise is a recurring theme in the Psalms, reflecting the Jewish tradition of worship and the acknowledgment of God's covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase connects to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which emphasizes the oneness and uniqueness of God.<p><b>for His name alone is exalted</b><br>This highlights the exclusivity of God's majesty and power. In a polytheistic ancient Near Eastern context, where many gods were worshiped, this statement affirms monotheism and the supremacy of Yahweh. The idea of God's name being exalted is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where Jesus is given the name above every name, showing a continuity in the exaltation of God's name through Christ.<p><b>His splendor is above the earth and the heavens</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's transcendence and the glory of His creation. The heavens and the earth are often used in Scripture to denote the entirety of creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. God's splendor surpasses all that is visible, indicating His infinite nature. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>, where God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours, and it points to the majesty of God that is fully revealed in Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where Christ is the agent of creation and sustainer of all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, whose name is to be praised and exalted above all.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth_and_the_heavens.htm">The Earth and the Heavens</a></b><br>These are the realms over which God's splendor is declared to be supreme, emphasizing His sovereignty and majesty over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_uniqueness_of_god's_name.htm">The Uniqueness of God's Name</a></b><br>God's name is not just a label but a representation of His character and authority.

Believers are encouraged to join in this universal chorus, recognizing that worship is not limited to a specific time or place but is a continual act of acknowledging God's greatness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>The mention of God's splendor being above the earth and heavens serves as a reminder of His ultimate authority and control over all things.
