It suggests a period where God seemed inactive or distant, which is a common motif in the Psalms when Israel faces distress or judgment. The imagery of God "awakening" signifies a decisive moment of divine action and deliverance. This can be connected to other instances in Scripture where God "awakens" to act on behalf of His people, such as in <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>. Theologically, it emphasizes God's sovereignty and timing, reminding believers that God's apparent silence is not indicative of His absence or indifference.<p><b>like a mighty warrior</b><br>The depiction of God as a warrior is prevalent throughout the Old Testament, highlighting His power and ability to protect and deliver His people. This imagery is rooted in the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where gods were often portrayed as warriors. In <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, God is called a "man of war" after the deliverance at the Red Sea. This warrior motif is also a type of Christ, who is seen as the ultimate divine warrior in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where He returns to defeat evil and establish His kingdom.<p><b>overcome by wine</b><br>This phrase uses hyperbolic language to describe the intensity and suddenness of God's action. In the ancient world, a warrior overcome by wine would be unexpected and unpredictable, suggesting that God's intervention is both powerful and surprising. While God is never literally overcome by anything, this metaphor serves to illustrate the dramatic shift from perceived inactivity to decisive action. It underscores the idea that God's ways and timing are beyond human understanding, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>. This imagery also contrasts with the sobriety and vigilance expected of God's people, as admonished in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as the divine warrior who intervenes on behalf of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_warrior.htm">Mighty Warrior</a></b><br>A metaphor for God, emphasizing His strength and readiness to act decisively.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sleep.htm">Sleep</a></b><br>A metaphorical state indicating a period of divine inaction or perceived absence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wine.htm">Wine</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the suddenness and vigor of God's awakening and action.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Timing and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's "awakening" is a metaphor for His perfect timing.
