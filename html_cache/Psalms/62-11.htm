In biblical context, when God speaks, it is definitive and requires no repetition for validation. This reflects the creation narrative in Genesis, where God speaks the world into existence with authority. The singularity of God's speech underscores His sovereignty and the sufficiency of His revelation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the word of a king or deity was considered powerful and binding, and this is magnified in the case of the God of Israel, whose word is ultimate truth.<p><b>I have heard this twice:</b><br>The repetition here signifies certainty and importance. In Hebrew literature, repetition is a common device to emphasize a point. This mirrors the practice in the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where repetition is used to ensure understanding and retention. The phrase suggests that the psalmist has internalized the message, indicating a deep, personal conviction. It also reflects the Jewish tradition of oral transmission, where hearing and repeating were key to learning and preserving God's word.<p><b>that power belongs to God,</b><br>This declaration affirms God's omnipotence, a central theme throughout Scripture. It connects to other biblical passages such as <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>, which speak of God's unmatched strength and ability to accomplish His purposes. In the historical context, Israel often faced powerful enemies, and this truth served as a reminder of God's ultimate control over all nations and events. Theologically, it points to God's role as the ultimate ruler and judge, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the authority of Jesus Christ, who is described as having all power in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). This phrase reassures believers of God's ability to protect and deliver, reinforcing trust in His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his psalms of worship and lament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His sovereignty and omnipotence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalms were originally addressed, often facing challenges that required reliance on God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unchanging_nature_of_god's_power.htm">The Unchanging Nature of God's Power</a></b><br>God's power is constant and unchanging, a truth that provides stability and assurance in a world of uncertainty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>The repetition in the verse ("God has spoken once; I have heard this twice") highlights the importance of attentively listening to God's voice and recognizing His authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_divine_strength.htm">Reliance on Divine Strength</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to rely on God's power rather than their own strength, especially in times of trouble or weakness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_our_lives.htm">God's Sovereignty in Our Lives</a></b><br>Understanding that power belongs to God helps us to trust in His plans and purposes, even when they are beyond our understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_worship_and_reverence.htm">The Call to Worship and Reverence</a></b><br>Recognizing God's power should lead us to worship Him with reverence and awe, acknowledging His supreme authority over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_62_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 62:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_11_God_s_power_in_daily_life.htm">How does Psalm 62:11 emphasize God's power in your daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_power_is_God_s_teach.htm">What does "power belongs to God" teach about His sovereignty?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_power_in_challenges.htm">How can you trust God's power during personal challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_62_11_to_Isaiah_40_29.htm">Connect Psalm 62:11 with another verse highlighting God's strength.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_power_shape_your_worship.htm">How should God's power influence your prayer and worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_11_God_s_power_and_authority.htm">What does Psalm 62:11 reveal about God's power and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_11_s_impact_on_divine_sovereignty.htm">How does Psalm 62:11 challenge our understanding of divine sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_repeat_God_has_spoken_in_Ps_62_11.htm">Why is the repetition of "God has spoken" significant in Psalm 62:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_62.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 62?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalm_62_and_eph._2_align.htm">In Psalm 62:11&#8211;12, God rewards each person according to their deeds&#8212;how does this harmonize with the New Testament&#8217;s teaching on salvation by grace (Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_black_people_under_a_curse.htm">What does 'Word will not return void' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_white_magic.htm">What defines white magic?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_peter_2_13-14_with_civil_disobedience.htm">1 Peter 2:13&#8211;14: How can we reconcile the instruction to submit to all human authorities with moral responsibility and examples of civil disobedience elsewhere in the Bible? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 62:11 Mean</div><b>God has spoken once</b><p>- David anchors everything on the certainty of God&#8217;s word. When the LORD declares something, it is settled (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>- Because His character is flawless, a single utterance is entirely sufficient. <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a> reminds us &#8220;it is impossible for God to lie,&#8221; so one statement from Him carries absolute authority.<p>- This opening phrase also contrasts human chatter with divine clarity; where people need to repeat and revise, God&#8217;s word stands fixed (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have heard this twice</b><p>- Hebrew poetry often uses repetition to underscore importance; the idea is that David has grasped the message so fully it echoes in his soul. <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a> notes that &#8220;God speaks in one way and in another,&#8221; urging us to pay attention.<p>- The phrase hints at personal experience: the psalmist not only read or heard doctrine, he internalized it. Like the Bereans who &#8220;received the word with great eagerness&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), David listens carefully.<p>- It also signals confirmation. By Mosaic law, &#8220;every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). Hearing it &#8220;twice&#8221; meets that standard: God&#8217;s power is beyond dispute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that power belongs to God</b><p>- Here is the truth God proclaims and David absorbs: all power&#8212;authority, strength, ability&#8212;resides in the LORD alone. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> echoes, &#8220;Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, the power and the glory.&#8221;<p>- In context, the psalm warns against trusting oppression or riches (<a href="/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9-10</a>). Only God is a reliable refuge; human strength is fleeting.<p>- The New Testament reaffirms this exclusive sovereignty: Jesus is seated &#8220;far above all rule and authority and power and dominion&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>). Even earthly rulers can act only as heaven permits (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>; <a href="/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>).<p>- For believers, this means:<p>&#8226; We rest, not in our resources, but in His omnipotence (<a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; We pray confidently, knowing He is able (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; We live humbly, remembering any strength we possess is delegated, not inherent (<a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God utters a single, sufficient word, and the attentive heart hears it again and again: &#8220;Power belongs to God.&#8221; Because His authority is unmatched and unchanging, we can abandon self-reliance, reject worldly props, and trust the Almighty who speaks once yet resonates forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/62.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Once; twice.</span>--The usual Hebrew mode of emphasising a numerical statement, and one growing naturally out of the structure of the verse, which loves a climax.
