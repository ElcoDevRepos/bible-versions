In the biblical context, the "brokenhearted" refers to individuals experiencing deep sorrow or distress. The Hebrew word for "brokenhearted" can imply a shattering or crushing of the heart, indicating profound grief. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is prophesied to "bind up the brokenhearted," highlighting a messianic role of healing and restoration. The nearness of the LORD suggests His intimate involvement and readiness to provide comfort and support. This is consistent with the character of God as depicted throughout the Bible, where He is portrayed as a refuge and strength, especially in times of trouble (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>He saves the contrite in spirit.</b><br>The term "contrite" refers to a deep sense of remorse and humility before God. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, contrition was often associated with repentance and a turning back to God. The "spirit" here denotes the inner being or the essence of a person. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of salvation being extended to those who recognize their need for God and approach Him with humility. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, where God dwells with the contrite and lowly in spirit, reinforces the idea that God values a humble heart. This humility and recognition of one's need for divine intervention are also seen in the teachings of Jesus, who blessed the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>), indicating that the kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are spiritually humble. The saving action of God towards the contrite is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He offers salvation to those who come to Him in repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after being delivered from a difficult situation with Abimelech.
