It echoes the biblical theme of God's infinite wisdom and knowledge, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a> and <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>. The act of counting suggests a deep engagement with God's creation and His works, emphasizing the vastness of God's presence and actions in the world.<p><b>they would outnumber the grains of sand;</b><br>The imagery of grains of sand is a common biblical metaphor for something immeasurable and vast, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, where God promises Abraham descendants as numerous as the sand on the seashore. This comparison highlights the boundless nature of God's thoughts and plans, suggesting that they are beyond human comprehension and more numerous than anything we can imagine.<p><b>and when I awake,</b><br>This phrase can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it suggests the psalmist's awareness of God's presence upon waking each day. Metaphorically, it can represent spiritual awakening or enlightenment, aligning with themes of renewal and resurrection found in passages like <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>. It underscores the continuity of God's presence in both the conscious and subconscious states.<p><b>I am still with You.</b><br>This final phrase affirms the enduring relationship between the psalmist and God. It suggests a sense of security and constancy, reminiscent of God's promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a> to never leave nor forsake His people. It also reflects the intimate relationship believers have with God through Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him. This assurance of God's perpetual presence provides comfort and strength to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, King David, is expressing his awe at God's omnipresence and omniscience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this Psalm, God is depicted as all-knowing and ever-present, intimately involved in the life of the believer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist's_reflection.htm">The Psalmist's Reflection</a></b><br>This event is a moment of personal reflection and worship, where the psalmist contemplates the vastness of God's thoughts and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_infinite_thoughts.htm">God's Infinite Thoughts</a></b><br>God's thoughts toward us are innumerable, reflecting His infinite wisdom and care.
