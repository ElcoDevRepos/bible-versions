Knowing God's name implies an intimate understanding of His nature and attributes. In <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, God reveals Himself as "I AM," signifying His eternal, self-existent nature. This knowledge of God's character fosters trust and reliance on Him. The name of God is a strong tower (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>), providing safety and security to those who understand and call upon it.<p><b>trust in You</b><br>Trust in God is a central theme throughout Scripture. It involves placing confidence in His promises and faithfulness. <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> emphasizes that faith is essential to please God, and trust is an expression of that faith. Trusting in God means relying on His wisdom and timing, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages believers to lean not on their own understanding but to acknowledge Him in all their ways.<p><b>for You, O LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals refers to the divine name YHWH, often pronounced as Yahweh. This covenant name of God is significant in the Old Testament, highlighting His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people. The LORD is depicted as a personal and relational God who is involved in the lives of His followers. This personal relationship is foundational to the trust mentioned earlier.<p><b>have not forsaken</b><br>The assurance that God does not forsake His people is a recurring promise in Scripture. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a> both affirm that God will never leave nor forsake His followers. This promise provides comfort and encouragement, especially during times of trial and adversity. God's faithfulness is unwavering, and His presence is constant, offering hope and strength.<p><b>those who seek You</b><br>Seeking God is an active pursuit, involving prayer, worship, and obedience. <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> promises that those who seek God with all their heart will find Him. This pursuit is not just about finding answers but about developing a deeper relationship with God. Jesus, in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, instructs believers to seek first the kingdom of God, emphasizing the priority of seeking Him above all else. Seeking God leads to spiritual growth and a closer walk with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart. He often expressed his trust in God through the Psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often the primary audience of the Psalms, who experienced God's faithfulness and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/k/knowing_god's_name.htm">Knowing God's Name</a></b><br>Understanding the significance of God's name involves recognizing His character and attributes. In Hebrew, "name" (shem) often represents the essence of a person. Knowing God's name means knowing His faithfulness, love, and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_as_a_response.htm">Trust as a Response</a></b><br>Trusting in God is a natural response to knowing His character. The Hebrew word for trust (batach) implies confidence and security. Believers are called to place their confidence in God's unchanging nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god.htm">Seeking God</a></b><br>Actively seeking God is a recurring theme in Scripture. It involves pursuing a relationship with Him through prayer, worship, and obedience. God promises not to forsake those who earnestly seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The assurance that God does not forsake His people is a cornerstone of faith.
