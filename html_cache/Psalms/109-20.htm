In the context of ancient Israel, false accusations were a serious offense, often leading to severe consequences for the accused. The psalmist appeals to God as the ultimate judge, a theme consistent throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8-9</a>). The concept of divine retribution is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to uphold justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>). This plea can be seen as a call for God to act according to His righteous character, ensuring that those who pervert justice face consequences. The imprecatory nature of this psalm aligns with other biblical instances where God's people seek His intervention against their enemies (e.g., <a href="/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35:1-8</a>).<p><b>to those who speak evil against me</b><br>The focus here is on the power of words and the damage they can inflict. In the biblical context, speaking evil or bearing false witness was not only a personal attack but also a violation of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The psalmist's experience echoes the trials faced by many biblical figures, including Jesus Christ, who was falsely accused and maligned (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>). This phrase highlights the spiritual battle against slander and deceit, emphasizing the need for God's protection and vindication. The New Testament reinforces this idea, encouraging believers to trust in God's justice and refrain from retaliation (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). The psalmist's cry for justice serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability all individuals have before God for their words and actions (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a plea for divine justice against his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/accusers.htm">Accusers</a></b><br>The individuals who are speaking evil against David, representing those who unjustly accuse and persecute the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine judge and protector whom David calls upon to deliver justice and recompense to his enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>Trust in God's ultimate justice rather than seeking personal vengeance.

The psalmist is not inventing a private form of payback; he is submitting his cause to the Lord&#8217;s courtroom (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;May&#8221; shows humble dependence&#8212;he is not commanding God but laying his petition before the Judge who &#8220;will by no means leave the guilty unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This wording echoes other cries for righteous vindication, such as &#8220;Vindicate me, O LORD, according to Your righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/35-24.htm">Psalm 35:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The request flows from confidence that God hears the oppressed and acts in His timing (<a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD&#8217;s reward</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Reward&#8221; here is used negatively: it is the fitting consequence that the righteous God assigns (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays God as the One who both blesses the faithful (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>) and repays the wicked (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing the outcome in the Lord&#8217;s hands, the psalmist resists personal vengeance, aligning with &#8220;Do not repay evil with evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This attitude anticipates the ultimate judgment seat of Christ where every deed is weighed (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to my accusers</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Accusers&#8221; refers to those pressing false charges, paralleling the enemies who beset David in <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11&#8211;12</a>.<p>&#8226; The psalmist is experiencing the sting of slander much like Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59&#8211;60</a>).<p>&#8226; Handing the matter to the Lord frees him from bitterness and fear, trusting that &#8220;no weapon formed against you shall prosper, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p>&#8226; He models the godly response outlined in <a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7&#8211;9</a>&#8212;wait patiently and let God act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those who speak evil against me</b><p>&#8226; The focus narrows to malicious speech&#8212;lies, half-truths, and character assassination (<a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that careless words will be judged (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>), and James reminds us that the tongue can be &#8220;a restless evil&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-8.htm">James 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The plea is not petty; it seeks alignment with the divine principle that &#8220;whoever digs a pit will fall into it&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s righteous &#8220;reward&#8221; protects the innocent, upholds truth, and deters future evil (<a href="/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/109-20.htm">Psalm 109:20</a> captures a believer&#8217;s appeal for God to bring fitting justice on slanderous opponents.
