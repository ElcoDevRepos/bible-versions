Throughout the Bible, God's timing is often emphasized, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. The psalmist recognizes that human efforts have failed, and only God's action can bring justice and restoration. This echoes the cries of the prophets, such as Habakkuk, who questioned why God seemed to delay in addressing the wickedness around him (<a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2-4</a>). The call for God to act is rooted in the belief that He is sovereign and just, and His intervention is both necessary and imminent.<p><b>for they have broken Your law</b><br>The breaking of God's law refers to the disobedience and rebellion against His commandments. In the context of ancient Israel, the law was central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, as outlined in the Torah. The psalmist's lament highlights the seriousness of this transgression, which is not merely a legal issue but a spiritual one, affecting the community's relationship with God. This breaking of the law can be seen throughout Israel's history, leading to periods of judgment and exile, as recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The law itself is a reflection of God's character and will, and breaking it signifies a rejection of His authority. This phrase also points forward to the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and offers a new covenant through His sacrifice, addressing the ultimate consequence of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep longing for God's intervention and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is called upon to act in response to the violation of His law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law (Torah)</a></b><br>Refers to God's instructions and commandments given to His people, which have been broken by those who oppose His will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_divine_intervention.htm">The Urgency of Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Recognize the times when it is necessary to call upon God to act, especially when His laws are being flagrantly violated.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_law.htm">The Importance of God's Law</a></b><br>Understand that God's law is not just a set of rules but a reflection of His character and will for humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_believer_in_a_lawless_society.htm">The Role of the Believer in a Lawless Society</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to uphold God's standards and be a light in a world that often disregards His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>While we may desire immediate action, trust that God knows the perfect time to intervene and bring justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_for_the_world.htm">Intercession for the World</a></b><br>Like the Psalmist, we should intercede for our world, asking God to act and bring people back to His truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_126_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:126?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/When_is_it_time_for_the_LORD_to_act.htm">How can we discern when it is "time for the LORD to act"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_violates_God_s_law_in_Psalm_119_126.htm">What actions violate God's law, as mentioned in Psalm 119:126?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_126_and_Romans_12_19_link.htm">How does Psalm 119:126 connect with God's justice in Romans 12:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_ignored_God_s_laws.htm">How should believers respond when God's laws are disregarded by society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/What_to_do_if_others_break_your_law.htm">What personal actions can you take when witnessing others "have broken Your law"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Psalm_119_126_LORD_act.htm">What does Psalm 119:126 mean when it says, "It is time for the LORD to act"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_126_Divine_timing_vs_impatience.htm">How does Psalm 119:126 challenge our understanding of divine timing and human impatience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_119_126_address_disobedience.htm">In what ways does Psalm 119:126 address the issue of human disobedience to God's law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_anthropology_show_moral_evolution.htm">How does anthropology show moral evolution rather than fixed divine laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_support_situational_ethics.htm">Is situational ethics supported by the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_memorizing_scripture_important.htm">Why is memorizing Scripture important?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/were_adam_and_eve_of_caucasian_descent.htm">Is His Word prioritized over His Name?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 119:126 Mean</div><b>It is time</b><p>The psalmist senses an urgent moment, not a casual wish.<p>&#8226;
