Angels are often depicted in Scripture as messengers (e.g., Gabriel in <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>) and warriors (e.g., Michael in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>). Their primary role is to worship and glorify God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim God's holiness. The command for angels to praise God underscores their role in the divine order and reflects the heavenly worship scene described in <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>, where countless angels surround the throne, praising God and the Lamb.<p><b>praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.</b><br>The term "heavenly hosts" refers to the multitude of celestial beings that serve God, including angels and other spiritual entities. This phrase emphasizes the vastness and diversity of God's creation in the spiritual realm. The heavenly hosts are often associated with God's power and majesty, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, where Micaiah describes a vision of the Lord's throne surrounded by the host of heaven. The call for the heavenly hosts to praise God highlights the universal nature of worship, extending beyond the earthly realm to include all of creation. This reflects the theme of cosmic praise found throughout the Psalms, where all elements of creation are called to glorify God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God to serve Him and carry out His will.
