In biblical context, when God swears an oath, it signifies an unchangeable and eternal decree. This is seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>, where God's oath is described as a guarantee of His promises. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal name of God, underscoring His faithfulness and sovereignty.<p><b>and will not change His mind:</b><br>This assures the immutability of God's purpose. In <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, it is stated that God is not like humans who change their minds. This phrase reinforces the idea that God's plans are steadfast and reliable. Theologically, it speaks to the doctrine of God's immutability, meaning His nature and promises remain constant throughout time.<p><b>&#8220;You are a priest forever</b><br>This part of the verse introduces the concept of an eternal priesthood, which is unique in the biblical narrative. Unlike the Levitical priesthood, which was temporary and hereditary, this priesthood is perpetual. This is a prophetic reference to Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a> as having a permanent priesthood, able to save completely those who come to God through Him.<p><b>in the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</b><br>Melchizedek is a mysterious figure who appears in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> as the king of Salem and priest of God Most High. His priesthood is significant because it predates the Levitical priesthood and is not based on lineage. This order is characterized by righteousness and peace, as seen in the meaning of Melchizedek's name and title. In <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, Melchizedek is used as a type of Christ, illustrating the superiority and eternal nature of Jesus' priesthood.
