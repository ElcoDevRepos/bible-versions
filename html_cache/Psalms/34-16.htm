In biblical context, the "face of the LORD" signifies His presence and attention. When God's face is against someone, it indicates disfavor and judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>, where God's face is turned against those who commit iniquity. Historically, this reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brought blessings and disobedience brought curses. Theologically, it underscores God's holiness and justice, as He cannot tolerate sin. This phrase also serves as a warning to the faithful to avoid evil and seek righteousness.<p><b>to wipe out all memory of them from the earth</b><br>This phrase speaks to the ultimate consequence of persistent evil: total eradication. In ancient Near Eastern culture, memory and legacy were crucial, as they ensured one's name and deeds lived on. The idea of being forgotten was a severe punishment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a> and <a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>. This reflects the biblical principle that the wicked will not endure, contrasting with the righteous, whose memory is blessed. Theologically, it points to the final judgment, where those who reject God face eternal separation. This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological hope found in Revelation, where evil is ultimately defeated, and God's kingdom is fully established.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after pretending to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/evildoers.htm">Evildoers</a></b><br>Those who commit acts contrary to God's will and righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The physical realm where human history unfolds and where God's justice is executed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The Philistine king before whom David feigned madness, leading to his escape.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>The verse underscores God's active opposition to evil.
