The "depths of the earth" can refer to the most profound and inaccessible parts of the world, symbolizing the entirety of creation from the lowest to the highest. Biblically, the "depths" often represent chaos or the unknown, yet they are firmly within God's grasp, indicating His omnipotence. This imagery is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/38-16.htm">Job 38:16</a>, where God questions Job about the mysteries of the deep, highlighting His supreme knowledge and authority. The hand of God is a metaphor for His power and care, suggesting that nothing is beyond His reach or understanding.<p><b>and the mountain peaks belong to Him</b><br>Mountains in biblical times were often seen as places of divine encounter and revelation, such as Mount Sinai where Moses received the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19-20) or Mount Carmel where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). The mention of "mountain peaks" signifies the majesty and grandeur of creation, which are under God's ownership and dominion. This phrase underscores the idea that from the lowest valleys to the highest summits, all creation is under God's authority. It also reflects the biblical theme of God as the Creator who not only formed the earth but also sustains it. The mountains, often seen as symbols of strength and stability, belong to God, reinforcing His ultimate power and the idea that He is the rightful ruler of all the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing His sovereignty and creative power over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/depths_of_the_earth.htm">Depths of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of the most profound and hidden parts of creation, indicating God's dominion over all aspects of the world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountain_peaks.htm">Mountain Peaks</a></b><br>Representing the highest and most majestic parts of the earth, also under God's control and ownership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that every part of creation, from the depths to the peaks, is under God's control.

The root to which the word is usually assigned means "to be weary," from which the idea of strength can only be derived on the <span class= "ital">lucus a non lucendo </span>principle. Keeping the usual derivation, we may, with many critics, give the word the sense of "mines" or "treasures," because of the labours of extracting metal from the earth. This suits <a href="/job/22-25.htm" title="Yes, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver.">Job 22:25</a>, and makes a good parallelism. But the LXX. and Vulg. have "heights," and by another derivation the Hebrew may mean shining, and so "sunny summit." With this agrees the rendering of the LXX. in <a href="/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt;
