The context of <a href="/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a> is a call for Israel to return to faithfulness. Historically, Israel faced numerous enemies, including the Canaanites, Philistines, and later, the Assyrians and Babylonians. God's promise to subdue enemies is consistent with His covenant with Israel, where obedience would lead to protection and victory (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate victory over spiritual enemies through Christ, who subdues sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</a>).<p><b>and turn My hand against their foes!</b><br>The imagery of God's hand signifies His power and intervention. In biblical times, the hand was often a symbol of strength and action. God's turning His hand against Israel's foes indicates a direct and decisive action to protect and deliver His people. This reflects the divine warrior motif found throughout the Old Testament, where God fights on behalf of Israel (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). It also points to the eschatological hope where God will ultimately defeat all evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ returns as the conquering King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His willingness to act on behalf of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The implied audience of the Psalm, representing God's chosen people who are being addressed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies/foes.htm">Enemies/Foes</a></b><br>Those who oppose or threaten Israel, whom God promises to subdue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Asaph, who is conveying God's message to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context.htm">Historical Context</a></b><br>Reflects a time when Israel faced external threats and needed divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_readiness_to_act.htm">God's Readiness to Act</a></b><br>God is always ready to intervene on behalf of His people when they turn to Him in obedience and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The promise of subduing enemies is contingent upon Israel's obedience, highlighting the importance of aligning our lives with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>Believers can trust in God's protection against spiritual and physical adversaries when they remain faithful to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_enemies.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Enemies</a></b><br>God has ultimate control over all adversaries, and His power is sufficient to overcome any opposition we face.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance_and_faithfulness.htm">Call to Repentance and Faithfulness</a></b><br>This verse serves as a reminder to repent from disobedience and return to a faithful relationship with God to experience His deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_81_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 81:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_ensure_God_subdues_enemies_fast.htm">How can we ensure God "quickly subdues" our enemies in our lives today?
