Singing is a common form of worship throughout the Bible, seen in the Psalms and in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). It reflects a heart of gratitude and joy, acknowledging God's sovereignty and goodness. Historically, singing was a central part of Israelite worship, often accompanied by instruments, as seen in the temple worship led by the Levites.<p><b>O you His saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, His faithful followers. In the Old Testament context, this would primarily refer to the Israelites, God's chosen people. In the New Testament, the term expands to include all believers in Christ (<a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). The call to the saints underscores the communal aspect of worship, inviting all who are dedicated to God to join in praise.<p><b>and praise His holy name</b><br>Praising God's holy name involves recognizing and honoring His character and attributes. The holiness of God's name signifies His purity, righteousness, and otherness. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence of a person. Thus, praising God's name is an acknowledgment of His divine nature and deeds. This phrase connects to the Third Commandment, which instructs not to take the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>), highlighting the reverence due to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/30.htm">Psalm 30</a>, David is expressing gratitude and calling others to worship God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure of worship in this verse, representing the covenant-keeping God of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful followers of God, those set apart for His purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_name.htm">Holy Name</a></b><br>Represents the character and essence of God, emphasizing His holiness and worthiness of praise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_worship.htm">The Call to Worship</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to actively participate in worship, not just individually but as a community of saints.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>Recognizing the holiness of God's name should inspire reverence and awe in our worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_in_praise.htm">Gratitude in Praise</a></b><br>Our praise should stem from a heart of gratitude for God's faithfulness and mercy in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_worship.htm">Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be a regular part of our lives, not just reserved for specific occasions or when we feel like it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>Engaging in worship together strengthens our faith and encourages others in their walk with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_30_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 30:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_praise_God_daily.htm">How can we "sing praises" to God in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_give_thanks_in_Psalm_30_4.htm">What does it mean to "give thanks" in Psalm 30:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_30_4_s_link_to_praise_in_Psalms.htm">How does Psalm 30:4 connect with other praise themes in the Psalms?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_remember_God_s_name_in_worship.htm">Why is it important to remember God's "holy name" in our worship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_30_4_Gratitude_in_tough_times.htm">How can Psalm 30:4 inspire gratitude during challenging times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_30_4_s_insight_on_ancient_worship.htm">What does Psalm 30:4 reveal about the nature of worship in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_30_4_s_role_in_faith_gratitude.htm">How does Psalm 30:4 emphasize the importance of gratitude in one's faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_30_4.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 30:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_30.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_it_mean_to_praise_god.htm">What does it mean to praise God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_temple_worship_essential_in_psalm_100_4.htm">Why does the psalm present worship at the temple ('enter his gates,' Psalm 100:4) as essential, when other parts of the Bible emphasize worship outside Jerusalem's temple?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_'one_god'_with_other_'gods'.htm">If, according to 1 Corinthians 8:6, there is only 'one God,' how do we reconcile this with other passages where divine beings or 'gods' are mentioned (e.g., Psalm 82)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_all_the_names_in_the_bible.htm">What are all the names in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 30:4 Mean</div><b>Sing to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The verse opens with an invitation, not a suggestion.

David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see <a href="/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, etc.).
