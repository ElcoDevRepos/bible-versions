The people grew tired of manna and craved the foods they had in Egypt. Their request was a sign of ingratitude and lack of faith in God's provision. This incident highlights the human tendency to desire immediate gratification over spiritual sustenance. It serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting in God's timing and provision, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>, where Jesus teaches about seeking first the kingdom of God.<p><b>but sent a wasting disease upon them</b><br>The "wasting disease" refers to the plague that struck the Israelites after they consumed the quail God provided in response to their complaints. This event is detailed in <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-34</a>, where the Lord's anger was kindled, and He struck the people with a severe plague. The term "wasting disease" underscores the consequences of disobedience and the spiritual decay that follows when one prioritizes fleshly desires over divine will. This serves as a warning echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-11</a>, where Paul uses Israel's history as an admonition for believers to avoid idolatry and immorality. Theologically, it reflects the principle that God's judgment can accompany His permissive will, allowing people to experience the consequences of their choices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.
