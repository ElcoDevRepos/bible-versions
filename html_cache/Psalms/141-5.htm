In biblical times, a "righteous man" was someone who lived in accordance with God's laws and was seen as morally upright. The idea of being "struck" by a righteous person can be understood metaphorically as receiving correction or discipline. <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> states, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend," emphasizing that true friends offer constructive criticism. This aligns with the biblical principle that discipline from the righteous is beneficial and should be welcomed.<p><b>let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion.</b><br>Rebuke, when given in love, is seen as an act of kindness and devotion. In the Hebrew culture, rebuke was not merely criticism but a means to guide someone back to the right path. The psalmist acknowledges that such correction is an expression of love and care, similar to how God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). This reflects the biblical theme that love often involves guiding others towards righteousness, even if it requires difficult conversations.<p><b>It is oil for my head;</b><br>Oil in ancient Israel was a symbol of blessing, healing, and anointing. Anointing the head with oil was a common practice to show honor and hospitality (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). By comparing rebuke to oil, the psalmist suggests that correction is not only beneficial but also a source of spiritual enrichment and honor. This imagery underscores the value of receiving guidance and correction as a means of spiritual growth and blessing.<p><b>let me not refuse it.</b><br>The psalmist expresses a willingness to accept correction, recognizing its importance for personal growth and spiritual maturity. This attitude is consistent with the wisdom literature of the Bible, which often emphasizes the importance of being teachable and open to instruction (<a href="/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8-9</a>). Refusing correction is seen as folly, while accepting it leads to wisdom and understanding.<p><b>For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.</b><br>The psalmist contrasts his openness to righteous correction with his opposition to wickedness. His prayers are directed against the actions of the wicked, indicating a commitment to righteousness and justice. This reflects the biblical theme of the righteous standing against evil and seeking God's intervention against injustice (<a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6</a>). The psalmist's dedication to prayer highlights the importance of seeking God's guidance and strength in opposing wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this psalm, David is expressing a desire for righteous correction and guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents those who live according to God's will and are capable of providing godly correction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked.htm">Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to those who act against God's commandments, whose deeds David opposes through prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/embrace_correction.htm">Embrace Correction</a></b><br>Understand that correction from a righteous person is an act of love and kindness.

David pictures righteous correction as the same&#8212;soothing, cleansing, and setting him apart for God.<p>- Refusing godly counsel would be like rejecting medicine that heals (<a href="/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8-9</a>; 15:5).<p>- By calling reproof &#8220;oil,&#8221; David reorients our feelings: what stings at first ultimately blesses. We must choose gratitude over defensiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked</b><p>- David&#8217;s ongoing prayer life shapes his loyalties. Aligning with God means opposing evil actions (<a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4-5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p>- Welcoming righteous correction keeps him from drifting toward the practices he prays against (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-2</a>).<p>- The verse closes with resolve: even while being corrected, David stays committed to interceding against wickedness, refusing any partnership with it (<a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a> celebrates godly correction. David teaches that when a righteous believer confronts us in love, it is a gracious gift&#8212;refreshing like anointing oil and protecting us from the path of the wicked. Humbly embracing such reproof honors God&#8217;s Word, deepens fellowship, and keeps our prayers aligned with His righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/141.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The difficulties of the psalm thicken here. Render, <span class= "ital">Let a righteous man smite me, it is a kindness; and let him reprove me, it is oil for the head: my head shall not refuse it though it continue; yet my prayer is against their wickedness.</span><p>The word rendered "smite" is that used of Jael's "hammer strokes "(<a href="/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>). (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>.) The Hebrew for "reprove" is probably used in a judicial sense, as in <a href="/genesis/31-37.htm" title="Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.">Genesis 31:37</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm" title="And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-25.htm" title="But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come on them.">Proverbs 24:25</a>, &c. The greatest obscurity attaches to the word rendered above "refuse," but in the Authorised Version "break," probably because in <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm" title="The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing: he makes the devices of the people of none effect.">Psalm 33:10</a> (" bring to none effect") it is in parallelism with "break." The LXX. and Vulg. take it as meaning "anoint," rendering (from a different text to ours) "let not oil of a wicked man anoint my head." If we might adopt this reading it would remove the difficulty of this part of the verse, and give an excellent parallelism: "A righteous man may smite me in mercy and reprove me, but let not a wicked man's oil anoint my head;" i.e., I would welcome reproof from the righteous, but reject even the festive oil offered by the wicked. For the rendering "wickednesses," instead of "calamities," comp. <a href="/job/20-12.htm" title="Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;">Job 20:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-23.htm" title="And he shall bring on them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yes, the LORD our God shall cut them off.">Psalm 94:23</a>. For the sense of "although" given to the conjunction, see <a href="/exodus/13-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:">Exodus 13:17</a>. The suffix "their" <span class= "ital">refers </span>back, of course, to the <span class= "ital">ungodly </span>in <a href="/psalms/141-4.htm" title="Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.">Psalm 141:4</a>. The "oil for the head" (comp. <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>) is a natural emblem of festivity, and the whole sentiment of the passage is tolerably clear. Rather than join in the wicked mirth of a profane banquet, the poet would be the object of continued rebuke and chastisement from one of the godly--his prayer meanwhile still rising for protection against the allurements held out to tempt him. We probably have sketched here the actual condition of many a Levite between the apostate and the loyal part of the nation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/141.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let the righteous smite me kindly</span>, as in the margin. <span class="cmt_word">And let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which my head shall not refuse</span>.

This healing oil will strengthen him to continue to pray for his enemies, even though they still continue in their "wickednesses." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/141-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let the righteous man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1511;
