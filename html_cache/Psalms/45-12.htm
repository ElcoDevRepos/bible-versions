In biblical times, Tyre was a powerful and prosperous city-state, often associated with commerce and luxury. The "Daughter of Tyre" symbolizes the people or representatives of Tyre, possibly indicating a diplomatic or political gesture. The act of bringing a gift suggests a tribute or offering, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures to show respect or allegiance. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, where Tyre's wealth and influence are acknowledged. Theologically, this gesture can be seen as a type of the nations coming to honor the Messiah, reflecting the broader biblical theme of Gentiles recognizing the sovereignty of God's anointed.<p><b>men of wealth will seek your favor.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the influence and honor bestowed upon the subject, likely a king or a figure of great importance. In the context of <a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>, which is a royal wedding psalm, this could refer to the king's bride, symbolizing the church or the people of God. The mention of "men of wealth" indicates that those with power and resources recognize the authority and significance of the one they seek to honor. This aligns with the biblical theme of kings and nations acknowledging the reign of God's chosen one, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-6</a>, where the wealth of nations is brought to Zion. In a Christological interpretation, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the homage paid to Jesus Christ by the wise men (Magi) in <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2</a>, who brought gifts and sought His favor, recognizing His kingship and divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_tyre.htm">Daughter of Tyre</a></b><br>Tyre was a significant Phoenician city known for its wealth and commerce.

King Hiram of Tyre supplied cedar for David and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1&#8211;11</a>), illustrating how Gentile powers honored God&#8217;s anointed. The psalm lifts this historic reality into a prophetic scene: the Messianic King will be acknowledged not only by Israel but by the nations (<a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/acts/21-3.htm">Acts 21:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Tyre&#8217;s daughter represents the whole Gentile world&#8212;cultured, influential, yet outside the covenant&#8212;drawn to honor the King they once ignored (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Israel&#8217;s brides were escorted by companions (<a href="/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>), so the royal Bridegroom&#8217;s court is enlarged by Gentile allies (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will Come with a Gift</b><p>&#8220;The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift&#8221;.

Hiram&#8217;s cedar acknowledged David; gold and frankincense acknowledged the infant Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetic echoes: &#8220;They will bring gold and frankincense and proclaim the praises of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ&#8217;s millennial and eternal reign, nations bring their glory into His city (<a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Men of Wealth</b><p>&#8220;Men of wealth&#8221; highlights the highest strata of society.
