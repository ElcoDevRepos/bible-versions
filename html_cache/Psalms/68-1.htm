The role of the choirmaster was crucial in ancient Israelite worship, as music played a significant part in the liturgical life of the community. This suggests the psalm's use in a formal setting, possibly during a festival or a significant religious event.<p><b>A Psalm of David.</b><br>Attributed to King David, this psalm reflects his role as a poet and musician. David's authorship connects the psalm to his life experiences, possibly during times of military victory or divine intervention. David's psalms often express deep trust in God and reliance on His power, reflecting his personal relationship with the Lord.<p><b>A song.</b><br>This designation highlights the psalm's lyrical nature, meant to be sung. The use of song in worship was a way to engage the community emotionally and spiritually, allowing the truths of the psalm to be internalized by the worshippers. Songs were a common method of teaching and reinforcing theological truths in ancient Israel.<p><b>God arises.</b><br>This phrase evokes imagery of God taking action, reminiscent of the divine warrior motif found throughout the Old Testament. It suggests God's intervention on behalf of His people, similar to His actions during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1-18</a>). The rising of God symbolizes His readiness to defend and deliver His people.<p><b>His enemies are scattered,</b><br>The scattering of enemies is a common biblical theme, indicating God's power to defeat those who oppose Him. This reflects the historical context of Israel's battles against surrounding nations, where divine intervention was often credited for victory. It also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of spiritual enemies through Christ's victory over sin and death.<p><b>and those who hate Him flee His presence.</b><br>This phrase underscores the fear and powerlessness of those who oppose God. It highlights the futility of resisting the Almighty and serves as a warning to those who reject Him. The concept of fleeing from God's presence is echoed in the New Testament, where ultimate judgment is described as separation from God (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). This also points to the eschatological hope of God's final victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this Psalm, King David, was a man after God's own heart and a central figure in the history of Israel.

What Moses prayed long ago, David now proclaims.<p>- When God &#8220;arises,&#8221; He takes the field as the undefeated champion (<a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>).<p>- This is no gradual unfolding but an immediate, decisive intervention: God stands, and everything changes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His enemies are scattered</b><p>- The moment God moves, opposition collapses. &#8220;The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated&#8230;they will flee in seven directions&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p>- David had watched this happen again and again (<a href="/psalms/92-9.htm">Psalm 92:9</a>), so his confidence is unshakable.<p>- The scattering underscores God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty; no rival can hold formation under His gaze.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those who hate Him flee His presence</b><p>- Hatred of God produces terror when He reveals Himself: &#8220;You will put them to flight when Your bow is strung toward their faces&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>).<p>- In <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>, armies melt away under divine pressure; <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a> shows the same flight on a cosmic scale.<p>- Fleeing highlights their loss of all control&#8212;God does not negotiate with rebellion; He overrules it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a> paints a swift, triumphant picture: at the first hint of God&#8217;s movement, every enemy line breaks and every hater runs. The heading reminds us this truth is meant to be celebrated in song, and David&#8217;s authorship assures us it is rooted in real history. For every believer facing opposition, the verse lifts our eyes to the God who only needs to rise to secure the victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/68.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Let God arise.</span>--A reminiscence of the battlecry raised as the ark was advanced at the head of the tribes (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a>).
