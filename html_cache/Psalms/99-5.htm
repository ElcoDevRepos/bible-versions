The term "exalt" suggests lifting up or placing in a position of honor, which is a common theme throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/99-9.htm">Psalm 99:9</a>). The use of "our God" indicates a personal relationship and covenantal bond between God and His people, reminiscent of the covenant with Israel (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This phrase encourages believers to recognize God's sovereignty and respond with reverence and adoration.<p><b>and worship at His footstool</b><br>The "footstool" is a metaphorical reference to the earth or the temple, where God's presence dwells (<a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>). In ancient Near Eastern culture, a footstool was a symbol of subjugation and authority, indicating that God reigns over all creation. Worshiping at His footstool implies humility and submission before God's throne, acknowledging His dominion. This imagery is also seen in the context of the Ark of the Covenant, which was considered God's earthly throne (<a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>). The call to worship here is an invitation to enter into God's presence with awe and reverence.<p><b>He is holy!</b><br>The declaration of God's holiness is central to understanding His nature. Holiness signifies God's absolute purity, moral perfection, and separation from sin. This attribute sets God apart from all creation and is a recurring theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/99-3.htm">Psalm 99:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>). The holiness of God demands a response of worship and reverence from His people. In the broader biblical narrative, God's holiness is a foundational aspect of His character, as seen in the visions of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>). The holiness of God also points to the need for atonement and purification, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's holiness and provides a way for believers to be reconciled to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is to be exalted and worshiped.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/footstool.htm">Footstool</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the earth or the temple, a place where God's presence is acknowledged and revered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/worship.htm">Worship</a></b><br>The act of reverence and adoration directed towards God, emphasizing His holiness and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exaltation_of_god.htm">Exaltation of God</a></b><br>We are called to lift up the name of the LORD, recognizing His supreme authority and majesty in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response.htm">Worship as a Response</a></b><br>Worship is not just a ritual but a heartfelt response to God's holiness and presence.
