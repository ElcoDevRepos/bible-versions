Thunder is frequently associated with divine revelation and judgment. In <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, God&#8217;s presence at Mount Sinai is accompanied by thunder, symbolizing His authority and the seriousness of His covenant. The imagery of God thundering from heaven also reflects His sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2-5</a>, where thunder is described as the voice of God. This phrase underscores the belief in God's active involvement in the world and His ability to intervene in human affairs.<p><b>the voice of the Most High resounded&#8212;</b><br>The "voice of the Most High" signifies God's supreme authority and His role as the ultimate judge. The title "Most High" is used throughout the Old Testament to denote God's exalted status above all other gods and powers, as seen in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High. The resounding voice indicates not only power but also clarity and decisiveness, suggesting that God's will is unmistakable and commands attention. This echoes the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the world into existence, highlighting the creative and commanding power of His voice.<p><b>hailstones and coals of fire.</b><br>This imagery is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, particularly the seventh plague in <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>, where hail mixed with fire is sent as a judgment against Pharaoh. It symbolizes divine wrath and judgment against the wicked, as well as protection for the righteous, as seen in <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>, where God uses hailstones to defeat Israel's enemies. The combination of hailstones and fire also points to the eschatological judgment described in <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, where hail and fire are part of the end-times plagues. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's power to execute judgment and His ultimate control over the elements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, symbolizing His sovereignty and authority over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High (Elyon)</a></b><br>A title for God that highlights His supreme power and majesty above all other beings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hailstones_and_coals_of_fire.htm">Hailstones and Coals of Fire</a></b><br>Elements of nature used by God as instruments of His judgment and power, often associated with divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all creation, and His power is unmatched.
