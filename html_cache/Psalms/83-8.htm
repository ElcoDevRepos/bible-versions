Known for its military prowess and expansionist policies, Assyria was a significant threat to Israel and its neighbors during the time of the Old Testament. The mention of Assyria joining the coalition against Israel highlights the severity of the threat faced by the Israelites. Historically, Assyria was known for its brutal conquests and deportations, which are documented in both biblical and extra-biblical sources. This phrase indicates a formidable alliance against Israel, as Assyria was a dominant force in the region.<p><b>lending strength to the sons of Lot</b><br>The "sons of Lot" refers to the Moabites and Ammonites, descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew. These groups often had contentious relationships with Israel, as seen in various Old Testament narratives. By aligning with Assyria, the Moabites and Ammonites gained significant military support, increasing the threat to Israel. This alliance underscores the persistent enmity between these nations and Israel, rooted in historical and familial tensions. The phrase also reflects the broader theme of Israel's neighbors conspiring against them, a recurring motif in the Psalms and prophetic literature.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical marker, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or emphasis. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but it serves to draw attention to the preceding statement, inviting the reader or listener to consider the gravity of the situation described. In this context, "Selah" may prompt reflection on the formidable alliance against Israel and the need for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful ancient empire known for its military might and influence.

Now he adds, &#8220;Even Assyria has joined them,&#8221; highlighting how the threat has escalated.<p>&#8226; Assyria was the regional superpower known for overwhelming armies and ruthless conquest (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>). Its inclusion tells readers that Israel&#8217;s enemies are not just neighboring tribes but a formidable empire.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;Even&#8221; stresses surprise and alarm&#8212;if Assyria is on board, the alliance is far more dangerous than the usual border skirmish (cf. <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>, where Assyria&#8217;s involvement instantly changes the balance of power).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore underscores the severity of the crisis: God&#8217;s people face overwhelming odds they cannot meet on their own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lending strength to the sons of Lot</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sons of Lot&#8221; refers to Moab and Ammon, the nations born from Lot&#8217;s descendants (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). These two had a complicated history with Israel, veering from uneasy neutrality to open hostility (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>; <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; By &#8220;lending strength,&#8221; Assyria is pictured as the backbone of the coalition, supplying military might, resources, and strategic muscle that Moab and Ammon lack. Similar coalitions appear in <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-13</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-2</a>, where outside help emboldens local foes.<p>&#8226; The line shows that what could have been a localized conflict is now turbo-charged by a global power, making the psalmist&#8217;s plea for divine intervention all the more urgent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Selah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Selah&#8221; functions as a musical and reflective pause. Here it invites readers to stop and absorb the gravity of the alliance before moving on (compare <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7, 11</a>; both end sections describing turmoil with &#8220;Selah&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The pause also signals confidence that, despite the terrifying lineup, God remains sovereign and will answer (<a href="/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1, 13</a>-18). The enemies are mighty, but the psalm is ultimately a call for God to act, reminding worshipers to rest in Him even while acknowledging the threat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/83-8.htm">Psalm 83:8</a> shows the climax of a hostile coalition: even the dominant Assyrian empire has thrown its weight behind Moab and Ammon (&#8220;the sons of Lot&#8221;), turning a regional threat into a seemingly hopeless situation. The verse magnifies Israel&#8217;s need for God&#8217;s intervention, and the &#8220;Selah&#8221; invites a pause to recognize both the peril and the assurance that the Lord will indeed rise to defend His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/83.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Assur.</span>--For the more usual <span class= "ital">Ashur, </span>Assyria.
