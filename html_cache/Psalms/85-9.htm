The concept of "fear" in biblical terms often denotes a deep respect and reverence for God, rather than terror. This reverence is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and Proverbs, where the "fear of the Lord" is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The nearness of salvation suggests God's readiness to deliver and protect His people, a promise seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>, where God is described as being near to His people whenever they call on Him. This nearness is also a foreshadowing of the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, whose name, Yeshua, means "salvation," and who is described as being "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>that His glory may dwell in our land</b><br>The dwelling of God's glory in the land is reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and later the temple, signifying God's presence among His people (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This phrase reflects the hope and expectation of God's manifest presence, bringing peace, prosperity, and righteousness. Historically, the land of Israel was seen as a special place where God's presence was uniquely experienced, a concept rooted in the covenant promises to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Theologically, this points forward to the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, where God's glory will dwell eternally with His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3, 23</a>). The phrase also carries a messianic expectation, as the coming of Christ is seen as the ultimate revelation of God's glory dwelling among humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/85.htm">Psalm 85</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who played a significant role in temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is addressed, representing God's chosen people who are seeking restoration and favor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's covenant and blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord.htm">The Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>The fear of the Lord is a reverential awe and respect for God, which is foundational for receiving His salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proximity_of_salvation.htm">Proximity of Salvation</a></b><br>God's salvation is not distant; it is near and accessible to those who live in reverence and obedience to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/glory_in_the_land.htm">Glory in the Land</a></b><br>When God's people live in accordance with His will, His glory is manifested in their midst, transforming communities and nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>The promise of salvation and glory is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and His people, emphasizing faithfulness and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>This verse offers hope for restoration, encouraging believers to seek God's presence and anticipate His transformative work in their lives and communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_85_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 85:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_85_9_s_call_for_reverence.htm">How does Psalm 85:9 encourage us to live in reverence to God?

(See <a href="/isaiah/32-16.htm" title="Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.">Isaiah 32:16</a> <span class= "ital">seq., </span><a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm" title="Drop down, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.">Isaiah 45:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-14.htm" title="And judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.">Isaiah 59:14</a>.) It is an allegory of completed national happiness, which, though presented in language peculiar to Hebrew thought, is none the less universal in its application. Nor does it stop at material blessings, but lends itself to the expression of the highest truths. The poet sees once more the <span class= "ital">glory </span>which had so long deserted the land come back--as its symbol, the ark, once came back--and take up its abode there. He sees the covenant <span class= "ital">favour </span>once more descend and meet the divine <span class= "ital">faithfulness </span>of which, lately, perplexed minds were doubting, but which the return of prosperity has now proved sure. Righteousness and peace, or prosperity, these inseparable brothers, kiss each other, and fall lovingly into each other's arms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/85.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him;</span> or, <span class="accented">will be nigh.</span> The answer to the prayer in ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">That glory may dwell in our land</span>. Professor Chevne asks, "What glory?" and suggests, "The true Shechinah, the manifested presence of Israel's God." But it may be doubtful whether anything more is meant than a return of earthly glory and prosperity, such as that for which Nehemiah laboured and prayed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/85-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;
