In the context of ancient Israel, the king's desires would often be for victory, justice, and the welfare of his people. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly aligns His desires with the will of the Father. The granting of desires also echoes the covenantal promises God made to David, ensuring the prosperity and success of his lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and have not withheld the request of his lips.</b><br>This part emphasizes God's responsiveness to prayer, highlighting the intimate relationship between the king and God. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, a king's requests would often involve matters of national importance, such as military success or divine guidance. This phrase can be connected to the New Testament teaching on prayer, where believers are encouraged to present their requests to God with the assurance that He hears and answers (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>). It also foreshadows the intercessory role of Christ, who prays on behalf of His people (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often understood as a pause for reflection or a musical interlude, inviting the reader or listener to contemplate the preceding words. In the context of this psalm, it serves as a moment to reflect on God's faithfulness in answering the king's prayers and fulfilling his desires. This pause encourages deeper meditation on the nature of God's provision and the importance of aligning one's desires with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, King David, is expressing gratitude for God's blessings and favor.
