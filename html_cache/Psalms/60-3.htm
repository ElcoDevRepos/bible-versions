Throughout the Old Testament, God often allowed His people to experience hardship as a means of correction and to draw them back to Himself. This is seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance in the Book of Judges. The hardships could be due to military defeat, famine, or other calamities. In the context of <a href="/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>, it is likely referring to military struggles during King David's reign, possibly against the Edomites or Arameans. This phrase underscores the belief that God is sovereign over the circumstances of His people, using even difficult situations to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.</b><br>The imagery of staggering from wine suggests a state of confusion or disorientation, often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe the effects of God's judgment. In <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, Jerusalem is described as having drunk from the cup of God's wrath, leading to a similar state of staggering. The "wine" here symbolizes the overwhelming nature of the trials faced by the people, which God has allowed or caused. This metaphor can also be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament, drinks the cup of God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), taking upon Himself the judgment deserved by sinners. The use of wine as a symbol of judgment contrasts with its use as a symbol of blessing and joy in other parts of Scripture, highlighting the dual nature of God's dealings with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>, David is expressing a lament over Israel's struggles and seeking God's intervention.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God who are experiencing hardship and divine discipline, as described in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who has allowed His people to experience hardship, symbolized by the staggering from wine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>The backdrop of the psalm, where David fought against Edom and sought God's help in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander, who played a significant role in the battles referenced in the context of this psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_discipline.htm">Understanding Divine Discipline</a></b><br>Recognize that hardships can be a form of God's discipline, intended to bring His people back to righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbolism_of_wine.htm">The Symbolism of Wine</a></b><br>The imagery of staggering from wine represents confusion and disorientation, which can occur when we face God's judgment or correction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_help.htm">Seeking God's Help</a></b><br>In times of hardship, like David, we should turn to God in prayer and seek His guidance and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_trials.htm">The Purpose of Trials</a></b><br>Trials and hardships can refine our faith and strengthen our reliance on God, as seen throughout Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_hardship.htm">God's Sovereignty in Hardship</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereignty, knowing that He allows hardships for a purpose and will ultimately bring about His good plans.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_60_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 60:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_help_when_intoxicated.htm">How can we seek God's help when feeling "wine that makes us stagger"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_60_3_God_s_discipline_our_response.htm">What does Psalm 60:3 teach about God's discipline and our response?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_60_3_and_Hebrews_12_6_link.htm">How does Psalm 60:3 connect with Hebrews 12:6 on God's correction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_purpose_in_confusion.htm">How can we trust God's purpose during times of spiritual disorientation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_regain_spiritual_stability.htm">What practical steps can we take to regain spiritual stability and clarity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_wine_that_makes_us_stagger.htm">What does Psalm 60:3 mean by "wine that makes us stagger"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_60_3_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">How does Psalm 60:3 reflect God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Psalm_60_3.htm">What historical context surrounds Psalm 60:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_60.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 60?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_believers_face_hardship_today.htm">If Psalm 3 assures the faithful of protection, why do many believers still face hardship or unanswered pleas today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/psalm_121_3_vs._life's_hardships.htm">Psalm 121:3 -

Hardship is not evidence of abandonment; it is evidence of His active, purposeful rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we are staggered</b><p>The next phrase pictures the community &#8220;staggered,&#8221; reeling like soldiers struck by forces they cannot withstand.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a> paints a similar scene: &#8220;They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill proved futile.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a> shows the same experience in the New Testament church: &#8220;We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.&#8221;<p>Feeling overwhelmed does not cancel faith; it frames faith. The literal stagger tells us the hardship has reached a point where human strength and strategies fail, making room for God&#8217;s deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wine you made us drink</b><p>Finally, the psalmist says the staggering comes &#8220;from the wine You made us drink.&#8221; Scripture often uses a cup or wine to symbolize God&#8217;s judgment or severe discipline.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a> calls Jerusalem to &#8220;stand up&#8230; you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of His wrath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a> records God handing the prophet &#8220;a cup of the wine of My wrath&#8221; to give the nations, causing them to stagger.<p>Here the figure is not poetic exaggeration but a literal statement that God&#8217;s chosen means of discipline feels like intoxication: disorienting, inescapable, and administered by His own hand. Yet the same God who gives the cup also sets its limit (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>) and ultimately removes it (<a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a> teaches that God deliberately allows seasons of hardship for His people, seasons so intense that we reel under the weight. The staggering is not random; it comes from the &#8220;wine&#8221; of divine discipline, measured out by a sovereign, loving Lord whose purposes are always wise. Recognizing His hand in hardship drives us away from self-reliance and back to humble trust, knowing that the God who gives the cup will, in His perfect time, bring restoration and victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/60.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Hard things</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, a hard fate.<p><span class= "bld">Wine of astonishment.</span>--Literally, either <span class= "ital">wine of reeling</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>an intoxicating draught--or <span class= "ital">wine as reeling</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, bewilderment like wine, or wine, which is not wine, but bewilderment, according as we take the construction.<p>In any case the figure is the same which meets us often in Hebrew poetry (comp. <a href="/context/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm" title="Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, &c) expressing that infatuation which the heathen proverb so well describes:--<p>"Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast showed thy people hard things;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a hard thing</span>, or <span class="accented">harshness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. severity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment;</span> or, <span class="accented">of trembling</span> (as in <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>); comp. <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>: 49:12; <a href="/ezekiel/23-32.htm">Ezekiel 23:32-34</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-2.htm">Zechariah 12:2</a>.
