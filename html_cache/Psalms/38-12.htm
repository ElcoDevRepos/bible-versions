The imagery of laying snares suggests a deliberate and cunning attempt to trap or harm the psalmist, akin to hunters setting traps for animals. This can be connected to David's experiences with King Saul, who sought his life out of jealousy and fear (1 Samuel 18-24). The use of "snares" also evokes the spiritual warfare believers face, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, where Paul speaks of the "schemes of the devil."<p><b>those who wish me harm speak destruction,</b><br>The desire for harm and the speaking of destruction indicate malicious intent and verbal attacks. In the ancient Near Eastern context, words held significant power, and curses or slander could have devastating effects on one's reputation and social standing. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power of the tongue, as seen in <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, where the tongue is described as a fire capable of great destruction. The psalmist's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced false accusations and verbal abuse (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>).<p><b>plotting deceit all day long.</b><br>The continuous nature of the plotting ("all day long") underscores the relentless and pervasive nature of the opposition. This mirrors the experience of many biblical figures who faced constant threats, such as Nehemiah, who dealt with persistent plots against his leadership (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-8</a>). The deceitful plotting also points to the broader theme of spiritual deception, as seen in the warnings against false prophets and teachers throughout Scripture (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot, who plotted deceitfully against Him (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/38.htm">Psalm 38</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's help amidst his suffering and the malice of his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The individuals who are actively seeking to harm David, setting traps and plotting deceit against him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, God is the ultimate refuge and source of hope for David throughout the psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_opposition.htm">The Reality of Opposition</a></b><br>Believers should be aware that opposition and deceit are part of the spiritual battle.
