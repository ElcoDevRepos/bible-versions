It echoes the divine judgment seen in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God allows individuals to pursue their sinful desires as a form of judgment. This concept is rooted in the idea of free will, where God permits humans to make their own choices, even when those choices lead away from Him. Historically, this reflects periods in Israel's history where they turned away from God, such as during the time of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>to their stubborn hearts</b><br>The term "stubborn hearts" indicates a willful resistance to God's guidance and commandments. Biblically, the heart is often seen as the center of will and emotion. In <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, God promises to replace a heart of stone with a heart of flesh, highlighting the transformation needed for true obedience. The stubbornness of Israel is a recurring theme, seen in their repeated idolatry and rebellion against God's covenant, as in the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 32).<p><b>to follow their own devices</b><br>This phrase suggests a departure from divine wisdom to human schemes and plans. <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> warns that "there is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death." The historical context includes Israel's alliances with foreign nations and adoption of pagan practices, which often led to their downfall. Spiritually, this reflects the human tendency to rely on self rather than God, a theme that is countered by the call to trust in the Lord with all one's heart (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His response to the Israelites' disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being addressed in this Psalm, known for their history of rebellion and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stubborn_hearts.htm">Stubborn Hearts</a></b><br>A metaphorical description of the Israelites' resistance to God's guidance and commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/devices.htm">Devices</a></b><br>Refers to the plans or schemes that the Israelites pursued, which were contrary to God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Asaph, who is conveying God's message to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_stubbornness.htm">The Danger of Stubbornness</a></b><br>Stubbornness in our hearts can lead us away from God's will and into spiritual danger.
