In biblical context, mountains often symbolize strength and stability. The "mountains of many peaks" could refer to the majestic ranges surrounding Jerusalem, such as the Mount of Olives or the hills of Bashan. These mountains, despite their grandeur, are not chosen by God, highlighting the theme of divine election. This reflects the biblical principle that God's choices often defy human expectations, as seen in His selection of David, the youngest son, to be king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p><b>This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling,</b><br>The mountain referred to here is Mount Zion, the site of Jerusalem and the Temple. Biblically, Zion is significant as the spiritual center of Israel, chosen by God as His earthly dwelling place. This choice underscores the importance of Jerusalem in God's redemptive plan, as it becomes the focal point for worship and the presence of God among His people. Theologically, this prefigures the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where God will dwell with humanity eternally.<p><b>where the LORD will surely dwell forever.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the permanence of God's presence on Mount Zion. Historically, the Temple in Jerusalem was seen as the dwelling place of God, where His glory resided (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The assurance of God's eternal dwelling points to the eschatological hope of God's unending reign. In Christian theology, this is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and in whom God's presence is fully realized. The eternal dwelling also anticipates the ultimate fulfillment in the new heaven and new earth, where God's presence will be with His people forever (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_many_peaks.htm">Mountains of Many Peaks</a></b><br>These represent the various majestic mountains that might symbolize power, grandeur, or spiritual significance.

That literary picture highlights how our God reverses human expectations.<p>&#8226; Size and splendor do not impress Him; what matters is His purpose. As <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; These &#8220;mountains of many peaks&#8221; likely recall the massive heights of Bashan (<a href="/psalms/68-15.htm">Psalm 68:15</a>) or the proud ranges of the world. Yet God does not seek the grandest setting to display His glory&#8212;He chooses the place that serves His redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture God delights in overturning pride: &#8220;God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), just as He now humbles lofty mountains before Zion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling</b><p>Zion&#8217;s significance rests entirely on divine election, not geography.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a> declares, &#8220;For the LORD has chosen Zion&#8230; &#8216;This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; From the wilderness onward, God moved His presence&#8212;from the tabernacle in Shiloh (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) to the temple on Mount Moriah&#8212;guiding Israel to this very hill (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By choosing Zion, God makes a statement about His covenant grace. Just as He chose Israel &#8220;not because you were more numerous&#8230; but because the LORD loved you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>), He chooses a modest mountain to showcase that love.<p>&#8226; The choice also anticipates the final gathering of all nations to God&#8217;s dwelling: &#8220;The mountain of the house of the LORD will be established as chief among the mountains&#8230; and all nations will stream to it&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where the LORD will surely dwell forever</b><p>God&#8217;s presence on Zion points beyond David&#8217;s day to an unending reality.<p>&#8226; &#8220;As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>).
