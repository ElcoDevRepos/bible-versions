The imagery of God's "hands" suggests a personal and careful crafting, akin to a potter shaping clay (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>). This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and intentionality in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humanity is made in the image of God. The use of "fashioned" implies not just physical creation but also the shaping of one's character and purpose. This aligns with <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>, where Job acknowledges God's hand in his creation, and <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-14</a>, which speaks of being fearfully and wonderfully made. The phrase underscores the belief in a purposeful design, countering any notion of randomness in human existence.<p><b>give me understanding to learn Your commandments.</b><br>This request for understanding highlights the psalmist's desire for divine wisdom to comprehend and obey God's laws. It reflects the biblical principle that true understanding comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The psalmist's plea is not just for intellectual knowledge but for spiritual insight that leads to obedience, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask God for wisdom. The commandments refer to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were central to Jewish life and worship. This request aligns with the broader biblical theme of seeking God's guidance and the transformative power of His Word (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). It also points to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), where believers are called to follow His teachings as the ultimate expression of God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who is expressing a deep desire for understanding and guidance from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, whose hands have made and fashioned the psalmist, indicating His intimate involvement in the creation and purpose of each individual.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandments.htm">The Commandments</a></b><br>Refers to God's laws and teachings, which the psalmist seeks to understand and follow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god_as_creator.htm">Acknowledgment of God as Creator</a></b><br>Recognize that God&#8217;s hands have made and fashioned each of us, affirming our value and purpose in His design.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_for_divine_understanding.htm">Desire for Divine Understanding</a></b><br>Like the psalmist, we should earnestly seek understanding from God to learn and live by His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_god's_commandments.htm">The Role of God&#8217;s Commandments</a></b><br>God&#8217;s commandments are not just rules but a guide to living a life that honors Him and fulfills our created purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_wisdom.htm">Prayer for Wisdom</a></b><br>Regularly pray for wisdom and understanding, trusting that God will provide the insight needed to navigate life according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_god's_workmanship.htm">Living as God&#8217;s Workmanship</a></b><br>Embrace the identity of being God&#8217;s workmanship, created for good works, and actively seek to fulfill the purpose He has set for us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_73_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:73?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_73_on_God_s_creation_role.htm">How does Psalm 119:73 emphasize God's role in our creation and understanding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_follow_God_s_commands_daily.htm">What practical steps can we take to seek God's "commands" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_73_Gen_1_27_God_s_creation_link.htm">How does Psalm 119:73 connect with Genesis 1:27 about being made by God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_God_s_commands_daily.htm">In what ways can we apply God's "commands" to our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_creation_boost_trust_in_God.htm">How can understanding God's creation of us enhance our trust in His guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_73_creation_purpose_link.htm">How does Psalm 119:73 relate to the concept of divine creation and human purpose?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_73_God_s_role_in_our_lives.htm">What does Psalm 119:73 reveal about God's role in human life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_73_and_God_s_omnipotence.htm">How does Psalm 119:73 support the belief in God's omnipotence?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_of_psalms.htm">What are the key themes of the Book of Psalms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_god_command_violence_then.htm">Why did God command violence in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_anthropomorphism.htm">What is anthropomorphism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_the_law_of_moses_eternal.htm">Is the Law of Moses eternal?
