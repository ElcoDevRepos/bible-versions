The first event occurred at Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>), and the second at Kadesh (<a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>). The location is significant as it represents a place of testing and rebellion against God. Archaeologically, the exact location is debated, but it is generally associated with the region near the Sinai Peninsula. Theologically, Meribah symbolizes human disobedience and lack of faith, contrasting with God's faithfulness.<p><b>they angered the LORD</b><br>The Israelites' actions at Meribah were characterized by complaints and lack of trust in God's provision. This angered the LORD because it demonstrated a failure to remember His past deliverance and miracles. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting God's holiness and the seriousness of sin. This phrase connects to other instances where Israel's disobedience provoked God's wrath, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16).<p><b>and trouble came to Moses because of them</b><br>Moses, as the leader of the Israelites, bore the consequences of the people's rebellion. At Meribah, Moses struck the rock twice to bring forth water, disobeying God's command to speak to the rock (<a href="/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8-12</a>). This act of disobedience resulted in God forbidding Moses from entering the Promised Land. The phrase underscores the heavy burden of leadership and the impact of communal sin on individual leaders. It also serves as a typology of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity, though unlike Moses, Christ was without sin. Moses' experience at Meribah is a sobering reminder of the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Years later, the scene repeats in <a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>, the setting <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a> recalls.<p>- Meribah reminds us that even after countless miracles&#8212;manna, quail, the cloud and fire&#8212;Israel still doubted God&#8217;s daily care (<a href="/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-20</a>).<p>- The location was not the problem; unbelief was. <a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8-9</a> points back here, urging later generations, &#8220;Do not harden your hearts as at the rebellion&#8230; where your fathers tested Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They angered the LORD</b><p>- Persistent grumbling &#8220;angered the LORD,&#8221; a sober reminder that God responds personally to sin, not merely in detached justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-22.htm">Deuteronomy 9:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8-11</a>).<p>- Their complaint questioned His goodness, slandering His character after He had rescued them (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>).<p>- The Lord&#8217;s anger is never capricious; it arises when His holy, faithful nature is defied. That makes rebellion at Meribah more than a bad mood&#8212;it is spiritual treason (<a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Trouble came to Moses</b><p>- Moses, normally the intercessor, became entangled in their sin. <a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a> narrates his moment of frustration: he struck the rock twice and spoke rashly, failing to &#8220;uphold My holiness before the Israelites,&#8221; the LORD said.<p>- Because of that lapse, &#8220;the LORD was angry with me also on your account&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>), barring Moses from entering Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-4.htm">Deuteronomy 34:4</a>).<p>- Leadership carries weight: when people rebel and leaders react poorly, everyone feels the fallout.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of them</b><p>- <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a> underlines shared responsibility. The people&#8217;s unbelief set the stage: Moses suffered &#8220;because of them.&#8221;<p>- Sin rarely stays private; it spreads. Israel&#8217;s complaining culture pressured Moses into anger, showing how one member&#8217;s choices can harm the whole body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>; though written later, the principle is timeless).<p>- Yet God remains just: the people faced discipline (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>) and Moses faced discipline. Divine holiness is impartial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a> distills a wilderness tragedy. At Meribah, Israel&#8217;s unbelief provoked the LORD. Their leader, drawn into their strife, lashed out and forfeited his entry into the Promised Land. The verse warns every generation: unbelief angers God, poisons community, and burdens even faithful leaders.
