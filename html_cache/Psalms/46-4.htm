The imagery of a river suggests a continuous and abundant source of sustenance and blessing. In the context of ancient Israel, rivers were vital for agriculture and survival, making them a powerful metaphor for divine provision. This river can be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, who flows into the lives of believers, bringing spiritual nourishment and life.<p><b>whose streams delight the city of God</b><br>The "city of God" refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. In a broader sense, it symbolizes the dwelling place of God among His people. The streams that delight the city suggest peace, joy, and divine favor. This imagery can be connected to the Garden of Eden, where a river watered the garden, symbolizing God's perfect provision. The delight of the city can also be seen as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem described in Revelation, where God's presence brings eternal joy and peace.<p><b>the holy place</b><br>This phrase refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the sacred space where God's presence was believed to dwell among His people. The temple was central to Jewish worship and identity, representing God's covenant relationship with Israel. The holiness of this place underscores the idea of separation from sin and dedication to God. It also points to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate holy place, as He embodied the presence of God on earth and through whom believers have access to God.<p><b>where the Most High dwells</b><br>The "Most High" is a title for God, emphasizing His supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation. His dwelling among His people signifies His commitment to be with them, guiding and protecting them. This presence was manifested in the temple, but ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is Immanuel, "God with us." The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers today continues this theme, as God resides within His people, making them His temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_river.htm">The River</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's provision, peace, and presence.

The river, flowing calmly and smoothly along, may be only a symbol of the peace and blessing of the Divine presence, as the tumult and tempest of the sea in the last verse are of the world's noisy troubles.

To this city he assigns a "river, the streams whereof make her glad;" imagery in which we may recognize the perennial fountain of God's grace - that "pure river of water of life," which, welling forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb, continually refreshes and gladdens the Church of Christ (<a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>), whether her dwell-tug-place be the earthly or the heavenly Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>).
