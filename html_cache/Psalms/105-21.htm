After interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, Joseph was appointed as the second-in-command, overseeing Pharaoh's household and the entire land of Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>). This elevation is a fulfillment of the dreams Joseph had as a young man, where his family would bow to him (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). Joseph's rise to power is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness, demonstrating how God can use difficult circumstances for His purposes. Joseph's role as master of Pharaoh's household prefigures Christ, who is the head of the Church, His household (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>).<p><b>ruler over all his substance</b><br>Joseph's authority extended beyond Pharaoh's household to all of Egypt's resources.
