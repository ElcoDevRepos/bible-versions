The concept of a "close friend" in ancient Israelite culture implies a relationship of mutual trust and loyalty. This betrayal is particularly poignant because it comes from someone within David's inner circle, reflecting the pain of personal treachery. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, as Jesus Himself references this verse in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, indicating its prophetic nature.<p><b>the one who shared my bread</b><br>Sharing bread in the ancient Near East was a sign of fellowship and covenant. It was a gesture of peace and trust, often signifying a bond of friendship and mutual support. In the context of David's life, this could refer to Ahithophel, his counselor who betrayed him during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>). In the New Testament, this imagery is fulfilled in the Last Supper, where Jesus shares bread with His disciples, including Judas, who would soon betray Him. This act underscores the gravity of Judas's betrayal, as it breaks the sacred bond of shared bread.<p><b>has lifted up his heel against me</b><br>The phrase "lifted up his heel" is an idiomatic expression suggesting an act of treachery or betrayal. It evokes the image of a horse kicking back at its master, symbolizing a sudden and unexpected attack from someone trusted. This imagery is consistent with the cultural understanding of betrayal as a grievous offense. In the New Testament, Jesus applies this phrase to Judas's betrayal, highlighting the fulfillment of this prophecy and the continuity of the theme of betrayal from David's experience to Christ's own suffering. This connection emphasizes the typological relationship between David and Jesus, with David's experiences prefiguring those of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, King David, is expressing a personal betrayal by someone close to him.
