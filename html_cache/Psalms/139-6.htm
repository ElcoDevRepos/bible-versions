The "knowledge" refers to God's intimate understanding of the psalmist's thoughts, actions, and even his formation in the womb, as described earlier in the psalm. This echoes the biblical theme of God's incomprehensible wisdom, as seen in <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>, where Job acknowledges that God's plans are "too wonderful" for him to understand. The Hebrew word for "wonderful" (&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, pala) often denotes something extraordinary or miraculous, suggesting that God's knowledge is beyond human comprehension. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>too lofty for me to attain</b><br>The term "lofty" indicates something elevated or exalted, emphasizing the transcendence of God's understanding. This reflects the biblical theme of human limitation in grasping divine mysteries, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. The psalmist's admission of his inability to "attain" this knowledge underscores the humility required in recognizing human limitations before God. This humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, where believers are encouraged to trust in God's wisdom rather than their own understanding (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The phrase also points to the idea that while humans are made in the image of God, there remains a vast chasm between human and divine understanding, highlighting the need for faith and reliance on God's revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, King David, is expressing his awe at God's omniscience and omnipresence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The central figure in this Psalm, whose attributes of omniscience and omnipresence are being praised.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation to which David belonged, often the context for his writings and reflections on God's nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_understanding.htm">The Limitations of Human Understanding</a></b><br>Recognize that God's knowledge and wisdom are beyond human comprehension.
