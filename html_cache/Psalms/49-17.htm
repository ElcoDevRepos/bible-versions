In <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, it is stated that there is "a time to be born and a time to die," highlighting the natural cycle of life. The Bible often reminds believers of the brevity of life, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. This serves as a call to live with an eternal perspective, focusing on spiritual rather than material wealth.<p><b>he will carry nothing away</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the futility of earthly possessions in the face of death. <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a> reflects a similar sentiment: "Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb, and naked I will depart." The cultural context of the ancient Near East, where wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, contrasts with this biblical teaching that material wealth holds no value in the afterlife. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<p><b>his abundance will not follow him down</b><br>The term "abundance" refers to material wealth and possessions. The phrase "will not follow him down" suggests the descent into Sheol, the Hebrew concept of the grave or the abode of the dead. This reflects the biblical theme that earthly riches cannot secure one's eternal destiny. In <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, Jesus tells the parable of the rich fool, who stored up earthly wealth but was not "rich toward God." This serves as a warning against placing trust in material wealth rather than in God. The verse calls believers to consider the eternal implications of their lives and to prioritize spiritual riches that endure beyond death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/49.htm">Psalm 49</a>, traditionally attributed to the sons of Korah, who were Levites and temple musicians.

Nothing in the way of earthly possessions - nothing but the qualities which he has imprinted on his soul, and made part and parcel of himself. The heathen nations, foolishly, were accustomed to bury clothes, and arms, and vessels, and stores of gold with the departed, as though they could take these with them into the other world (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. pp. 59-62, end notes 9, 1, 2). The writer of the psalm, and those whom he addressed, were equally aware of the foolishness of such customs. <span class="cmt_word">His glory shall not descend after him.</span> Whatever "glory" his wealth has secured to him in this life shall be left behind.
