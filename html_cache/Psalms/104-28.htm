The imagery of gathering suggests a natural response to divine generosity, reminiscent of the Israelites collecting manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-18</a>). This act of gathering reflects human responsibility to receive and utilize God's gifts. The phrase underscores the biblical principle that God is the ultimate provider, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>, where God is called Jehovah-Jireh, meaning "The Lord will provide." The act of gathering also implies a communal aspect, as seen in the early church's practice of sharing resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>when You open Your hand,</b><br>The open hand symbolizes God's willingness to bless and provide abundantly. This imagery is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as generous and benevolent, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>, "You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing." The open hand contrasts with a closed fist, which would signify withholding or judgment. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, an open hand was a sign of friendship and peace, reinforcing the idea of God's gracious nature. This phrase also points to the New Testament depiction of Jesus, who often used His hands to heal and bless (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>).<p><b>they are satisfied with good things.</b><br>Satisfaction with good things reflects the fulfillment and contentment that come from God's provision. This echoes the promise of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." The "good things" can be understood as both physical sustenance and spiritual blessings, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a> to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, with the assurance that all these things will be added. The satisfaction mentioned here is not merely temporary but points to the deeper, eternal satisfaction found in a relationship with God, as Jesus offers in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, declaring Himself the bread of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the provider and sustainer of all creation.
