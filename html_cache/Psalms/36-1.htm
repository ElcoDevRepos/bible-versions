The role of the choirmaster was significant in ancient Israel, as music was a central part of worship in the temple. This highlights the communal aspect of the psalm, meant to be shared and reflected upon by the congregation.<p><b>A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.</b><br>David, the author, is identified as the servant of the LORD, emphasizing his role as a humble and devoted follower of God. This title reflects David's relationship with God and his position as king, chosen by God to lead Israel. David's life, marked by both triumphs and failures, provides a rich backdrop for understanding his insights into human nature and divine grace.<p><b>An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man:</b><br>The term "oracle" suggests a divine revelation or insight given to David. This phrase indicates that David is speaking from a place of deep understanding, possibly inspired by the Holy Spirit. The focus on the "transgression of the wicked man" points to a moral and spiritual failing, highlighting the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. This theme is prevalent throughout the Psalms and other wisdom literature, such as Proverbs.<p><b>There is no fear of God before his eyes.</b><br>The absence of the fear of God is a central issue in the wicked man's life. In biblical terms, the "fear of God" is often synonymous with reverence, respect, and acknowledgment of God's authority and holiness. This lack of fear leads to moral decay and rebellion against God's laws. The phrase echoes themes found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/3-18.htm">Romans 3:18</a>, where Paul describes the universal sinfulness of humanity. The absence of the fear of God is a root cause of sin and is contrasted with the wisdom and understanding that come from fearing the Lord, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this Psalm, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

David&#8217;s words were meant to be sung by the assembled congregation, reminding us that truth is proclaimed and reinforced when God&#8217;s people lift their voices together (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>). Worship is not merely personal; it is a community act that shapes hearts and declares God&#8217;s character to all who listen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD</b><p>By calling himself &#8220;the servant of the LORD,&#8221; David highlights humble dependence on God rather than royal status (<a href="/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>). A servant obeys the Master&#8217;s voice, so David writes with the authority of experience and submission. His life illustrates that true leadership flows from yielded hearts (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man</b><p>David testifies that the message he shares is an &#8220;oracle&#8221;&#8212;a God-given revelation, not personal speculation (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God plants truth deep &#8220;in my heart,&#8221; underscoring internal conviction before external proclamation (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The focus is &#8220;the transgression of the wicked,&#8221; exposing sin as active rebellion, not accidental misstep (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture faithfully diagnoses human nature, revealing what we would not see on our own (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is no fear of God before his eyes</b><p>Here David states the root problem: a total absence of reverence for God (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Without godly fear, conscience grows dull and self becomes the highest authority (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul cites this verse in <a href="/romans/3-18.htm">Romans 3:18</a> to prove universal sinfulness and the need for redemption.<p>&#8226; True wisdom begins when we acknowledge God&#8217;s holiness and submit to His rule (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Rejecting that fear uncovers every other form of wickedness (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1</a> opens by framing David&#8217;s words for congregational worship and by identifying the writer as a humble servant. God places a clear oracle in David&#8217;s heart: the essence of human rebellion is the lack of fear of God. When reverence disappears, sin dominates. In worship, we confront this truth, acknowledge our need, and turn our eyes back to the Lord who alone can restore proper fear and grant righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart . . .</span>--The literal rendering of the present Hebrew text is, <span class= "ital">An utterance of sin to the wicked within my heart. </span>The common phrase rendered in our version, "Thus saith Jehovah," is here imitated, "Thus saith sin." "To the wicked" cannot, as some explain, mean "concerning the wicked." The only possible meaning of the text as it stands is therefore, "Thus saith sin to (me) the wicked man in my heart." But there can be no question that the psalmist wrote "in <span class= "ital">his </span>heart," since ail the ancient versions, with the exception of the Chaldee Paraphrase, followed this reading, and some MSS. still show it. This gives us a very fine sense. Sin is personified as the evil counsellor or prompter sitting in the heart of the wicked to suggest evil thoughts: <span class= "ital">Sin in the wicked man's heart is his oracle. </span>Conscience is on the wrong side.<p><span class= "bld">There is no fear . . .</span>--This is not the suggestion of sin just mentioned, but an explanation of the condition into which the wicked man has sunk. Impiety and irreverence have so corrupted his nature, that sin has become his oracle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The transgression of the wicked saith within</span> <span class="cmt_word">my heart.</span> This is a difficult passage. In the first place, the text is uncertain, since some manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>, "his heart," in the place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart." And further, whichever reading we prefer, the meaning is far from clear. Dr. Kay translates, "Transgression's oracle to the wicked is, 'In the interior of my own heart;'" and understands the meaning to be that the sinfulness of the wicked man deludes him into the belief that his wickedness is known to no one but himself - it is all safely locked up in the recesses of his own heart. Professor Alexander suggests as possible, "Thus saith depravity to the wicked man, 'In the midst of my heart, there is no fear of God before his (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's) eyes.'" Others, preferring <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, render, "Transgression speaks to the wicked within his heart; There is no fear of God," etc.; regarding the two clauses as perfectly independent the one of the ether. This is, perhaps, the best explanation. There is <span class="cmt_word">no fear of God before his eyes.</span> Either he belongs to the class of "fools, who say in their heart, There is no God" (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>), or he agrees with those who cry, "Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face; he will never see it" (<a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/36-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the choirmaster.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1452;&#1495;&#1463;
