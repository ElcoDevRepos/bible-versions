In the biblical context, the psalmist is expressing a moment of doubt during a time of distress. The question implies a struggle with understanding God's nature, which is consistently portrayed as gracious throughout Scripture. In <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, God is described as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." This rhetorical question highlights the tension between the psalmist's current experience and the historical understanding of God's character. It invites reflection on the nature of divine grace, which is unmerited favor, and challenges believers to trust in God's unchanging nature even when circumstances seem contrary.<p><b>Has His anger shut off His compassion?</b><br>This phrase suggests a fear that God's wrath might have eclipsed His mercy. In the historical and cultural context of Israel, God's anger was often understood as a response to covenant unfaithfulness, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges. However, God's compassion is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which assures that "His compassions never fail. They are new every morning." The psalmist's question reflects a common human struggle to reconcile God's justice with His mercy. It also points to the prophetic hope found in Jesus Christ, who embodies both God's justice and mercy, offering redemption and reconciliation.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical marker, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or emphasis. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but it serves as an invitation to pause and meditate on the preceding words. In this context, "Selah" encourages the reader to contemplate the profound questions about God's nature and to seek a deeper understanding of His grace and compassion. It underscores the importance of reflection in the life of faith, allowing believers to process their doubts and reaffirm their trust in God's unchanging character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.

Remembering these anchors the heart when feelings suggest abandonment.<p>&#8226; Scripture affirms the impossibility of divine forgetfulness: &#8220;Can a woman forget her nursing child&#8230;?
