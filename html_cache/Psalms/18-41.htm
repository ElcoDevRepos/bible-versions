In biblical history, crying out for help was a common response in times of distress, as seen in the Israelites' cries during their bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>). The absence of a savior here underscores the futility of opposing God's chosen ones. It also highlights the justice of God, who does not support the wicked in their rebellion against His will. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme that salvation and deliverance come from the Lord alone (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>).<p><b>to the LORD, but He did not answer.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God in choosing when and whom to answer. It reflects the principle that God hears the prayers of the righteous but is far from the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>). The silence of God here serves as a form of judgment against those who have rejected His ways. This can be seen in the broader biblical narrative where God sometimes withholds His response as a consequence of sin, as in the case of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). Theologically, it points to the necessity of a right relationship with God to receive His aid, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is reflecting on his deliverance from his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
