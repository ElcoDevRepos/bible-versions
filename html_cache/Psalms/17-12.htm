In biblical times, lions were common in the regions of Israel and were known for their strength and ferocity. The lion is often used in Scripture to represent danger and destruction (e.g., <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where Satan is described as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour). This imagery underscores the threat David feels from his adversaries, who are eager to harm him. The lion's greediness for prey highlights the insatiable and aggressive nature of these enemies, reflecting their determination to destroy David without mercy.<p><b>like a young lion lurking in ambush</b><br>The young lion, or "young lion" in some translations, suggests a creature that is not only strong but also cunning and strategic. Young lions are known for their energy and ability to hide and wait patiently for the right moment to strike. This part of the verse emphasizes the stealth and deceit of David's foes, who are lying in wait to catch him off guard. The concept of ambush indicates a premeditated and calculated attack, further illustrating the danger David faces. This imagery can be connected to other biblical passages where enemies are described as lying in wait (e.g., <a href="/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>). The lurking young lion can also be seen as a type of the adversaries of Christ, who plotted against Him in secret, ultimately leading to His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>, David is expressing his plea for God's protection against his enemies.
