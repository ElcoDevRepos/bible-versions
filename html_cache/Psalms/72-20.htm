In the context of the Psalms, it marks a transition, as <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a> is often considered a royal psalm, possibly written by Solomon or for Solomon, reflecting on the ideal king. The conclusion here may indicate the end of a specific section within the Psalter, traditionally associated with Davidic authorship. The use of "prayers" highlights the psalms as not just songs but also petitions and intercessions to God, reflecting a deep reliance on divine guidance and intervention.<p><b>of David</b><br>David, the second king of Israel, is a central figure in the Old Testament. Known for his heart for God, David's life and reign are chronicled in the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles. His psalms often reflect his personal experiences, struggles, and triumphs, providing a model of faith and repentance. David's role as a psalmist is significant, as he is traditionally credited with composing many of the psalms, which serve as a foundation for Jewish and Christian worship. His prayers often foreshadow the coming of the Messiah, a descendant of David, fulfilling God's covenant promise.<p><b>son of Jesse</b><br>This designation emphasizes David's humble beginnings and his rise from shepherd to king. Jesse, David's father, was a Bethlehemite, and David's anointing by the prophet Samuel is a pivotal moment in biblical history (1 Samuel 16). The reference to Jesse roots David in the tribe of Judah, fulfilling Jacob's prophecy that the scepter would not depart from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). This lineage is crucial for messianic prophecies, as Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "Son of David," establishing His rightful place in the Davidic line and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The primary author of many Psalms, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a man after God's own heart. His life was marked by both triumphs and failures, yet he consistently sought God's guidance and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David, Jesse was a Bethlehemite and part of the lineage that would eventually lead to Jesus Christ. His family was chosen by God to bring forth the future king of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayers_of_david.htm">Prayers of David</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the collection of prayers and songs attributed to David, many of which are found in the Book of Psalms. These prayers express a wide range of emotions and themes, from praise and worship to lament and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_legacy_of_prayer.htm">The Legacy of Prayer</a></b><br>David's prayers are a testament to his enduring faith and reliance on God.

The single word signals a deliberate wrap-up, much like the closing &#8220;Amen and Amen&#8221; in the preceding verse (<a href="/psalms/72-19.htm">Psalm 72:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It gathers everything just voiced about the universal reign of the Messiah and says, in effect, &#8220;This is the settled testimony.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar pivot words appear at the end of other psalms: &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pauses with a &#8220;thus&#8221; to underline certainty&#8212;think of <a href="/1_kings/8-15.htm">1 Kings 8:15</a>, where Solomon begins his temple dedication by affirming, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Conclude</b><p>&#8226; The verb signals finality but not exhaustion; the worship continues even as the written prayers close.<p>&#8226; Paul captures the same idea in <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>, &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race,&#8221; yet his communion with the Lord endures.<p>&#8226; David himself once ended a life chapter by saying, &#8220;Here I am, dwelling in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>), showing that earthly conclusions always point to greater divine story lines.<p>&#8226; The ending provides a boundary for Book II of Psalms (42&#8211;72), preparing the reader for a new section while affirming all that has come before.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The prayers</b><p>&#8226; Psalms are songs, prophecies, and also prayers&#8212;personal words offered to God and preserved for His people.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s habit of pouring out his heart is seen in <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>, &#8220;Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us these compositions are not merely literature; they are living dialogue, inviting us to echo them (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling them &#8220;prayers,&#8221; Scripture validates every lament, praise, and plea penned in the previous chapters as legitimate expressions before the throne (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of David</b><p>&#8226; Authorship matters because it roots the text in real history and real covenant relationship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-25.htm">Acts 2:25</a> quotes David to prove Christ&#8217;s resurrection, showing that the credibility of the psalmist undergirds New Testament proclamation.<p>&#8226; David was both king and prophet (<a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>), so labeling these compositions &#8220;of David&#8221; ties regal authority to prophetic insight.<p>&#8226; It also reassures us that God hears leaders and commoners alike, for David&#8217;s words were forged in shepherd fields as well as in palaces (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;71</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Son of Jesse</b><p>&#8226; The title reaches back to humble Bethlehem origins (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), highlighting God&#8217;s pattern of exalting the lowly.<p>&#8226; It links the psalms to the messianic promise: &#8220;A shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning Jesse puts the spotlight on God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness across generations, as <a href="/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a> traces the lineage from Obed to Jesse to David.<p>&#8226; The phrase subtly reminds us that these prayers belong to a family line through which salvation history flows, confirming <a href="/romans/15-12.htm">Romans 15:12</a>, &#8220;The Root of Jesse will appear, One who will arise to rule over the nations; in Him the nations will put their hope.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/72-20.htm">Psalm 72:20</a> is more than a publishing note; it is a Spirit-guided seal. &#8220;Thus&#8221; crowns the preceding praise, &#8220;conclude&#8221; sets a clear boundary, &#8220;the prayers&#8221; elevates the collection as living communion, &#8220;of David&#8221; grounds it in covenant authority, and &#8220;son of Jesse&#8221; traces the lineage of hope that culminates in Christ.
