The "skies" refer to the heavens, often seen as the dwelling place of celestial beings. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the heavens were populated with various deities and spiritual entities. However, this verse asserts that none of these can compare to the LORD, the God of Israel. This echoes the monotheistic belief central to the Hebrew faith, distinguishing it from surrounding polytheistic religions. The rhetorical question underscores God's uniqueness and sovereignty, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, which asks, "To whom then will you liken God?" This theme is consistent throughout the Bible, affirming that no created being, whether angelic or human, can rival God's power and glory.<p><b>Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?</b><br>The "heavenly beings" likely refer to angels or divine council members, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>. In the ancient context, these beings were often considered powerful and majestic, yet the psalmist insists that even they are not comparable to the LORD. This reflects the biblical theme of God's transcendence over all creation, including the spiritual realm. The question reinforces the idea that God is not just another member of a pantheon but is wholly other, unique, and unparalleled. This is further supported by passages such as <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>, which states that Jesus, as the Son of God, is "much superior to the angels," indicating the divine nature and supremacy of God. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ, who, though He took on human form, is exalted above all heavenly beings, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_skies/heavens.htm">The Skies/Heavens</a></b><br>This refers to the celestial realm, often seen as the dwelling place of God and the angels, highlighting the majesty and transcendence of God above all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_beings.htm">Heavenly Beings</a></b><br>These are the celestial entities, possibly angels or other spiritual beings, who are often seen as powerful and majestic but are still incomparable to the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_incomparable_nature.htm">God's Incomparable Nature</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the uniqueness and supremacy of God.

Even at that dizzying height, no rival to the LORD can be found. Think of the heavens as the grand stage of creation&#8212;sun, moon, stars, galaxies, and whatever unseen wonders lie beyond. Yet:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God,&#8221; not the glory of themselves. Creation&#8217;s grandeur only points back to its Creator.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25&#8211;26</a> has God ask, &#8220;To whom will you compare Me? &#8230; Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these?&#8221; Every celestial body is counted and sustained by His power.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a> strengthens the claim: &#8220;For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.&#8221;<p>By asking, &#8220;Who can compare?&#8221; the verse teaches three truths:<p>1. God&#8217;s supremacy is unchallenged. He stands unrivaled in power, wisdom, and majesty.<p>2. God&#8217;s transcendence is literal, not poetic exaggeration. He is above the physical heavens He created.<p>3. Worship must be directed to Him alone; any created marvel&#8212;whether star or planet&#8212;falls infinitely short of His worth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?</b><p>The focus now shifts from the physical heavens to the spiritual realm, the &#8220;heavenly beings&#8221; (angelic hosts). Even here, God&#8217;s uniqueness remains absolute.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> already set the precedent: &#8220;Who among the gods is like You, O LORD&#8212;majestic in holiness?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a> says the Son &#8220;has become as much superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs,&#8221; affirming that even the highest angels serve under divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11&#8211;14</a> pictures myriads of angels around the throne, yet every voice joins in glorifying &#8220;Him who sits on the throne and the Lamb,&#8221; not themselves.<p>The verse highlights:<p>- Angels, though powerful (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20&#8211;21</a>), are created beings who worship, serve, and report to the LORD.<p>- No cherub or seraph, no archangel or heavenly prince shares in God&#8217;s essence.<p>- By underscoring the gap between Creator and creature, the psalm guards us from angel worship (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>) and anchors our faith in the One who alone is worthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a> answers its own questions by exposing the emptiness of every possible rival. Scan the highest skies&#8212;nothing compares. Survey the mightiest angels&#8212;none is like Him. The verse calls us to bow before the incomparable LORD, resting in the certainty that the God who reigns uncontested in heaven also keeps every promise He has made on earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/89.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Sons of the mighty.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">sons of God--i.e., </span>angels.
