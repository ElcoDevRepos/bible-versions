Historically, this can be seen during the time of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when they traveled through territories ruled by various kings. The divine protection ensured that despite being strangers in these lands, they were not subjected to oppression or harm. This protection is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God intervenes to safeguard His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a> when God warns Abimelech in a dream not to harm Abraham or Sarah. This divine intervention underscores God's covenantal faithfulness and His role as a guardian over Israel.<p><b>He rebuked kings on their behalf:</b><br>This phrase highlights specific instances where God directly intervened to protect His people by confronting and correcting rulers. A notable example is found in <a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17-20</a> and <a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3-7</a>, where God afflicts Pharaoh and Abimelech with plagues and dreams, respectively, to prevent them from wronging Abraham and Sarah. These events demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly powers and His willingness to act decisively to uphold His promises. The rebuke of kings also foreshadows the ultimate authority of Christ, the King of Kings, who will judge and rule over all nations. This divine rebuke serves as a reminder of God's power to influence and direct the affairs of nations for the sake of His people, ensuring the fulfillment of His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the protector and defender of His people, ensuring their safety and well-being.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God is protecting.

The psalmist is recounting God&#8217;s dealings with Abraham&#8217;s family while they were &#8220;few in number, &#8230; wandering from nation to nation&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-12.htm">Psalm 105:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Genesis repeatedly shows the Lord stepping in when danger loomed:<p>&#8211; <a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a> records how the Lord &#8220;plagued Pharaoh&#8221; after Abram&#8217;s wife Sarai was taken into Pharaoh&#8217;s house.<p>&#8211; <a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6&#8211;7</a> tells of God warning Abimelech in a dream, keeping him from harming Sarah.<p>&#8211; <a href="/genesis/26-11.htm">Genesis 26:11</a> notes that Abimelech &#8220;warned all the people, saying, &#8216;Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; In each case God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you&#8221;&#8212;is fulfilled literally. No human scheme could overturn His covenant; He personally blocked oppression.<p>&#8226; The same protective hand appears later when Jacob travels: &#8220;The terror of God fell upon the towns all around them, so that no one pursued them&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/35-5.htm">Genesis 35:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> therefore magnifies a God who does not merely sympathize with His people&#8217;s trials; He actively restrains hostile hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He rebuked kings on their behalf</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;He rebuked kings on their behalf&#8221;. God&#8217;s defense escalates from restraining ordinary men to confronting monarchs.<p>&#8226; Pharaoh in Egypt experiences direct rebuke through plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>). Earlier, Pharaoh in Abram&#8217;s day is struck with plagues (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>). Both Pharaohs learn the same lesson: the God of Abraham is not subject to royal decree.<p>&#8226; Abimelech king of Gerar hears God say, &#8220;You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>). That royal household is silenced before harm can be done.<p>&#8226; Centuries later, <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>&#8217;s twin passage in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-21.htm">1 Chronicles 16:21&#8211;22</a> repeats the line to remind Israel that their national history is anchored in a pattern of divine intervention: kings may issue commands, but the Lord overrules.<p>&#8226; This theme continues throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; &#8220;By Me kings reign&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the implication is clear: no earthly authority can thwart the purposes God has for His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a> celebrates God&#8217;s protective faithfulness to the patriarchs.
