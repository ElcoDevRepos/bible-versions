In the context of ancient Israel, cities and nations often faced threats from surrounding enemies. The imagery of passersby plundering indicates a lack of protection and defense, reminiscent of the times when Israel was invaded by foreign powers such as the Babylonians or Assyrians. This can be seen as a consequence of turning away from God, as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>, where disobedience leads to being overrun by enemies. Theologically, it reflects the consequences of sin and the loss of divine favor, which results in exposure to external threats.<p><b>he has become a reproach to his neighbors.</b><br>Being a reproach to neighbors implies a loss of respect and honor. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, honor and shame were significant social values. A nation or individual becoming a reproach would mean they are looked down upon and ridiculed by those around them. This can be connected to the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to shame and dishonor, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14-15</a>. Prophetically, this can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), bearing the reproach of humanity. The suffering servant motif in Isaiah highlights how Jesus took on the shame and reproach of others, ultimately leading to redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, traditionally believed to be a wise man during the time of Solomon, who composed this psalm as a reflection on God's covenant with David and the apparent failure of that promise in light of Israel's suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/davidic_covenant.htm">Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise made by God to King David, ensuring that his descendants would rule Israel forever.

The image is of a city or nation whose protective walls have been flattened (v. 40), leaving it exposed to every passer-by. The Lord had once placed a hedge around His anointed (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20&#8211;23</a>), but because of covenant unfaithfulness that hedge is now gone (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>). The wording echoes <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12 and 2</a>:15, where even casual onlookers gawk at Jerusalem&#8217;s ruin. The point is total vulnerability: when God withdraws His shelter, no human gate or policy can stop the flood of trouble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>plunder him</b><p>The verb pictures looters grabbing what they can without resistance&#8212;much like the Midianites who &#8220;ravaged Israel&#8221; in <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3&#8211;6</a>. The &#8220;him&#8221; is the Davidic king, and by extension the nation he represents. <a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10&#8211;11</a> records a similar confession: &#8220;You have made us turn back from the foe&#8230;You have given us up like sheep to be devoured.&#8221; When divine protection is lifted, plunder follows. The text thus underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: what enemies take, they take only because the Lord has allowed it (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he has become a reproach</b><p>&#8220;Reproach&#8221; signals public humiliation. Once celebrated (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>), the king is now mocked. <a href="/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a> laments, &#8220;We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.&#8221; The honor-shame dynamic common in Scripture means that ridicule is often more painful than physical loss. Here, the reproach is not merely personal; it questions the faithfulness of God&#8217;s covenant promises (<a href="/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>). Yet the psalmist clings to those very promises as grounds for appeal, confident that reproach will not have the last word (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his neighbors</b><p>Mockery comes from those geographically and relationally close&#8212;Edom, Moab, Philistia (<a href="/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4&#8211;8</a>). Friendly ties once secured by David&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1&#8211;14</a>) have turned sour. Neighboring nations see Judah&#8217;s collapse and treat it as confirmation that Yahweh is no longer with His people. This fulfills warnings like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>: &#8220;You will become an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule among all the nations.&#8221; Yet even this serves a redemptive purpose: it prompts the covenant community to renewed repentance and dependence on the Lord who alone can restore their standing (<a href="/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/89-41.htm">Psalm 89:41</a> paints a four-fold picture of covenant discipline: every passer-by can exploit the king, loot freely, mock openly, and spread contempt among surrounding peoples. The verse teaches that when God&#8217;s protective favor is withdrawn, vulnerability, loss, shame, and neighborhood scorn inevitably follow. Yet the larger psalm anchors hope in God&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness to the Davidic covenant, assuring believers that even seasons of reproach are temporary chapters in a story whose final outcome is the vindication of God&#8217;s King and the restoration of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that pass by the way spoil him.</span> This feature of the situation recalls <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, but might, no doubt, suit also other times of distress. <span class="cmt_word">He is a reproach to his neighbours;</span> or, "he <span class="accented">is become</span> a reproach" (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>;
