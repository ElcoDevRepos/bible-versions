The term "rained down" emphasizes the divine origin and abundance of this provision, highlighting God's sovereignty and care for His people. Manna is described in <a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-15</a> as a small, round substance, like frost on the ground, which the Israelites gathered daily. This daily provision required the Israelites to trust in God's continual care and provision, teaching them dependence on Him. The manna is also a type of Christ, as Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>, drawing a parallel between the physical sustenance provided by manna and the spiritual sustenance He offers.<p><b>He gave them grain from heaven.</b><br>The phrase "grain from heaven" further emphasizes the divine origin of manna, distinguishing it from earthly food. This heavenly grain symbolizes God's direct intervention and blessing, providing for the physical needs of His people in a miraculous way. The term "grain" connects to the idea of sustenance and life, as grain is a staple food. In a broader biblical context, this provision prefigures the ultimate provision of Jesus Christ, who is the true bread from heaven. The manna served as a temporary solution to physical hunger, while Christ offers eternal life and spiritual fulfillment. The connection to heaven also underscores the idea that true provision and sustenance come from God alone, reinforcing the theme of divine providence throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine provider who miraculously supplied manna to the Israelites in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness, receiving manna as sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous "grain from heaven" provided by God to sustain the Israelites during their journey through the desert.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, leading to their reliance on God's provision in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God is faithful to provide for our needs, just as He provided manna for the Israelites.
