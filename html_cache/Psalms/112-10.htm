In biblical context, this aligns with the theme of divine justice, where the wicked ultimately face the consequences of their actions. The grief experienced by the wicked is not just emotional but also spiritual, as they recognize their separation from God's favor. This echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>, where the wicked plot against the righteous, but the Lord laughs at them, knowing their day is coming.<p><b>he will gnash his teeth and waste away;</b><br>Gnashing of teeth is a biblical expression of extreme anger or frustration, often associated with the judgment of God. This imagery is used in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>, where it describes the fate of those cast into outer darkness. The phrase "waste away" indicates a gradual decline or destruction, both physically and spiritually. This reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to death, as stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, and highlights the futility of a life lived in opposition to God's will.<p><b>the desires of the wicked will perish.</b><br>The desires of the wicked are often rooted in selfishness, greed, and rebellion against God. This phrase underscores the temporary nature of such desires, contrasting them with the eternal rewards promised to the righteous. In a broader biblical context, this aligns with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The perishing of wicked desires serves as a reminder of the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom and the futility of pursuing worldly gains at the expense of one's soul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents those who live in opposition to God's ways, characterized by their unrighteous actions and desires.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/112.htm">Psalm 112</a> contrasts the wicked with the righteous, who are blessed and favored by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_judgment.htm">The Event of Judgment</a></b><br>The verse implies a moment of realization and judgment where the wicked see the prosperity of the righteous and are filled with grief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_wickedness.htm">The Consequences of Wickedness</a></b><br>The verse serves as a sobering reminder that living in opposition to God's will leads to ultimate disappointment and destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_justice.htm">The Reality of Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is assured, and the wicked will face the consequences of their actions, even if it seems delayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_wicked_desires.htm">The Futility of Wicked Desires</a></b><br>Desires that are not aligned with God's will are ultimately unfulfilling and lead to ruin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_for_the_righteous.htm">Encouragement for the Righteous</a></b><br>The righteous can take comfort in knowing that their faithfulness will be rewarded, and the apparent success of the wicked is temporary.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>This verse can serve as a call for self-examination and repentance for those who may be straying from God's path.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_112_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 112:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_112_10_Fate_of_the_wicked.htm">How does Psalm 112:10 illustrate the fate of the wicked in God's plan?

When the psalmist says, &#8220;The wicked man will see and be grieved,&#8221; the picture is of an evildoer watching God&#8217;s favor rest on those who fear Him (<a href="/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; This reaction is inevitable: &#8220;When the wicked flourish like grass&#8230;they will be destroyed forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>). The prosperity of the righteous exposes the emptiness of wickedness, stirring inner anguish.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; Cain&#8217;s resentment when God accepted Abel&#8217;s offering (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Haman&#8217;s fury at Mordecai&#8217;s honor (<a href="/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8211; The rich man&#8217;s regret as he looks across the gulf to Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assures believers that God vindicates His people publicly; wicked eyes will witness it and feel the sting of conviction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will gnash his teeth and waste away</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He will gnash his teeth&#8221; is a vivid sign of rage and despair. Jesus echoed the phrase to describe the final judgment: &#8220;There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The wicked do not merely lose their composure; they &#8220;waste away.&#8221; Their strength, plans, and influence wither. Compare &#8220;the arm of the wicked will be broken&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-17.htm">Psalm 37:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the progression: emotional pain &#8594; physical expression &#8594; total decline. Sin promises freedom, but ends in decay (<a href="/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, this underscores the futility of envy. God&#8217;s justice will reduce wicked power to nothing, so &#8220;do not fret over evildoers&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the desires of the wicked will perish</b><p>&#8226; Wicked desires are more than passing thoughts; they are the driving ambitions opposed to God. <a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a> says the LORD &#8220;frustrates the plans of the wicked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/10-28.htm">Proverbs 10:28</a> paraphrases <a href="/psalms/112-10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a>: &#8220;The hope of the righteous is gladness, but the expectation of the wicked comes to nothing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment reaches beyond people to their cravings, dreams, and legacies. Every scheme that ignores His law will collapse.<p>&#8226; This truth calls the righteous to view success through eternal lenses. Only what aligns with God&#8217;s will endures (<a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/112-10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a> provides a sober finale to a Psalm about the blessed righteous. The wicked must watch God&#8217;s favor on His people, react with frustrated anger, and ultimately see all their desires disintegrate. The verse reassures believers that justice is certain, encourages patience amid opposition, and reminds all who read it that lasting hope is found only in fearing the LORD and delighting in His commands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/112.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Gnash.</span>--See <a href="/psalms/35-16.htm" title="With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed on me with their teeth.">Psalm 35:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Melt away.</span>--As we say, "Consume with vexation."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/112.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked shall see it, and be grieved</span>.
