The concept of divine judgment is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting God's righteousness and fairness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were often seen as judges, responsible for maintaining justice in their realms. This reflects God's sovereign authority over the entire world. The idea of God judging with justice is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a> and <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>, which affirm that God's judgments are true and righteous. This also points to the eschatological hope of a final judgment where God will set all things right, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation.<p><b>He governs the people with equity.</b><br>This phrase underscores God's fair and impartial rule over humanity. The term "equity" suggests fairness and impartiality, indicating that God's governance is not biased or unjust. In the historical context of ancient Israel, where leaders were often corrupt and partial, this assurance of God's equitable rule would have been a source of comfort and hope. The biblical narrative consistently portrays God as a ruler who cares for the oppressed and marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a> and <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2:1-9</a>. This also foreshadows the messianic reign of Jesus Christ, who is depicted as a just and righteous king in prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>. Jesus' teachings and actions in the Gospels further exemplify this equitable governance, as He ministered to all people, regardless of their social status or background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
