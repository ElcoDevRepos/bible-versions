In the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, God speaks the universe into existence, demonstrating His sovereign control over all creation. The act of speaking to bring about change is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the divine authority and the effectiveness of God's commands.<p><b>and raised a tempest</b><br>The raising of a tempest signifies God's control over nature and His ability to use it for His purposes. In the Bible, storms often symbolize God's power and judgment, as seen in the story of Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>) and the calming of the storm by Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a reminder of God's ability to intervene in the natural world, reflecting His omnipotence.<p><b>that lifted the waves of the sea</b><br>The imagery of the sea and its waves is frequently used in Scripture to represent chaos and danger. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the sea was often seen as a symbol of chaos and disorder. By lifting the waves, God demonstrates His dominion over chaos and His ability to bring order. This can be connected to Jesus walking on water (<a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25-33</a>), where He shows His mastery over the natural elements, further affirming His divine nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the sovereign Creator who commands nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Represents the chaotic and uncontrollable forces of nature, often used in Scripture to symbolize turmoil and danger.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tempest.htm">The Tempest</a></b><br>A powerful storm, illustrating God's control over the natural world and His ability to use it for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God&#8217;s command over the sea and storms reminds us of His ultimate authority over all creation.

Scripture consistently shows that when God speaks, things happen.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>: &#8220;And God said, &#8216;Let there be light,&#8217; and there was light.&#8221; Creation itself responded instantly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>: &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.&#8221;<p>- The same divine word that formed the universe also governs every moment of it. We are reminded that nothing in nature is random; it answers to God&#8217;s direct command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and raised a tempest</b><p>- The &#8220;tempest&#8221; is no mild breeze but a fierce, life-threatening storm. God is not merely allowing the wind&#8212;He is the One who &#8220;raised&#8221; it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>: &#8220;Then the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship was about to break apart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>: &#8220;The LORD has His way in the whirlwind and the storm.&#8221;<p>- This section underlines that the forces we call &#8220;natural disasters&#8221; are still under supernatural supervision.<p>&#8226; Bullet Point Takeaway: God&#8217;s sovereignty extends to what feels chaotic; even the storms are servants of His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that lifted</b><p>- The verb pictures the storm heaving upward, intensifying the sailors&#8217; terror. The motion is vertical&#8212;waves rising higher than the decks.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>: &#8220;He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.&#8221;<p>- God not only initiates the storm; He controls its magnitude, lifting it exactly as high as He intends.<p>&#8226; Practical Note: When circumstances rise beyond our control, they are never beyond God&#8217;s control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the waves of the sea</b><p>- Ancient Israel, like most seafaring cultures, saw the sea as the ultimate picture of untamable power; here, even that power is lifted at God&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37&#8211;39</a>: Jesus rebuked the wind and said to the sea, &#8220;Peace! Be still!&#8221;&#8212;and the sea obeyed. The same voice in <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> now stands in a Galilean boat.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>: &#8220;You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them.&#8221;<p>- The verse invites us to worship: the One who sends the waves can just as easily still them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a> reveals a God whose spoken word commands the storm, intensifies the wind, and lifts the waves. Creation is not independent but responsive to its Maker. For believers, that means every squall&#8212;whether literal or figurative&#8212;arrives only by His permission and under His control. The same voice that sends the tempest also has power to calm it, assuring us of both His sovereignty and His care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/107.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">He commandeth.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">He speaks. </span>The Almighty fiat, as in Genesis 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/107.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15, 18</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>).
