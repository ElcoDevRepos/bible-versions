In biblical context, when God speaks, it is a moment of revelation and assurance. The phrase underscores the importance of listening to God's promises and commands, as they are foundational to faith and practice.<p><b>&#8220;I have made a covenant with My chosen one,</b><br>The concept of a covenant is central to biblical theology, representing a solemn agreement initiated by God. Covenants in the Bible often include promises, conditions, and signs. Here, the "chosen one" refers to David, highlighting God's sovereign choice and the special relationship between God and David. This covenant is part of the Davidic Covenant, which promises an everlasting dynasty, a theme that is crucial throughout the Old Testament and finds fulfillment in the New Testament.<p><b>I have sworn to David My servant:</b><br>Swearing an oath signifies the seriousness and unchangeable nature of God's promise. David is referred to as "My servant," a title of honor that denotes his role as a faithful leader and representative of God's people. This covenant with David is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it establishes the lineage through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would come. The promise to David is reiterated in passages like <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and is seen as a prophecy pointing to the eternal reign of Christ, who is often called the Son of David in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is making a covenant.

Scripture records, &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>). Because God is the speaker, every promise here carries His unchangeable authority (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This personal declaration frames the entire psalm. God is not merely reported; He is quoted. That gives us confidence, just as <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> assures that His word &#8220;will not return to Me empty.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have made a covenant</b><p>&#8226; A covenant is not a casual agreement; it is a binding commitment initiated by God. In <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> the LORD pledges an enduring house and throne to David&#8212;an unconditional promise confirmed here.<p>&#8226; Other verses echo the permanence of divine covenants: &#8220;He remembers His covenant forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness, highlighted in <a href="/psalms/89-1.htm">Psalm 89:1-2</a>, is anchored in this very act of covenant-making.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with My chosen one</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Chosen&#8221; points to God&#8217;s sovereign election. David was selected &#8220;from the sheepfolds&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 12</a>-13).<p>&#8226; Being chosen carries both privilege and purpose. Just as Israel was elected to bless the nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>), David is chosen to establish a royal line culminating in the Messiah (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures every believer: divine choice rests on God&#8217;s grace, not human merit (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have sworn</b><p>&#8226; God backs the covenant with an oath. <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a> notes that God swears so &#8220;the heirs of the promise&#8221; may have strong encouragement.<p>&#8226; An oath from the One who &#8220;cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>) makes the promise doubly certain. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> uses the same formula regarding the eternal priesthood of Christ, underscoring how seriously God treats His pledges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to David My servant</b><p>&#8226; Calling David &#8220;My servant&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>) affirms his humble role under divine authority. The title foreshadows the ultimate Servant-King, Jesus, the &#8220;Son of David&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20-21</a> links David&#8217;s line to the fixed order of day and night&#8212;an illustration of its permanence.<p>&#8226; Through David, God&#8217;s plan for messianic rule unfolds: &#8220;I will establish his line forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4</a>). The promise reaches its fulfillment in Christ&#8217;s resurrection and eternal kingship (<a href="/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29-36</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a> captures God&#8217;s own declaration that He has entered an unbreakable covenant with His specially chosen servant, David. By swearing an oath, the LORD guarantees an everlasting dynasty that finds its ultimate realization in Jesus Christ. The verse reassures us that God&#8217;s spoken word, His covenant commitment, His sovereign choice, and His solemn oath all converge to secure the salvation story He is unfolding for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/89.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I have sworn.</span>--The prophetic passage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) is in the poet's mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made a covenant with my chosen.</span> There is an ellipse of "for thou hast said," which Professor Cheyne supplies.
