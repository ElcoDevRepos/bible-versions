In biblical context, theft is explicitly condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). The act of befriending a thief suggests complicity and a departure from God's law. Historically, Israel was called to be a holy nation, set apart from the practices of surrounding pagan cultures, which often included theft and corruption. This behavior reflects a failure to uphold the covenant relationship with God. Theologically, it underscores the importance of choosing righteous associations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a>, which warns against consenting to sinners.<p><b>and throw in your lot with adulterers</b><br>Adultery is another sin explicitly condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). In ancient Israel, adultery was not only a personal sin but also a social and covenantal violation, as marriage was a reflection of God's covenant with His people. The phrase "throw in your lot" implies active participation and agreement with sinful behavior. Culturally, this reflects a society that has strayed from its foundational values. The prophetic books often use adultery metaphorically to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/hosea/3.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus expands the understanding of adultery to include even lustful thoughts (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>), emphasizing the need for inner purity. This phrase challenges believers to examine their associations and the influence of their companions, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, which warns that bad company corrupts good character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thief.htm">Thief</a></b><br>Represents those who engage in stealing, violating the commandment against theft.
