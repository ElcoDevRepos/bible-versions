The imagery of God rising is often associated with His readiness to act on behalf of His people (<a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>). Zion, representing Jerusalem and by extension the people of Israel, is central to God's covenant promises. Compassion here reflects God's mercy and steadfast love, a recurring theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). Historically, Zion is the hill upon which Jerusalem was built, and it holds significant spiritual importance as the city of David and the location of the Temple. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies God's compassion and fulfills the promises to Zion through His life, death, and resurrection.<p><b>for it is time to show her favor</b><br>The concept of "time" here suggests a divinely appointed moment, often referred to as "kairos" in Greek, which is a time of God's choosing rather than chronological time. This reflects the belief in God's sovereign timing in fulfilling His promises. The favor mentioned is indicative of God's grace and blessing, which is often linked to the restoration and prosperity of His people (<a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). In the context of the Babylonian exile, this would have been understood as a promise of return and rebuilding. Theologically, this can be connected to the New Testament understanding of grace through Jesus Christ, who brings ultimate favor to humanity.<p><b>the appointed time has come</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and fulfillment of God's promises. The "appointed time" suggests a prophetic fulfillment, aligning with the prophetic literature that speaks of a future restoration of Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). It underscores the idea that God's plans are precise and unfold according to His divine schedule. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be linked to the eschatological hope found in Revelation, where God's ultimate plan for redemption and restoration is realized. The appointed time also resonates with the coming of Christ, who fulfills the prophecies and inaugurates the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, Zion is a symbol of God's chosen people and His dwelling place.
