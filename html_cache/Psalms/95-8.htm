In biblical terms, a "hardened heart" signifies stubbornness and resistance to God's will. This concept is frequently addressed in Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, where Pharaoh's heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go. The New Testament also warns against hardening one's heart, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>, which directly references this Psalm. The heart, in biblical anthropology, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. A hardened heart is spiritually dangerous because it leads to disobedience and separation from God.<p><b>as you did at Meribah</b><br>Meribah, meaning "quarreling" or "strife," refers to an event recorded in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a> and <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>, where the Israelites quarreled with Moses due to a lack of water. This location is significant because it represents a moment of testing and rebellion against God. The Israelites' lack of faith and trust in God's provision led to their grumbling and testing of the Lord. This incident is a warning against repeating the mistakes of the past, emphasizing the importance of faith and obedience.<p><b>in the day at Massah</b><br>Massah, meaning "testing," is closely linked with Meribah and is mentioned in the same biblical accounts. The name itself signifies the Israelites' testing of God, questioning His presence and care for them. This event is a critical lesson in the history of Israel, illustrating the consequences of doubt and unbelief. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a> explicitly instructs not to test the Lord as was done at Massah, highlighting the importance of trust and reliance on God's faithfulness.<p><b>in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing and transformation for the Israelites. It is where they wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith, as recounted in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>. The wilderness is both a literal and metaphorical setting, symbolizing trials and the journey of faith. It serves as a backdrop for God's provision and discipline, teaching reliance on Him. The wilderness experience is also a type of the Christian journey, where believers are refined and learn to depend on God, as seen in Jesus' own time in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/meribah.htm">Meribah</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord by demanding water, leading to Moses striking the rock to bring forth water (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/massah.htm">Massah</a></b><br>Another name for the same event at Meribah, emphasizing the testing of God by the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who was instructed by God to bring water from the rock at Meribah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness, often struggling with faith and obedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, a place of testing and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_hardness_of_heart.htm">Guard Against Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Believers are called to remain sensitive and responsive to God's voice, avoiding the stubbornness that characterized the Israelites at Meribah.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_testing_god.htm">The Danger of Testing God</a></b><br>Testing God reflects a lack of trust and can lead to spiritual consequences.
