In the context of ancient Israel, decrees were often associated with royal pronouncements or legal edicts, underscoring the solemnity and binding nature of what follows. The speaker, traditionally understood as the anointed king, is relaying a message directly from God, highlighting the intimate relationship between the divine and the king. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king was seen as God's representative on earth.<p><b>You are My Son;</b><br>This phrase is central to the understanding of the king's relationship with God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were often considered sons of gods, but in Israel, this was uniquely tied to the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The term "Son" signifies a special status, indicating both a position of favor and a role as a representative of God's authority. This phrase is also seen as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is recognized in the New Testament as the Son of God, fulfilling this declaration in a fuller sense (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>).<p><b>today I have become Your Father.</b><br>The word "today" signifies a specific moment of divine action or recognition. In the historical context, this could refer to the day of the king's coronation, when he is publicly acknowledged as God's chosen ruler. The phrase "I have become Your Father" indicates a formal establishment of the relationship, akin to adoption, where the king is granted the rights and responsibilities of a son. In the New Testament, this is seen as a reference to the resurrection of Jesus, where He is declared the Son of God with power (<a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>, <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>), marking a new phase in the divine plan of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who speaks the decree.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed.htm">The Anointed (Messiah)</a></b><br>The one to whom the decree is spoken, identified as God's Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (Implied Author)</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of the psalm, representing the kingly line.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which the king reigns, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_kings.htm">Nations and Kings</a></b><br>The earthly rulers and peoples who are in opposition to God's anointed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sonship.htm">Divine Sonship</a></b><br>Recognize the unique relationship between God and His Anointed, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Understand that Jesus, as the Son, holds ultimate authority over all creation, including earthly rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereign plan, which is fulfilled through His Son, despite opposition from worldly powers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, find our identity in Christ, the Son, and live as children of God, reflecting His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_the_decree.htm">Proclaiming the Decree</a></b><br>Be bold in proclaiming the truth of Jesus' divine sonship and His role as the Savior and King.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_7_Jesus_divine_sonship.htm">How does Psalm 2:7 reveal Jesus' divine sonship and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_You_are_My_Son_for_Jesus.htm">What does "You are My Son" signify about Jesus' relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_7_and_Hebrews_1_5_link.htm">How does Psalm 2:7 connect with Hebrews 1:5 regarding Christ's supremacy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Jesus_as_God_s_Son_on_faith.htm">How can acknowledging Jesus as God's Son impact your daily faith walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_2_7_clarify_the_Trinity.htm">In what ways can Psalm 2:7 strengthen your understanding of the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Psalm_2_7_s_father-son_bond.htm">What does "You are My Son; today I have become Your Father" signify in Psalm 2:7?

The verse, echoed repeatedly in the New Testament, anchors our confidence that Jesus is God&#8217;s appointed, resurrected, reigning Son whose rule will never fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">I will declare.</span>--The anointed king now speaks himself, recalling the covenant made with him by Jehovah at his coronation.<p><span class= "bld">I will tell.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Let me speak concerning the appointment. </span>The word rendered <span class= "ital">decree </span>in our version is derived from a root meaning to engrave, and so stands for any formal agreement, but it is usually an ordinance clearly announced by a prophet or some other commissioned interpreter of the Divine will, and consecrated and legalised by mutual adoption by king and people.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord hath.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Jehovah said unto me: </span>that is, at that particular time, the day which the great event made the new birthday, as it were, of the monarch, or perhaps of the monarchy. From the particular prince, of whose career, if we could identify him with certainty, this would be the noblest historical memorial, the Psalmist--if, indeed, any one historic personage was in his thought at all--let his thoughts and hopes range, as we certainly may, on to a larger and higher fulfilment. The figure of an <span class= "ital">ideal prince </span>who was always about to appear, but was never realised in any actual successor on the throne, may possibly, by the time of this psalm, have assumed its great place in the nation's prophetic hopes. Certainly the whole line of tradition claims the passage in a Messianic sense.

It is best to suppose that Messiah here takes the word, and maintains it to the end of ver. 9, when the psalmist resumes in his own person.
