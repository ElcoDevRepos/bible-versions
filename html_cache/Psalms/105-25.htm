In the biblical narrative, God is often seen as the one who can harden or soften hearts according to His divine purposes (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>, <a href="/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>). This reflects the belief that God can use even the opposition of others to fulfill His plans, as seen in the story of Pharaoh during the Exodus.<p><b>to hate His people</b><br>The hatred towards God's people, Israel, is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This animosity can be traced back to the enmity between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Edom), as well as other surrounding nations. Historically, the Israelites faced opposition from various groups, including the Egyptians, Philistines, and Babylonians. This hatred is often portrayed as part of the spiritual battle between God's chosen people and the forces of evil.<p><b>to conspire against His servants</b><br>The conspiracy against God's servants suggests a deliberate and organized effort to undermine or destroy them. This can be seen in various biblical accounts, such as the plots against Joseph by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18-20</a>) and against Daniel by the satraps (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-9</a>). In a broader sense, this reflects the ongoing spiritual warfare against those who serve God, a theme that continues into the New Testament with the persecution of the early church (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this opposition is seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who faced conspiracy and betrayal leading to His crucifixion, yet through it, God's redemptive plan was accomplished.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign orchestrator of events, who turns the hearts of people according to His divine plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people whose hearts were turned to hate the Israelites, leading to their oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were enslaved in Egypt and later delivered by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God's servants who were sent to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were delivered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, even the hearts of people, to fulfill His divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_in_adversity.htm">Purpose in Adversity</a></b><br>Understand that God can use difficult circumstances, such as the Israelites' oppression, to bring about His greater plan of deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Trust that even when situations seem dire, God is working behind the scenes for the good of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_for_leaders.htm">Intercession for Leaders</a></b><br>Pray for the hearts of leaders and those in authority, knowing that God can turn their hearts according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>Like Moses and Aaron, be faithful in serving God, even when facing opposition or hatred.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_105_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 105:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_25_God_s_control_over_hearts.htm">How does Psalm 105:25 illustrate God's sovereignty over human hearts and actions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_divine-induced_enmity.htm">What lessons can we learn from God turning hearts to hate His people?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_1_8-14_Psalm_105_25.htm">How does Exodus 1:8-14 connect with the events in Psalm 105:25?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_trust_God_s_plan.htm">In what ways can believers trust God's plan despite opposition, as seen here?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_control_to_daily_life.htm">How can we apply the understanding of God's control in our daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_25_God_s_love_and_justice.htm">How does Psalm 105:25 align with God's nature of love and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_harden_hearts_in_Psalm_105.htm">Why would God harden hearts according to Psalm 105:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_Psalm_105_25.htm">What historical context explains the events in Psalm 105:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_105.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 105?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_christian_socialism.htm">Are you overly sensitive?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_folly.htm">What does the Bible say about foolishness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_reject_and_defeat_his_people.htm">(Psalm 44:9-10) Why would a supposedly omnipotent and loving God suddenly reject His people and allow them to be defeated in battle?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/bible_miracle_examples.htm">What does the Bible teach about hate?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 105:25 Mean</div><b>Whose hearts He turned</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;He&#8221; points to the LORD as the active subject.
