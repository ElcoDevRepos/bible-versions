The concept of a covenant is central to the biblical narrative, beginning with God's covenant with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9-17</a>) and extending through His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), Moses (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The idea of God remembering His covenant is not about recalling something forgotten but about His active commitment to fulfill His promises. This is seen in the New Testament as well, where the new covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>) is the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The eternal nature of God's covenant assures believers of His unchanging nature and reliability (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><b>the word He ordained for a thousand generations&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the enduring and authoritative nature of God's word. The term "ordained" suggests a deliberate and sovereign act of God, establishing His word as binding and unchangeable. The reference to "a thousand generations" is a hyperbolic expression indicating an immeasurable duration, underscoring the perpetual relevance and application of God's promises. This connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, which speaks of God's faithfulness to those who love Him and keep His commandments. The continuity of God's word is further affirmed in the New Testament, where Jesus states that His words will never pass away (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>). This phrase reassures believers of the timeless truth and reliability of God's promises, which are ultimately fulfilled in Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who remembers His covenant.
