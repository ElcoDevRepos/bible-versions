The term "ascents" reflects both the physical journey up to Jerusalem, which is situated on a hill, and the spiritual elevation experienced during worship. The ascent can also symbolize the spiritual journey of believers toward God.<p><b>When the LORD restored the captives of Zion,</b><br>This phrase refers to the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylonian captivity, a pivotal event in Israel's history. The restoration was seen as a divine act, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28-45</a>:1. Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, represents the spiritual and political heart of Israel. The restoration signifies God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His power to redeem His people. It also prefigures the ultimate restoration through Christ, who liberates humanity from the captivity of sin.<p><b>we were like dreamers.</b><br>The return from exile was so miraculous and joyous that it felt like a dream to the Israelites. This expression captures the overwhelming sense of disbelief and joy at witnessing God's deliverance. It echoes the theme of divine intervention found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>, where God restores fortunes beyond expectation. The dream-like state can also be seen as a type of the future hope and joy believers will experience in the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is central to the restoration and redemption of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/captives_of_zion.htm">Captives of Zion</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were in exile, likely in Babylon, and experienced a miraculous return to their homeland.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term often used to describe Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel, representing God's presence and promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The act of God bringing His people back from captivity, symbolizing renewal and fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dreamers.htm">Dreamers</a></b><br>The Israelites' reaction to their unexpected and joyous return, as if it were too good to be true.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, and His timing is perfect.

On the other hand, the usual rendering suggests that the news of the restoration appeared too good to be true. "Surely you are dreaming" is a common saying. An illustration has been aptly produced in Livy's description of the feelings of the Greeks when they heard at the Isthmian games (B.C. 196), after the defeat of the Macedonians by T. Flaminius, the proclamation of the herald that they should, by the free gift of the Roman people, retain their liberty. "The joy was too great for men to take it all in.
