In biblical times, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet the rich were also warned against pride and self-reliance (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). The imagery of feasting and worship indicates a celebration and recognition of God's sovereignty. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of the Messianic kingdom where all, regardless of status, will honor God (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>). The inclusion of the rich highlights the universal scope of God's reign, transcending social and economic barriers.<p><b>all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him&#8212;</b><br>This phrase refers to mortality and the inevitability of death, as "dust" is a common biblical metaphor for the grave (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). It emphasizes that all humanity, regardless of status, will ultimately acknowledge God's authority. Kneeling is a posture of submission and reverence, indicating that even in death, God's dominion is recognized. This can be connected to <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Christ. It underscores the theme of God's ultimate victory over death and the universal acknowledgment of His lordship.<p><b>even those unable to preserve their lives.</b><br>This part highlights human frailty and the inability to escape death, a common theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-9</a>). It underscores the idea that all people, regardless of their efforts or status, are subject to God's authority. This can be seen as a humbling reminder of human limitations and the need for reliance on God. In a Messianic context, it points to the hope of resurrection and eternal life through Christ, who conquered death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>). It reflects the biblical truth that life is ultimately in God's hands, and true preservation comes through faith in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_of_the_earth.htm">The Rich of the Earth</a></b><br>This phrase refers to those who are wealthy or influential in worldly terms.

This anticipates the day when &#8220;kings of the earth&#8221; bring their splendor to the Lord&#8217;s city (<a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>). No level of success exempts anyone from bowing to the Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will feast and worship</b><p>Feasting implies joyful fellowship, not mere obligation. <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a> describes the LORD preparing &#8220;a banquet of aged wine&#8221; for all peoples; <a href="/matthew/22-1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a> echoes this with the wedding supper. Worship follows the feast&#8212;gratitude spilling over into adoration. What begins as celebration becomes devotion as every blessing is traced back to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All who go down to the dust</b><p>The phrase embraces the frail, the dying, and ultimately every human (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). <a href="/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a> reminds us that &#8220;all flesh would perish together.&#8221; David broadens the vision: from boardrooms to sickbeds, every mortal stands under the same call to honor God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will kneel before Him</b><p>Kneeling signals submission. <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> promises &#8220;every knee should bow&#8230; in heaven and on earth and under the earth.&#8221; Whether willingly in this life or compelled in judgment, every person will acknowledge Jesus&#8217; lordship. The psalm looks ahead to that universal recognition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even those unable to preserve their lives</b><p>Those &#8220;without strength&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>) are not forgotten.

The mention of the "fat upon earth," as included in this feast, seems certainly out of place, and injures the parallelism.

The Christian feast is not for the poor and needy only, like Jewish sacrificial feasts, but for the "fat ones" of the earth as well - the rich and prosperous. As Hengstenberg observes, "This great spiritual feast is not unworthy of the presence even of those who live in the greatest abundance: it contains a costly viand, which all their plenty cannot give - a viand for which even the satisfied are hungry; and, on the other hand, the most needy and most miserable are not excluded" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 396). <span class="cmt_word">All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all mortal men what-soever - all that are on their way to the tomb - shall bow before Christ, either willingly as his worshippers, or unwillingly as his conquered enemies, made to lick the dust at his feet. <span class="cmt_word">And none can keep alive his own soul</span>. Life is Christ's gift; the soul cannot be kept alive except through <span class="accented">him</span>, by his quickening Spirit (<a href="/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53, 63</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/22-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the rich</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#353;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1879.htm">Strong's 1879: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fat, rich, fertile</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will feast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1452;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and worship;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;
