In the context of ancient Israel, the "gates" refer to the entrance of the Temple in Jerusalem, where the Israelites would come to offer sacrifices and worship. Thanksgiving was a central aspect of worship, reflecting an acknowledgment of God's provision and blessings. The act of entering with thanksgiving signifies a readiness to honor God, recognizing His sovereignty and goodness. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>, which encourages believers to present their requests to God with thanksgiving.<p><b>and His courts with praise;</b><br>The "courts" refer to the outer areas of the Temple where people gathered to worship. Praise is an expression of admiration and reverence for God's character and deeds. In the historical context, the Temple was the focal point of Jewish worship, and entering its courts with praise was a communal act of acknowledging God's majesty. This practice is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to continually offer a "sacrifice of praise" (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>). The emphasis on praise highlights the importance of recognizing God's holiness and power.<p><b>give thanks to Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of gratitude in the believer's relationship with God. Giving thanks is not merely a ritualistic act but a heartfelt response to God's faithfulness and mercy. In the cultural context of the Psalms, thanksgiving was often expressed through psalms, hymns, and offerings. The call to give thanks is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, which instructs believers to give thanks in all circumstances. This attitude of gratitude is foundational to a life of worship and devotion.<p><b>and bless His name.</b><br>To "bless His name" means to honor and exalt God's character and reputation. In biblical times, a name was more than just an identifier; it represented the essence and attributes of a person. Blessing God's name involves acknowledging His holiness, righteousness, and love. This act of blessing is a form of worship that aligns with the first petition of the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be Your name" (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). It reflects a deep reverence for God and a desire to see His name glorified among all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is expressing a call to worship and gratitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates_and_courts.htm">Gates and Courts</a></b><br>Symbolic references to the temple in Jerusalem, representing the presence of God and the place of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of the Psalm, called to worship and thank God for His faithfulness and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context in which the Psalm was likely used, involving rituals and sacrifices as acts of worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_attitude_of_gratitude.htm">The Attitude of Gratitude</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of thankfulness as a daily practice, recognizing God's goodness and faithfulness in all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/entering_god's_presence.htm">Entering God's Presence</a></b><br>Approach God with reverence and joy, understanding that thanksgiving and praise are keys to experiencing His presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/blessing_god's_name.htm">Blessing God's Name</a></b><br>Acknowledge and honor God's character and deeds, making it a habit to speak well of Him in all situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>Engage in corporate worship as a vital expression of faith, joining with others to celebrate and give thanks to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discipline.htm">Spiritual Discipline</a></b><br>Develop the discipline of thanksgiving and praise as a spiritual practice that transforms our perspective and aligns us with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_100_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 100:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Enter_His_gates_with_thanks_daily.htm">How can we "enter His gates with thanksgiving" in our daily prayers?

It is not optional courtesy; it is the heart&#8217;s confession that God has acted graciously and faithfully. When Israel recalled the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>) or the manna (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>), gratitude was the fitting response.<p>- New-covenant believers likewise &#8220;draw near with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>) because Christ has opened &#8220;a new and living way&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>). Gratitude anchors us in that finished work, protecting us from entitlement and forgetfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>- Practically, thanksgiving can be as simple as naming God&#8217;s daily mercies:<p>&#8226; Salvation itself (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-7</a>)<p>&#8226; Provision of needs (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>)<p>&#8226; Fellowship of other believers (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and His courts with praise</b><p>- Moving from gates to courts signals deeper access&#8212;no longer at the perimeter but inside the place of ministry. Praise lifts our eyes from gifts to the Giver: &#8220;Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>).<p>- Praise is vocal, joyful, public. The very structure of the psalm (&#8220;make a joyful noise,&#8221; verse 1) rules out silent, detached religiosity. God &#8220;inhabits the praises of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>), so praise aligns us with heaven&#8217;s ongoing chorus (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-14</a>).<p>- Praise also re-centers our hearts when circumstances press hard. Paul and Silas sang in prison (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>); Jehoshaphat&#8217;s choir led Israel&#8217;s army (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21-22</a>). Praise is spiritual warfare because it declares God&#8217;s supremacy over every foe.<p>- Ways to cultivate praise:<p>&#8226; Sing Scripture-saturated songs (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>)<p>&#8226; Speak God&#8217;s attributes out loud&#8212;His holiness, love, justice, immutability (<a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1-5</a>)<p>&#8226; Testify to others about answered prayer (<a href="/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9-10</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>give thanks to Him and bless His name</b><p>- The verse circles back, doubling down on gratitude and adding &#8220;bless His name.&#8221; To bless God is to speak well of Him, declaring His reputation true. It is the creature&#8217;s joyful acknowledgment that the Creator lacks nothing yet delights in our praise.<p>- Scripture consistently weds thanksgiving and blessing: &#8220;I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>), &#8220;In everything give thanks&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; represents His revealed character&#8212;Yahweh who keeps covenant love (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). Blessing His name means rehearsing those perfections until our hearts rest secure.<p>- Practical outflow:<p>&#8226; Speak blessings in private prayer and in public gatherings (<a href="/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Refuse grumbling; instead reinterpret trials as arenas for God&#8217;s sufficiency (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14-15</a>)<p>&#8226; End each day by naming specific ways God displayed His character&#8212;faithfulness in temptation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>), wisdom in guidance (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>), constancy in His promises (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a> calls God&#8217;s people to approach Him deliberately&#8212;first with thankful hearts that recall His acts, then with praise that exalts His character, and finally with sustained thanksgiving that blesses His unchanging name. The verse sketches a movement from outer gates to inner courts, illustrating ever-deepening communion secured for us in Christ. Practiced daily, this pattern safeguards us from ingratitude, fuels our joy, and magnifies the Lord who is forever worthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/100.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Enter into his gates with</span> <span class="cmt_word">thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise.</span> The mention of" gates" and" courts" points primarily to the temple worship, but the reference may be, as Professor Alexander suggests, "typical or metaphorical" rather than literal, and may extend to all the faithful and to all places of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Be thankful unto him;</span> or, <span class="accented">give thanks unto him</span> (Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And bless his Name</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/96-2.htm">Psalm 96:2</a>;
