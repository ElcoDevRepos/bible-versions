The act of rebuking the sea is reminiscent of Jesus calming the storm in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), demonstrating divine authority over nature. The Red Sea event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. The term "rebuked" suggests a command that enforces order, similar to how God rebukes chaos and brings about His will. This event is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people, showcasing His faithfulness and might.<p><b>and it dried up;</b><br>The drying up of the Red Sea is a miraculous intervention, emphasizing God's control over natural elements. This act is not just a natural phenomenon but a divine intervention that allowed the Israelites to escape Pharaoh's army. The drying of the sea is symbolic of God's ability to make a way where there seems to be none, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>. Archaeological studies have sought to locate the crossing site, with some suggesting the Gulf of Suez or the Gulf of Aqaba, though the exact location remains uncertain.<p><b>He led them through the depths</b><br>This phrase underscores God's guidance and protection. The "depths" refer to the sea's formidable waters, which God transformed into a safe passage. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to depict God's deliverance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism, representing the transition from slavery to freedom, from death to life, prefiguring Christian baptism as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>.<p><b>as through a desert.</b><br>The comparison to a desert highlights the ease and safety with which the Israelites crossed the sea. A desert, though barren, is traversable, unlike the chaotic and life-threatening sea. This imagery reinforces the miraculous nature of the event, as God transformed a perilous situation into a secure path. The desert also symbolizes a place of testing and reliance on God, as seen in the Israelites' subsequent journey through the wilderness, where they learned to depend on God's provision and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and authority over nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>A significant body of water that God miraculously parted to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian pursuit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, whom He led out of slavery in Egypt and through the Red Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, who pursued them to the Red Sea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, through whom God performed the miracle of parting the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>The parting of the Red Sea illustrates God's absolute control over the natural world.

It means solid footing, no muddy slog. When Joshua later led Israel across the Jordan, the river likewise &#8220;stood still&#8230; and all Israel crossed on dry ground&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16-17</a>). God consistently provides not just escape but a sure path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He led them through the depths</b><p>- <a href="/exodus/14-22.htm">Exodus 14:22</a> records that &#8220;the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.&#8221; What looked like certain death became a highway.<p>- <a href="/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a> celebrates the same act: &#8220;You divided the sea before them, and they passed through it on dry ground,&#8221; showing God&#8217;s ongoing commitment to shepherd His people.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13-14</a> pictures the Spirit leading them &#8220;like cattle going down to the pasture,&#8221; emphasizing tender guidance even in terrifying surroundings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as through a desert.</b><p>- A desert is spacious, exposed, and obstacle-free. That is exactly how safe and straightforward the seabed became. <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> reflects on the moment: &#8220;Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a> connects the imagery: &#8220;This is what the LORD says&#8212;He who makes a way in the sea and a path through surging waters.&#8221; For Israel, the &#8220;depths&#8221; were no more threatening than flat wilderness terrain.<p>- In later wilderness wanderings, God again proved able to supply water in arid places (<a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>), highlighting that whether He removes water or provides it, His people can trust His provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> celebrates a literal, historic event&#8212;the parting of the Red Sea&#8212;while spotlighting timeless truths: God speaks with absolute authority over creation, alters circumstances instantaneously, leads His people personally, and turns the most daunting obstacles into safe passageways.
