In the Old Testament, the "angel of the LORD" is sometimes seen as a theophany, a visible manifestation of God. This figure appears in various significant moments, such as with Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>, Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, and Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>. The presence of the angel of the LORD often signifies divine intervention and protection.<p><b>encamps around</b><br>The imagery of encamping suggests a military or protective stance, indicating a readiness to defend. In ancient times, armies would encamp around a city or a person to provide security. This phrase implies a continuous and vigilant protection, much like a shepherd watching over his flock. It evokes the idea of God&#8217;s constant presence and safeguarding of His people.<p><b>those who fear Him</b><br>"Fear" in this context refers to a reverential awe and respect for God, acknowledging His power and authority. This fear is not about being afraid but about honoring God and living in obedience to His will. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," highlighting the importance of this attitude in a believer's life. Those who fear God are promised His protection and guidance.<p><b>and he delivers them</b><br>Deliverance is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with God saving His people from danger or oppression. This deliverance can be physical, as seen in the Exodus story, or spiritual, as in the salvation offered through Jesus Christ. The promise of deliverance is a reassurance of God&#8217;s faithfulness and His ability to rescue His people from any peril. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and salvation, culminating in the work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after being delivered from danger.

David is not speaking of a mere created angel but of the divine Messenger who appears throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; In <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7&#8211;13</a> the Angel of the LORD speaks as God to Hagar.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2&#8211;6</a> He appears to Moses from the burning bush and identifies Himself as &#8220;the God of your father.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12&#8211;14</a> He commissions Gideon, speaking with divine authority.<p>The consistent pattern shows the Angel of the LORD exercising God&#8217;s own prerogatives&#8212;receiving worship, forgiving sins, promising salvation. Many see here the pre-incarnate Christ, personally engaged in the lives of His people long before Bethlehem (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>). The verse, then, begins by assuring us that God Himself comes near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Encamps</b><p>&#8220;Encamps&#8221; paints a military picture of pitching tents all around a location, forming an unbroken perimeter.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> echoes this: &#8220;As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a> adds, &#8220;I will camp around My house as a guard.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When Elisha&#8217;s servant panicked, God opened his eyes to see &#8220;the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>The imagery reassures believers of a constant, vigilant presence. God is not a distant observer; He pitches His own tent right where we live, standing watch day and night.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Around those who fear Him</b><p>The promise is specific: it belongs &#8220;to those who fear Him.&#8221; This fear is not terror that drives away but reverence that draws near&#8212;an attitude of humble trust and obedience.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a> says, &#8220;The LORD confides in those who fear Him; He reveals His covenant to them&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a> links fear with security: &#8220;He who fears the LORD has a secure fortress.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> describes Cornelius as &#8220;a devout man and one who feared God&#8230; and God remembered him.&#8221;<p>To fear the Lord is to treat Him as ultimate, yielding every corner of life to His authority.

From comparison with other passages it may be (1) any commissioned agent of God, as a prophet (<a href="/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a>). (2) One of the celestial court (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.">Genesis 22:11</a>). (3) Any manifestation of the Divine presence, as the flame in the bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a>), the winds (<a href="/context/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>). (4) Jehovah Himself, as in the phrase "the angel of his presence" (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>). It may very well be, therefore, that the psalmist uses it here in a general sense for the Divine manifestation of protection. We thus avoid the difficulty in the image of <span class= "ital">one </span>angel encamping round the sufferer, which other commentators try to avoid by supposing <span class= "ital">angel </span>to mean either a <span class= "ital">troop </span>of angels, or <span class= "ital">captain </span>or <span class= "ital">chief </span>of an angelic army. But for this difficulty, we should connect the psalmist's words immediately with the well-known incident in Jacob's life at Mahanaim, or with the story of Elisha and "the horses and chariots of fire" round about him. We certainly must not let go the beautiful thought that round God's elect-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them</span>. According to some commentators (Rosenmuller, 'Four Friends,' and others), the expression, "angel of the Lord," is here used as a collective, and means the angels generally. With this certainly agrees the statement that the angel "encampeth <span class="accented">round about</span> them that fear him;" and the illustration from <a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14-18</a> is thus exactly apposite. But others deny that "the angel of the Lord" has ever a collective sense, and think a single personality must necessarily* be intended, which they regard as identical with "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>), and "the angel of the Lord's presence" spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>); so Kay, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Professor Alexander, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' When pressed to say how this one angel can "encamp round" a number of persons, they reply that, of course, he has his subordinates with him - a "spangled host," that "keep watch in squadrons bright;" and that he is said to do what they do, which is no doubt quite in accordance with ordinary modes of speech. Thus, however, the two expositions become nearly identical, since, according to both, it is the angelic host which "encamps around" the faithful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/34-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1427;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">encamps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2583.htm">Strong's 2583: </a> </span><span class="str2">To incline, to decline, to pitch a, tent, gen, to encamp</span><br /><br /><span class="word">around</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1432;&#1489;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5439.htm">Strong's 5439: </a> </span><span class="str2">A circle, neighbour, environs, around</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those who fear Him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
