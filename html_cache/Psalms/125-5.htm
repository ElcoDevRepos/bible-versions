In biblical context, "crooked ways" often symbolize moral and spiritual corruption, contrasting with the straight and narrow path of God's commandments (<a href="/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>). The imagery of a crooked path is used throughout Scripture to describe those who choose sin over obedience (<a href="/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>). Historically, Israel faced many temptations to follow the practices of surrounding pagan nations, which often led them away from God's laws. This serves as a warning against apostasy and the consequences of turning away from God's truth.<p><b>the LORD will banish with the evildoers.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes divine justice. The LORD's action of banishing reflects His role as a righteous judge who separates the wicked from the righteous (<a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5-6</a>). The term "evildoers" is frequently used in the Psalms to describe those who oppose God's will and oppress His people (<a href="/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>). The concept of banishment can be linked to the ultimate judgment where the unrighteous are separated from God's presence (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>). This also echoes the fate of those who reject God's covenant, as seen in the history of Israel's exile due to disobedience.<p><b>Peace be upon Israel.</b><br>This concluding phrase is a blessing and a prayer for the well-being of God's chosen people. "Peace" (shalom in Hebrew) encompasses not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of wholeness, prosperity, and harmony with God. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel's peace is contingent upon their faithfulness to God's covenant (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-6</a>). This blessing is prophetic, pointing to the ultimate peace brought by the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). It also connects to the New Testament promise of peace for those who are in Christ (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is just and righteous in His judgments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/evildoers.htm">Evildoers</a></b><br>Those who act wickedly and oppose God's righteous ways.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, representing His people who are called to live in obedience to Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_turn_aside.htm">Those who turn aside</a></b><br>Individuals who deviate from the path of righteousness and follow sinful ways.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crooked_ways.htm">Crooked ways</a></b><br>Symbolic of sinful, deceitful, and unrighteous paths that lead away from God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deviating_from_righteousness.htm">The Danger of Deviating from Righteousness</a></b><br>Turning aside to crooked ways leads to separation from God and His blessings.<br><br>The path of righteousness requires steadfastness and commitment to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_judgment.htm">God's Justice and Judgment</a></b><br>God will judge those who choose crooked paths alongside evildoers.<br><br>His justice ensures that righteousness is upheld and wickedness is punished.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_peace_for_the_faithful.htm">The Promise of Peace for the Faithful</a></b><br>True peace is promised to those who remain faithful to God and His ways.<br><br>Israel, as God's people, symbolizes the peace and security found in obedience to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_self-examination.htm">The Call to Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to examine their paths and ensure alignment with God's righteousness.<br><br>Repentance and realignment with God's ways are necessary for those who have strayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_to_persevere_in_faith.htm">Encouragement to Persevere in Faith</a></b><br>Despite challenges, believers are called to persevere in faith and righteousness.<br><br>Trust in God's promises and His ultimate justice provides strength and hope.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_125_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 125:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_125_5_s_warning_on_crooked_ways.htm">How does Psalm 125:5 warn against turning to "crooked ways" in life?
