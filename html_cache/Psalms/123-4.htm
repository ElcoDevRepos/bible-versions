The term "scorn" indicates a deep-seated disdain, which the Israelites endured from those who were self-sufficient and dismissive of God's chosen people. Historically, Israel was surrounded by powerful empires such as Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, which often looked down on them. This scorn can be seen in the mocking of the Israelites during their captivity and exile. Biblically, this echoes the experiences of figures like Nehemiah, who faced ridicule from Sanballat and Tobiah (<a href="/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3</a>). Theologically, this scorn can be seen as a test of faith, where the faithful are called to endure and trust in God's deliverance.<p><b>much contempt from the proud</b><br>The "contempt" mentioned here is a stronger form of disdain, suggesting a dismissive attitude that the proud have towards those they consider inferior. In the biblical context, the "proud" often refers to those who rely on their own strength and wisdom rather than on God. This is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and Proverbs, where pride is consistently condemned (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The proud are often contrasted with the humble, who find favor with God (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). In a prophetic sense, this contempt can be seen as a foreshadowing of the rejection and scorn that Jesus Christ would endure from the religious leaders and the Roman authorities, who were proud in their own understanding and power. This phrase calls believers to remain steadfast in the face of contempt, trusting in God's ultimate justice and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/123.htm">Psalm 123</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who expresses a communal lament and plea for mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrogant.htm">The Arrogant</a></b><br>Individuals or groups who display pride and disdain towards others, often seen as oppressors or those in positions of power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proud.htm">The Proud</a></b><br>Similar to the arrogant, these are people who hold themselves in high regard, often looking down on others with contempt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often represented in the Psalms, experiencing oppression and seeking God's deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned, the context of communal prayer and lament often points to the Temple as a place of seeking God's presence and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_faith.htm">Endurance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to endure scorn and contempt with patience, trusting in God's ultimate justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_vs._pride.htm">Humility vs. Pride</a></b><br>The contrast between the humble and the proud is a central biblical theme, encouraging believers to seek humility and avoid arrogance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_mercy.htm">Seeking God's Mercy</a></b><br>In times of distress and oppression, turning to God in prayer and seeking His mercy is a vital response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_lament.htm">Community Lament</a></b><br>The communal aspect of the Psalm reminds us of the importance of supporting one another in prayer and shared burdens.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_justice.htm">Hope in God's Justice</a></b><br>Despite enduring scorn, believers can have hope in God's promise to humble the proud and exalt the humble.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_123_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 123:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Responding_to_contempt_in_Psalm_123_4.htm">How can we respond to "contempt" from others as seen in Psalm 123:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_4_Endure_scorn_humbly.htm">What does Psalm 123:4 teach about enduring scorn with a humble heart?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_4_Matthew_5_11_link.htm">How does Psalm 123:4 connect with Jesus' teachings on persecution in Matthew 5:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_prayer_aid_against_ridicule.htm">In what ways can prayer help us handle "ridicule" mentioned in Psalm 123:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_4_s_lesson_on_facing_disdain.htm">How can Psalm 123:4 guide us in dealing with societal disdain today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_4_on_contempt_from_pride.htm">How does Psalm 123:4 address the issue of contempt from the proud and arrogant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_123_4.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 123:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_4_Humility_amid_scorn.htm">How does Psalm 123:4 reflect the theme of humility in the face of scorn?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_123.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 123?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_123_4_conflict_with_other_verses.htm">Psalm 123:4 laments the scorn of the proud; does this conflict with other verses implying the righteous should not be shaken by contempt? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_mocking_god.htm">What is the meaning of mocking God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_no_evidence_for_psalm_123_3's_plea.htm">Why is there no clear historical or archaeological evidence for the specific event behind Psalm 123:3's plea for mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_hell_eternal_(matt_25_46_vs_mal_4_1).htm">Is hell eternal?
