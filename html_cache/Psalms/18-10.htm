They are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, guarding the way to the Tree of Life. In <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, cherubim are part of the design of the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's throne and His divine presence. The imagery of God mounting a cherub suggests His sovereign power and swift intervention. This phrase emphasizes God's ability to transcend the natural world, highlighting His majesty and authority. The use of cherubim also connects to the vision of God's throne in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where cherubim are described as living creatures supporting the divine chariot.<p><b>He soared on the wings of the wind.</b><br>The phrase "wings of the wind" conveys the idea of speed and the omnipresence of God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, wind was often seen as a powerful force, and here it symbolizes God's swift action and His control over creation. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, where God is described as making the clouds His chariot and walking on the wings of the wind. The metaphor of soaring suggests not only speed but also the transcendence and freedom of God, who is not bound by earthly limitations. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is depicted as having authority over nature, as in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, where Jesus calms the storm, demonstrating His divine power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies, including King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherub.htm">Cherub</a></b><br>In biblical terms, cherubim are angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God.

Here it pictures God arriving faster than any earthly help could.<p>&#8226; For David, that meant rescue from Saul (<a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a> title). For us, it means the Lord remains instantly present, &#8220;an ever-present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a> couples wind imagery with covenant care: &#8220;I carried you on eagles&#8217; wings.&#8221; Likewise, God&#8217;s flight in <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a> assures believers that He still bears His people out of danger and into safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> uses two vivid images&#8212;God riding a cherub and soaring on the wind&#8212;to declare that the Almighty leaves His throne without delay to defend His own. The cherub shows His perfect authority over heaven&#8217;s hosts; the wind shows His unstoppable, immediate power over earth&#8217;s elements. Together they assure every believer that the Lord who once rescued David still moves swiftly and sovereignly to protect, deliver, and uphold all who call on His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Cherub.</span>--See <a href="/exodus/25-19.htm" title="And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.">Exodus 25:19</a>. This passage alone would show how naturally the idea of winged attendants on the Divine Being grew out of the phenomena of cloud and storm. No doubt many features of the developed conception were derived from contact with Assyrian art, but for the poetry of this passage we have only to think of those giant pinions into which cloud so often shapes itself, this clause being in close parallelism with "wings of the wind." The variation in Samuel, "appeared" for "did fly," is, no doubt, a transcriber's error. For the picture we may compare Oceanus' approach in <span class= "ital">Prometheus Vinctus:--</span><p>"On the back of the quick-winged bird I glode,<p>And I bridled him in<p>With the will of a God."<p>MRS.

The imagery here transcends all experience, and scarcely admits of comment or explanation. God is represented as borne through the heavens, as he proceeds to execute his purposes, by the highest of his creatures, the cherubim.
