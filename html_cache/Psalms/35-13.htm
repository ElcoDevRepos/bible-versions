In ancient Israel, illness was often seen as a time of vulnerability and need, and the psalmist's response indicates a commitment to intercessory prayer and support. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and echoes the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, where He emphasizes love for enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>I put on sackcloth;</b><br>Wearing sackcloth was a traditional expression of mourning, repentance, or humility in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel. It was typically made from coarse goat's hair and was uncomfortable to wear, symbolizing the wearer's distress or penitence. This act signifies the psalmist's deep sorrow and earnestness in prayer, a practice seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Jonah and the repentance of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>I humbled myself with fasting,</b><br>Fasting is a spiritual discipline that involves abstaining from food to focus on prayer and seeking God's will. In the context of the psalm, fasting represents the psalmist's sincere dedication to interceding for those who were ill. This practice is seen throughout Scripture as a means of humbling oneself before God, seeking His intervention, and demonstrating earnestness in prayer (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>).<p><b>but my prayers returned unanswered.</b><br>The psalmist's experience of unanswered prayer highlights a common biblical theme of waiting on God's timing and sovereignty. This phrase reflects the tension between human expectation and divine will, a theme explored in other parts of Scripture, such as in the lamentations of Jeremiah (<a href="/lamentations/3-8.htm">Lamentations 3:8</a>) and the cries of Job (<a href="/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20</a>).

The context evidently implies something done for the benefit of the whilome friends for whom, in their sickness, the poet had worn sackcloth, and had fasted and adopted all the other signs of mourning. We must therefore set aside (1) the idea of <span class= "ital">fruitless </span>prayer, in spite of the analogy of <a href="/matthew/10-13.htm" title="And if the house be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.">Matthew 10:13</a>, <a href="/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>. (2) The notion that the answer to the prayer came back to the psalmist himself, instead of to those for whom it was offered, must also be set aside. And (3) we must reject the notion of secret, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>silent prayer, in spite of <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm" title="A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-14.htm" title="A gift in secret pacifies anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.">Proverbs 21:14</a>, since all the "outward and visible" signs of mourning are indicated, and the very object was to show sympathy and interest.<p>There remains (1) the literal, <span class= "ital">and my prayer turned upon my bosom, </span>referring to the posture described in <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm" title="I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns for his mother.">Psalm 35:14</a>. (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm" title="So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>, where, however, there is no express mention of prayer.) The words were, as it were, muttered into his bosom. This is the view of Ewald and Delitzsch, but seems prosaic. (2)The far more probable meaning, <span class= "ital">my prayer came back again and again to my bosom, i.e., </span>was repeated over and over again; just as we say, "the thought recurred to my mind." (Comp. the common phrase for thoughts coming upon the heart, <a href="/jeremiah/3-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.">Jeremiah 3:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, etc.) The Hebrew verb has this frequentative sense in one of its conjugations. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as</span> <span class="cmt_word">for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth</span>.
