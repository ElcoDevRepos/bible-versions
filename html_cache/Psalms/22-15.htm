In ancient times, potsherds were common in everyday life, used for various purposes but ultimately discarded when broken. The psalmist's comparison of his strength to a potsherd suggests a state of utter weakness and vulnerability. This imagery reflects the physical and emotional exhaustion experienced by the speaker, often interpreted as David during a time of distress. It also prophetically points to the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross, where His strength was depleted. The reference to a potsherd can also symbolize the fragility of human life and the inevitability of suffering in a fallen world.<p><b>and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth</b><br>This phrase describes extreme thirst, a condition that can occur during intense physical suffering or dehydration. In the context of the crucifixion, this detail aligns with the accounts of Jesus expressing thirst on the cross (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>). The imagery of a parched mouth emphasizes the depth of the psalmist's anguish and desperation. In a broader biblical context, thirst is often used metaphorically to describe a deep spiritual longing for God (<a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>). The physical thirst experienced by the psalmist and by Jesus serves as a poignant reminder of the spiritual thirst that can only be quenched by a relationship with God.<p><b>You lay me in the dust of death</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of being brought to the brink of death, lying in the dust, which is a common biblical metaphor for mortality and the grave (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). The psalmist attributes this condition to God's sovereign will, acknowledging that even in suffering, God is in control. This reflects a deep trust in God's plan, even when facing death. The phrase also foreshadows the death of Jesus, who was laid in the tomb, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). The "dust of death" underscores the reality of human mortality and the hope of resurrection, as Jesus' death and resurrection provide the ultimate victory over death for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing deep anguish and distress, often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of Christ's suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>This psalm is frequently connected to the crucifixion of Jesus, as it vividly describes suffering that parallels the events of the Passion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The imagery in this verse is often associated with the crucifixion, where Jesus experienced extreme physical thirst and weakness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dust_of_death.htm">The Dust of Death</a></b><br>This phrase symbolizes the grave or the brink of death, emphasizing the depth of despair and mortality.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hebrew_people.htm">The Hebrew People</a></b><br>As the original audience, they would have understood the cultural and physical implications of the imagery used in this psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that suffering is a part of the human experience, and even the most faithful, like David and Jesus, endured it.

The image mirrors <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>, &#8220;I am poured out like water,&#8221; emphasizing total depletion.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links withering strength to deep distress (<a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>). The verse is literally true of David&#8217;s crisis, yet it prophetically foreshadows Christ&#8217;s physical drain on the cross, where &#8220;He gives power to the faint&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>) by surrendering His own.<p>&#8226; The dryness highlights helplessness: pottery cannot rehydrate itself; only the potter can restore it. That dependence on God threads through <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and prepares our hearts to see the greater Deliverer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth</b><p>&#8226; Extreme thirst follows extreme weakness. Dehydration in the Near-Eastern sun would glue the tongue to the palate&#8212;an agony captured again in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3, 21</a>.<p>&#8226; At Calvary this line receives its fullest fulfillment when Jesus, &#8220;knowing that everything had now been accomplished&#8230; said, &#8216;I am thirsty&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual application flows from the literal scene: without the Living Water (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>) the soul dries out just as certainly as flesh. The verse invites us to rely on God for both physical and spiritual refreshment, echoing David&#8217;s later confession, &#8220;Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You lay me in the dust of death</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Dust&#8221; recalls <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>: humanity returns to the ground because of sin. David senses God&#8217;s sovereign hand allowing him to lie on death&#8217;s doorstep&#8212;&#8220;our soul is bowed in the dust&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Job used similar words: &#8220;He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a>). The language is not mere metaphor; it foretells the Messiah actually entering death for us (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5, 10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the psalm will soon pivot to victory (<a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22-31</a>). Being &#8220;laid&#8221; in dust does not end the story; God&#8217;s purpose is resurrection. Christ went into the grave, then rose, assuring believers that dust will not have the final word (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a> stacks images of brittle weakness, raging thirst, and nearness to the grave. David&#8217;s honest lament becomes an exact preview of Jesus&#8217; physical sufferings and atoning death. The verse reminds us that God allowed His righteous One to be drained, parched, and buried so that, by faith, we might be strengthened, satisfied, and raised to new life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">My strength.</span>--The conjecture, "my palate," instead of "my strength," improves the parallelism.
