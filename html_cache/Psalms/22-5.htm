This is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Book of Judges, where the cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is repeated. The act of crying out signifies a deep dependence on God, acknowledging Him as the ultimate source of salvation. The phrase "set free" can be connected to the Exodus narrative, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, symbolizing spiritual liberation. This deliverance is a type of the ultimate freedom found in Jesus Christ, who sets believers free from the bondage of sin.<p><b>they trusted in You and were not disappointed.</b><br>Trust in God is a central theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing faith and reliance on His promises. This phrase highlights the reliability and faithfulness of God, as those who place their trust in Him are never let down. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>, which assures that those who hope in God will not be put to shame. The historical context includes numerous instances where God proved faithful to His people, such as the provision of manna in the wilderness and the conquest of Canaan. This trust is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's faithfulness and assures believers that their hope in Him will not lead to disappointment, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of trust in God despite his circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of God who have historically cried out to Him in times of distress and have been delivered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom the cries are directed, representing divine faithfulness and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/historical_deliverances.htm">Historical Deliverances</a></b><br>Events such as the Exodus, where the Israelites cried out to God and were delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_foreshadowing.htm">Messianic Foreshadowing</a></b><br>Psalm 22 is often seen as a prophetic psalm pointing to the sufferings and ultimate trust of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_faithfulness.htm">Trust in God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The historical deliverances of Israel serve as a testament to God's unchanging faithfulness.
