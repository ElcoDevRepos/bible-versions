In the biblical context, it refers to the anointing of a king, which was a common practice in ancient Israel, symbolizing divine approval and empowerment. Theologically, this is seen as a messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the ultimate King in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). The concept of God installing a king also reflects the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>on Zion</b><br>Zion is a term that originally referred to the ancient Jebusite fortress that David captured and made the City of David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>). Over time, it came to represent the entire city of Jerusalem and, symbolically, the spiritual center of God's kingdom. Zion holds significant theological importance as the place where God dwells among His people (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>) and is often used in prophetic literature to describe the future reign of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>). In the New Testament, Zion is associated with the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).<p><b>upon My holy mountain</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize places of divine revelation and encounter. Mount Zion, in particular, is considered holy because it is the site of the Temple, where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The holiness of the mountain underscores the sacredness of God's choice and the divine nature of the king's authority. This phrase also connects to eschatological themes, where Zion is depicted as the center of God's eternal kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>). The holiness of the mountain emphasizes the purity and righteousness required of the king and his reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, declaring His sovereign action of installing His King.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Messiah)</a></b><br>The anointed one, traditionally understood as a reference to the Davidic king, and prophetically to Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A hill in Jerusalem, symbolically representing God's chosen place for His presence and rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_mountain.htm">Holy Mountain</a></b><br>Refers to Zion, emphasizing its sacredness as the dwelling place of God and His anointed King.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control and has established His King, Jesus, to reign over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_fulfillment.htm">Messianic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understand that <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a> points to Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promise to David, affirming His role as the eternal King.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/z/zion_as_a_symbol.htm">Zion as a Symbol</a></b><br>Reflect on Zion as a symbol of God's presence and His plan for redemption through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_god's_plan.htm">Holiness of God's Plan</a></b><br>Appreciate the sacredness of God's plan, as represented by the "holy mountain," and strive to align our lives with His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_under_christ's_reign.htm">Living Under Christ's Reign</a></b><br>Consider how acknowledging Jesus as King impacts our daily lives, calling us to live in obedience and submission to His authority.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_2_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_6_God_s_sovereignty_in_kingship.htm">How does Psalm 2:6 affirm God's sovereignty in establishing His King?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_I_have_installed_My_King_mean.htm">What does "I have installed My King" reveal about God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_6_and_Jesus_kingship_link.htm">How does Psalm 2:6 connect to Jesus' kingship in the New Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_submit_to_God_s_King.htm">In what ways can we submit to God's appointed King in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_King_on_daily_choices.htm">How does recognizing God's chosen King influence our daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Psalm_2_6_s_My_King_on_Zion.htm">What does "I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy mountain" signify in Psalm 2:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_6_and_divine_kingship_link.htm">How does Psalm 2:6 relate to the concept of divine kingship in Christianity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Zion_important_in_Psalm_2_6.htm">Why is Zion significant in the context of Psalm 2:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_you_believe_in_what_you_cannot_see.htm">What is Zion's significance in biblical prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jesus_unify_the_bible.htm">How does Jesus connect all biblical narratives together?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_god's_holy_mountain.htm">What is God's Holy Mountain?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalms_foreshadow_jesus.htm">How do Psalms foreshadow Jesus Christ's life and mission?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 2:6 Mean</div><b>I have installed</b><p>God is speaking, taking personal credit for setting a ruler in place.

The words are uttered by Jehovah, and must refer to the Anointed One of ver. 2. This Anointed One God has set up as King upon Zion, his holy mountain. Without denying some reference to David, the type, we must regard the Anti-type, Christ, as mainly pointed at.
