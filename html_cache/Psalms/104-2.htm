Light in the Bible often symbolizes holiness, truth, and the divine presence (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). The imagery of God clothing Himself in light suggests His unapproachable holiness and glory, reminiscent of the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>) where His face shone like the sun. The idea of God being wrapped in light also connects to the creation narrative, where God said, "Let there be light" (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>), indicating His sovereign power over creation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, light was often associated with divine beings, setting God apart as the ultimate source of light and life. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), bringing spiritual illumination and salvation.<p><b>He stretches out the heavens like a tent,</b><br>This phrase reflects God's creative power and sovereignty over the universe. The imagery of stretching out the heavens like a tent suggests the vastness and order of creation, akin to the ancient practice of setting up a tent, which was a common activity in nomadic cultures. This metaphor is also found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, emphasizing God's authority and the ease with which He governs the cosmos. The heavens, in biblical terms, often refer to the sky and the celestial realm, highlighting God's transcendence and immanence. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the new creation, where God will establish a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), demonstrating His ongoing creative work and ultimate plan for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as majestic and sovereign, clothing Himself in light and stretching out the heavens.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>The expanse of the sky and universe, symbolizing God's creative power and authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_majesty_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Majesty and Sovereignty</a></b><br>The imagery of God wrapping Himself in light and stretching out the heavens highlights His majesty and sovereign power over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbolism_of_light.htm">The Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>Light symbolizes purity, holiness, and revelation.

Different explanations have been given of the figure. Some see an allusion to the curtains of the Tabernacle (Exodus 26, 27).
