It was established as the political and spiritual capital of Israel by King David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>). The phrase "built up" suggests not only physical construction but also spiritual and communal strengthening. Jerusalem's significance is highlighted in its role as the location of the Temple, where God's presence dwelt among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The city's rebuilding after the Babylonian exile (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>) symbolizes restoration and hope, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>.<p><b>as a city</b><br>Jerusalem's designation as a "city" emphasizes its role as a center of governance, worship, and community. In ancient times, cities were fortified places of refuge and centers of culture and commerce. Jerusalem's status as a city underscores its importance as a hub for the Israelites and a focal point for God's covenant with His people. The city's strategic location made it a vital link between various regions, enhancing its significance in biblical narratives.<p><b>united together</b><br>The unity of Jerusalem is both a physical and spiritual concept. Physically, the city's architecture and fortifications were designed to create a cohesive and defensible urban area. Spiritually, Jerusalem represents the unity of God's people, gathered for worship and communal life. This unity is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's desire for His people to live in harmony (<a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). The unity of Jerusalem also foreshadows the unity of believers in Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>, where the church is called to maintain the unity of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship for the Israelites, representing the spiritual and political heart of the nation.

It is explained to refer either <span class= "ital">to </span>the rebuilding of the city and reuniting of the parts which had been disconnected in the destruction, or, which is far better (see Introduction), is taken as a rustic's impression on first seeing a compact city after being accustomed to straggling villages. The astonishment of Virgil's shepherd is aptly compared: "Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Melibaee putavi, Stultus ego, huic nostrae similem." But a far more satisfactory meaning is suggested by the LXX. They (comp. Symmachus) take the word rendered <span class= "ital">compact </span>as a noun, meaning <span class= "ital">union. </span>The verse then may run: <span class= "ital">Jerusalem, the </span>(<span class= "ital">one</span>)<span class= "ital"> built like a city, union is in it together, i.e.</span>, it is the rallying point of all the tribes.

The primary reference is probably to the compact shape and look of the ancient city, which, as Josephus says, was "one and entire," with no straggling suburbs, shut in on the north by a wall, and on the three other sides both by walls and by deep, rocky valleys. But the material "compactness" was perhaps taken to symbolize the close internal union of the inhabitants one with another, whereby they were all knit together into one Church and people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/122-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is built up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1506;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">united</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1495;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;&#7717;ub&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative &#124; Verb - Pual - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2266.htm">Strong's 2266: </a> </span><span class="str2">To unite, be joined, to tie a magic knot or spell, to charm</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7717;&#183;d&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3162.htm">Strong's 3162: </a> </span><span class="str2">A unit, unitedly</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/122-3.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 122:3 Jerusalem that is built as a city (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/122-2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 122:2"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 122:2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/122-4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 122:4"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 122:4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
