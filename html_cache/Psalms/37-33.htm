In biblical context, the "power" refers to the influence or control of the wicked over the righteous. Throughout Scripture, God is depicted as a protector and deliverer of His people, as seen in the stories of Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) and Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6). The assurance that God will not abandon His faithful ones is a recurring theme, reflecting His covenant faithfulness. This promise is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus assures His followers of His constant presence (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>or let them be condemned under judgment</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's role as the ultimate judge who ensures justice for the righteous. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, legal systems were often biased against the poor and the righteous, who could be unjustly accused or condemned. The psalmist reassures believers that God will not allow unjust condemnation to prevail. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God vindicates His people, as seen in the story of Esther, where the Jews are delivered from Haman's plot (Esther 9). Theologically, this points to the ultimate judgment where believers are justified through faith in Christ, who bore the condemnation on their behalf (<a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful and just, protecting His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous (Him)</a></b><br>The individual who trusts in the LORD and follows His ways, often facing opposition from the wicked.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked (Their)</a></b><br>Those who oppose the righteous and seek to bring them harm or judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The process or act of making a decision or forming an opinion, often in a legal or moral context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (Author)</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, providing wisdom and encouragement to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>Trust in God's promise that He will not abandon the righteous to the power of the wicked.
