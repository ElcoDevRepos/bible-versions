This phrase reflects the psalmist's feeling of being surrounded by those who are considered impure or adversarial. In a broader biblical context, "dogs" can represent Gentiles or those outside the covenant community, as seen in <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26-27</a>. The imagery here suggests a sense of being besieged by relentless and aggressive enemies.<p><b>a band of evil men encircles me;</b><br>The "band of evil men" indicates a group of malicious individuals who are united in their intent to harm the psalmist. This phrase highlights the collective nature of the threat, emphasizing the overwhelming odds faced by the individual. Historically, this could reflect the experiences of King David, who often faced opposition from various groups. Theologically, it foreshadows the gathering of those who would conspire against Jesus, as seen in the Gospels, particularly during His arrest and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47</a>).<p><b>they have pierced my hands and feet.</b><br>This phrase is often seen as a prophetic reference to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, where His hands and feet were literally pierced by nails. While the original Hebrew text is debated, the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses language that aligns with the idea of piercing. This connection is reinforced by New Testament passages such as <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25-27</a>, where Thomas refers to the marks of the nails in Jesus' hands. The piercing serves as a vivid type of Christ's suffering and sacrifice, fulfilling the messianic prophecy and underscoring the psalm's role as a foreshadowing of the Passion narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of anguish and persecution, which is both personal and prophetic.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dogs.htm">Dogs</a></b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, "dogs" were often used metaphorically to describe those who were considered unclean or contemptible.

But no intelligible meaning can be got out of "like a lion my hands and my feet." Nor does the plan commend itself of dividing the verses differently, and reading, "The congregation of wicked men have gathered round me like a lion. On my hands and my feet I can tell all my bones." The punctuation of the text must therefore be given up, and a meaning sought by changing the reading. The necessity of a change is supported both by the ancient versions and by some MSS., and also by the Masora; though considerable difference exists as to what the word should be read. If the authority of the ancient versions alone were to decide, some verb in the past tense must be read, but the most reasonable course is to accept the present text, but with a different vowel, treating it as a participle, with suffix, of <span class= "ital">k-r, </span>whose root-idea, according to Ewald, is "to bind;" but according to most other scholars is "to dig." It is, however, so doubtful whether it can mean <span class= "ital">to dig through</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to pierce--that it is better to understand here a binding of the limbs so tightly as to <span class= "ital">dig into </span>them, and wound them.
