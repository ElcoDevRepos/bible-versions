In biblical context, "fear" often denotes respect and submission to authority. The king's role as a just and righteous ruler reflects God's own governance, and this reverence is due to his embodiment of divine justice. The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where it is the beginning of knowledge. This reverence is not just for the king's power but for his embodiment of God's will on earth.<p><b>as long as the sun shines</b><br>The sun is a symbol of constancy and endurance. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the sun was often associated with divine presence and blessing. This phrase suggests the enduring nature of the king's reign, which is a foreshadowing of the eternal reign of Christ. The sun's daily rising and setting is a reminder of God's faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are new every morning. The imagery here points to the everlasting nature of God's covenant with David, fulfilled in Jesus.<p><b>as long as the moon remains</b><br>The moon, like the sun, is a symbol of time and continuity. Its phases and cycles were used to mark time in ancient Israel. This phrase underscores the perpetual nature of the king's influence and the enduring legacy of his righteous rule. The moon's presence in the night sky serves as a reminder of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>, where the moon is described as a faithful witness in the sky. This reflects the eternal nature of Christ's kingdom, which will not wane or diminish.<p><b>through all generations</b><br>This phrase highlights the lasting impact of the king's reign across time. It suggests a legacy that transcends individual lifetimes, pointing to the eternal kingdom of Christ. The promise of a kingdom that endures through all generations is rooted in the Davidic Covenant, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever. This is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, whose kingdom is not limited by time or human succession. The continuity of God's promises through generations is a testament to His faithfulness and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom and wealth. This psalm is often seen as a prayer for his reign and a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>King David, Solomon's father, is often associated with the Psalms.
