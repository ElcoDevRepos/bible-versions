A "handbreadth" is an ancient unit of measurement, roughly the width of four fingers, symbolizing something very short and limited. In biblical times, this measurement was used to convey the idea of transience and the fleeting nature of life. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, which speaks of the shortness of life, and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The acknowledgment of God as the one who determines the length of our days underscores His sovereignty and the human need for humility.<p><b>and my lifetime as nothing before You</b><br>This phrase highlights the insignificance of human life in comparison to the eternal nature of God. In the grand scheme of God's eternal existence, human life is but a moment. This perspective is consistent with the biblical theme of human humility before God, as seen in <a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>, where life is described as a breath. The phrase also reflects the biblical understanding of God's omnipotence and the temporal nature of earthly existence, encouraging believers to focus on eternal values rather than temporal achievements.<p><b>Truly each man at his best exists as but a breath</b><br>Here, the psalmist acknowledges that even at the peak of human strength and achievement, life is still ephemeral. The word "breath" is often used in scripture to denote something fleeting and insubstantial, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>, where life is described as "vanity" or "meaningless." This serves as a reminder of the limitations of human power and the futility of relying on worldly accomplishments. It calls believers to place their trust in God, who is eternal and unchanging, rather than in their own abilities or the temporary things of this world.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. It serves as a moment to meditate on the profound truths just expressed, encouraging deeper contemplation of the brevity of life and the eternal nature of God. This pause allows for introspection and a reassessment of one's priorities in light of the eternal perspective provided by the psalm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>, David is expressing his reflections on the brevity and frailty of human life in this psalm.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The psalm is directed towards God, acknowledging His sovereignty over human life and time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude, emphasizing the importance of the preceding statement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_brevity_of_life.htm">The Brevity of Life</a></b><br>Recognize that our time on earth is limited and should be used wisely.<br><br>Reflect on how the shortness of life should influence our priorities and decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_time.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Time</a></b><br>Acknowledge that God is in control of our lifespan and trust in His timing.<br><br>Understand that our lives are part of a larger divine plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_frailty_and_dependence_on_god.htm">Human Frailty and Dependence on God</a></b><br>Accept that human strength and achievements are temporary and rely on God for true significance.<br><br>Cultivate humility by recognizing our limitations and God's greatness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focus on what has eternal value, such as faith, love, and service to God and others.<br><br>Encourage a lifestyle that reflects eternal priorities rather than temporary gains.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_39_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 39:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_39_5_Life_s_brevity_God_s_eternity.htm">How does Psalm 39:5 remind us of life's brevity and God's eternal nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_life_s_brevity_affect_choices.htm">In what ways can acknowledging life's "fleeting" nature impact daily decisions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_39_5_James_4_14_Life_s_Uncertainty.htm">How does Psalm 39:5 connect with James 4:14 on life's uncertainty?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_eternal_over_temporal.htm">What practical steps can you take to prioritize eternal values over temporal ones?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_do_life_s_limits_deepen_faith.htm">How can recognizing life's "handbreadths" lead to a deeper reliance on God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_39_5_on_life_s_brevity.htm">What does Psalm 39:5 reveal about the brevity of human life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_39_5_Time_vs_Eternity_Challenge.htm">How does Psalm 39:5 challenge our perception of time and eternity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Psalm_39_5_stress_human_frailty.htm">Why does Psalm 39:5 emphasize the insignificance of human existence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'root_of_jesse'_mean.htm">What does 'life is a vapor' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'life_is_a_vapor'_mean.htm">What does "life is a vapor" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bible's_view_on_lifespan.htm">What does the Bible say about our lifespan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_faith_of_the_gospel.htm">What does the Bible say about our lifespan?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 39:5 Mean</div><b>You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths</b><p>David looks at his calendar and realizes God is the One who set it.
