In biblical times, jewelry was often a symbol of status and wealth, indicating that the individuals described here are flaunting their arrogance. Pride is frequently condemned in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The imagery of a necklace suggests that pride is a central part of their identity, much like a necklace is a prominent accessory. This can be contrasted with the humility that is a hallmark of a righteous life, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who, despite His divine nature, took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p><b>a garment of violence covers them.</b><br>The metaphor of a garment indicates that violence is as much a part of these individuals as the clothes they wear. In ancient cultures, clothing was not only functional but also a reflection of one's character and social standing. The use of "violence" here suggests actions that are aggressive and oppressive, aligning with the biblical theme that those who live by violence will ultimately face judgment (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>). This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of the wicked prospering temporarily, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>, but ultimately facing divine justice. The imagery of being "covered" by violence implies that it is pervasive and all-encompassing, leaving no part of their lives untouched by their aggressive actions. This stands in stark contrast to the righteousness and peace that are the garments of those who follow God (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
