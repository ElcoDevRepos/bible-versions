The act of dancing in worship is seen in various parts of Scripture, such as when Miriam led the women in dance after the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) and when David danced before the Lord as the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>). This phrase emphasizes the physical expression of worship, indicating that praising God involves the whole being, not just verbal or mental acknowledgment. The use of dance in worship highlights the joy and freedom found in God's presence.<p><b>and make music to Him with tambourine and harp</b><br>The tambourine and harp were common instruments in ancient Israel, used in both secular and sacred contexts. The tambourine, a percussion instrument, was often associated with celebration and victory, as seen in the story of Jephthah's daughter who greeted her father with tambourines and dancing (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>). The harp, a stringed instrument, was used by David to soothe King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>) and is frequently mentioned in the Psalms as an instrument of worship. This phrase underscores the importance of music in worship, serving as a means to glorify God and express the worshiper's devotion. The combination of instruments suggests a harmonious and joyful offering to God, reflecting the beauty and order of creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/149.htm">Psalm 149</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote about worship and praise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, often the subject of the Psalms, called to worship and praise God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the Temple in Jerusalem was a central place of worship and music for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/musicians_and_dancers.htm">Musicians and Dancers</a></b><br>Individuals who played instruments and danced as part of worship, reflecting the communal and celebratory nature of praising God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/instruments.htm">Instruments (Tambourine and Harp)</a></b><br>These were common instruments used in Hebrew worship, symbolizing joy and celebration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_worship.htm">The Joy of Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be a joyful expression of our love and reverence for God.
