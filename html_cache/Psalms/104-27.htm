It reflects the biblical theme of God's providence and care for His creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29-30</a>, where God provides food for both humans and animals. The idea of creatures looking to God can also be connected to the imagery in <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15-16</a>, where the eyes of all look to God, and He provides for their needs. This dependence underscores the sovereignty of God over creation, a theme prevalent throughout the Psalms.<p><b>to give them their food</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's role as the provider. In the ancient Near Eastern context, where agriculture was central to life, the provision of food was a direct sign of divine blessing and favor. The Israelites understood that their harvests were dependent on God's provision, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-15</a>, where obedience to God results in rain and fruitful crops. This phrase also points to the broader biblical narrative of God as the sustainer, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>in due season</b><br>The concept of "due season" indicates God's perfect timing and order in creation. It reflects the agricultural cycles that were crucial to the survival of ancient societies, as well as the trust in God's timing for provision. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> speaks to the idea that there is a time for everything, reinforcing the belief in God's ordained seasons. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the fullness of time, came to fulfill God's plan of salvation (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).

He cares for the lions that &#8220;seek their food from God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>) and for the ravens that &#8220;cry out to God for help&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the psalm speaks universally, it levels human pride: we are part of a vast family of dependents. <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a> puts it plainly: &#8220;The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in due season&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>look to You</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Look&#8221; pictures an active expectancy&#8212;creatures have no backup plan.

God intends His world to lean on Him so that &#8220;in Him all things hold together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in a fallen world groaning for renewal (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>), creation&#8217;s instinct is to seek its Maker for provision. Whenever a sparrow finds a crumb, it silently testifies to <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>: &#8220;Not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to give them their food</b><p>&#8226; Food is the most basic need, yet God does not delegate this foundational gift.

Jesus linked daily bread with the &#8220;true bread from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>).
