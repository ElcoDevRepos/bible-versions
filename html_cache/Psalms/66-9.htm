Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as the one who holds the power over life and death (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The preservation of life can be seen in the context of Israel's history, where God repeatedly delivered His people from peril, such as during the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29-31</a>). The idea of God preserving life is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of His role as the Good Shepherd who gives life abundantly (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10-11</a>). This preservation is not just physical but also spiritual, as God offers eternal life through faith in Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>and keeps our feet from slipping.</b><br>This phrase suggests stability and guidance, indicating God's role in providing a firm foundation for believers. In biblical times, the imagery of slipping feet was often associated with danger or falling into sin (<a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>). The terrain of ancient Israel, with its rocky paths and steep hills, made slipping a common physical danger, which serves as a metaphor for spiritual peril. God's guidance is likened to a shepherd leading his flock safely (<a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3-4</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the cornerstone, providing a stable foundation for faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The assurance that God keeps our feet from slipping is a promise of His faithfulness and the security found in His guidance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the preserver and protector of life.
