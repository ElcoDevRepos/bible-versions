Joseph had been unjustly imprisoned after being falsely accused by Potiphar's wife. The king's action signifies a divine intervention in Joseph's life, fulfilling God's plan for him. This release is a pivotal moment in Joseph's story, as it transitions him from a prisoner to a position of power. The king's decision to release Joseph can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Joseph, as revealed in his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). This act of release is also a type of Christ, who was sent by God to release humanity from the bondage of sin.<p><b>the ruler of peoples set him free.</b><br>Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, was one of the most powerful leaders of the ancient world, often referred to as the ruler of peoples due to Egypt's influence and control over various nations. By setting Joseph free, Pharaoh not only acknowledges Joseph's innocence but also recognizes the wisdom and divine insight Joseph possesses, as demonstrated by his ability to interpret dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14-16</a>). This act of setting Joseph free is symbolic of God's sovereignty and His ability to elevate His chosen ones to positions of influence and authority. It also prefigures the ultimate liberation that Christ offers to all believers, freeing them from spiritual captivity and granting them a place in His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Refers to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, who had the authority to release Joseph from prison.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers, falsely accused, and imprisoned in Egypt.
