David, the youngest son of Jesse, was chosen by God to be king over Israel, despite not being the obvious choice by human standards (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). The term "servant" signifies a special relationship with God, marked by obedience and dedication. David's role as a servant foreshadows the ultimate Servant, Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's will (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). The finding of David emphasizes God's initiative in selecting leaders according to His purposes, not human criteria.<p><b>with My sacred oil I have anointed him.</b><br>Anointing with oil was a significant ritual in ancient Israel, symbolizing the setting apart of an individual for a divine purpose. This act was performed by the prophet Samuel, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, marking David as God's chosen king. The oil represents the Holy Spirit's empowerment, which enabled David to fulfill his role. This anointing prefigures the anointing of Jesus, the Messiah (meaning "Anointed One"), who was empowered by the Holy Spirit for His ministry (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The sacred oil signifies God's blessing and authority bestowed upon David, establishing his kingship as divinely ordained.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God for his heart and faithfulness.
