Abraham is often referred to as God's servant, indicating his obedience and faithfulness. The Abrahamic Covenant, found in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:1-21, and 17:1-14, is foundational to understanding Israel's identity and God's plan for redemption. This covenant included promises of land, descendants, and blessing, which are central themes throughout the Bible. The term "offspring" connects to the promise of numerous descendants, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>. Abraham's role as a patriarch is crucial, as he is considered the father of faith (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11-12</a>), and his faith is a model for believers.<p><b>O sons of Jacob</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, is the grandson of Abraham and the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. This phrase underscores the continuity of God's covenant through the generations. Jacob's life, marked by struggles and divine encounters, is pivotal in the narrative of Israel's formation. The transformation of Jacob's name to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>) signifies a new identity and mission for his descendants. The "sons of Jacob" refers to the twelve tribes, each playing a unique role in Israel's history. This lineage is significant in biblical prophecy and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as seen in the blessings Jacob gives to his sons in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.<p><b>His chosen ones</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the concept of election, where God selects individuals or groups for a specific purpose. Israel is often referred to as God's chosen people, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). This choice is not based on merit but on God's sovereign will and love. The idea of being chosen carries responsibilities, including living according to God's laws and being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include all believers in Christ, who are described as a chosen people (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The chosen status of Israel foreshadows the spiritual election of the Church, highlighting God's plan to bring salvation to all nations through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Known as the father of faith, Abraham is a central figure in the Bible. God made a covenant with him, promising that he would be the father of many nations. His faith and obedience are foundational to understanding God's relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, Jacob was later named Israel. He is the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. His life is marked by struggles and encounters with God, which shaped the destiny of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chosen_ones.htm">The Chosen Ones</a></b><br>This term refers to the descendants of Abraham and Jacob, the Israelites, who were chosen by God to be His people.
