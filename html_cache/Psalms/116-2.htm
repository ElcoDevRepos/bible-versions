In the ancient Near Eastern context, gods were often seen as distant and unapproachable, but the God of Israel is depicted as personal and caring. The imagery of God inclining His ear suggests a deliberate action, indicating His readiness to hear and respond. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises to be attentive to their cries (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). The idea of God listening is also echoed in other Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states that the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their cry.<p><b>I will call on Him</b><br>The psalmist's response to God's attentiveness is a commitment to prayer. Calling on God is a recurring theme in the Psalms and throughout Scripture, signifying reliance on God's power and faithfulness. This act of calling is not just a one-time event but a continual practice, reflecting a life of dependence on God. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where calling on the name of the Lord is associated with worship and seeking divine intervention (<a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>, <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>). It underscores the importance of prayer as a means of maintaining a relationship with God.<p><b>as long as I live</b><br>This phrase indicates a lifelong commitment to seeking God. It suggests that the psalmist's relationship with God is not based on temporary circumstances but is a permanent aspect of his life. This lifelong dedication is a common theme in the wisdom literature, where the fear of the Lord and obedience to His commandments are seen as the path to a blessed life (<a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>). The phrase also implies perseverance in faith, regardless of life's challenges, and reflects the biblical call to remain steadfast in one's devotion to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/116.htm">Psalm 116</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, though the specific identity is not definitively known.
