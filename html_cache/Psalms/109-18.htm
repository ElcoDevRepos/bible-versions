In biblical times, clothing was a significant part of one's identity and social status. The imagery of wearing cursing like a coat implies that the person is not only surrounded by curses but also identified by them. This can be seen as a reflection of the consequences of living a life contrary to God's will, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's commandments. The coat imagery also connects to the idea of being clothed in righteousness or unrighteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where righteousness is described as a garment.<p><b>may it soak into his body like water</b><br>Water is a vital element in the Bible, often symbolizing life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit. However, in this context, water represents the pervasive and penetrating nature of the curse. Just as water can seep into every part of the body, the curse is intended to infiltrate every aspect of the person's life. This imagery highlights the inescapable and consuming nature of divine judgment when one is separated from God's protection. The idea of water soaking into the body can also be contrasted with the living water that Jesus offers in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, which brings eternal life rather than destruction.<p><b>and into his bones like oil</b><br>Oil in the Bible is frequently associated with anointing, healing, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. It was used in ancient Israel for anointing kings and priests, symbolizing God's blessing and empowerment. However, in this verse, oil represents the deep penetration of the curse into the very structure of the person's being, much like oil that seeps into bones. This suggests a profound and lasting impact, affecting the individual's strength and vitality. The contrast here is with the anointing of the Holy Spirit, which brings life and empowerment, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> when David is anointed by Samuel. The imagery of oil in the bones can also be seen as a perversion of the intended purpose of oil, turning what is meant for blessing into a vehicle for judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and plea for justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm speaks against those who have wronged David, using deceit and curses against him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and deliverer whom David calls upon for justice and vindication.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which the psalm was written, where curses and blessings held significant spiritual and social weight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist's_adversaries.htm">The Psalmist's Adversaries</a></b><br>Those who are characterized by their malicious intent and actions against the psalmist.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words can deeply affect both the speaker and the recipient.
