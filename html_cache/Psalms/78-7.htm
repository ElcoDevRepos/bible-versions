Throughout the Old Testament, Israel is repeatedly called to place their trust in God rather than in idols or human strength (e.g., <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). The historical context of Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land is a backdrop for this call to confidence, as God demonstrated His power and faithfulness through miracles and guidance. This trust is foundational to the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, where God is described as faithful, keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations.<p><b>not forgetting His works</b><br>The call to remember God's works is a recurring theme in Scripture, serving as a reminder of His past faithfulness and power. The Israelites were instructed to remember the mighty acts of God, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). This remembrance was intended to strengthen their faith and obedience. The cultural practice of oral tradition and the establishment of festivals like Passover were means to ensure that God's works were not forgotten. In the New Testament, Jesus' miracles and resurrection are central works that believers are called to remember and proclaim (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24-26</a>).<p><b>but keeping His commandments</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. The commandments given at Sinai (Exodus 20) were not just rules but a way of life that set Israel apart as God's chosen people. Keeping these commandments was a demonstration of love and loyalty to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-6</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus summarizes the law with the commandments to love God and love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>), showing that true obedience flows from a heart transformed by God's love. The call to keep God's commandments is also a prophetic foreshadowing of the new covenant, where the law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, a prominent Levite musician and seer in the time of King David, who composed this psalm as a historical reflection and a teaching tool for Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the psalm is addressed, serving as a reminder of their history and God's faithfulness, urging them to remain obedient and faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_works.htm">God's Works</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous deeds and acts of deliverance performed by God throughout Israel's history, such as the Exodus and provision in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments.htm">Commandments</a></b><br>The laws and decrees given by God to Israel, which they are urged to remember and obey as a sign of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/generations.htm">Generations</a></b><br>The psalm emphasizes the importance of passing down the knowledge of God&#8217;s works and commandments to future generations to ensure continued faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_god.htm">Confidence in God</a></b><br>Believers are called to place their trust and hope in God, recognizing His sovereignty and faithfulness throughout history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_works.htm">Remembering God's Works</a></b><br>It is crucial to actively remember and recount God's past deeds, both in Scripture and in personal life, to strengthen faith and encourage obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_commandments.htm">Obedience to Commandments</a></b><br>Keeping God's commandments is a vital expression of faith and trust in Him, reflecting a commitment to live according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_faithfulness.htm">Generational Faithfulness</a></b><br>Passing down the knowledge of God&#8217;s works and commandments to future generations is essential for maintaining a legacy of faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_forgetfulness.htm">Avoiding Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Spiritual forgetfulness can lead to disobedience and a lack of faith;
