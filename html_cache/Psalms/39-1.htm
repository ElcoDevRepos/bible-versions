The role of the choirmaster was significant in ancient Israelite worship, as music was a central part of their religious expression. The choirmaster would ensure that the psalm was performed correctly, maintaining the spiritual and liturgical integrity of the service.<p><b>For Jeduthun.</b><br>Jeduthun was one of the chief musicians appointed by King David, as mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-41.htm">1 Chronicles 16:41-42</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>. He was a Levite and played a significant role in the musical worship of Israel. This reference suggests that the psalm was either composed for or by Jeduthun, or that it was to be performed in a style associated with him.<p><b>A Psalm of David.</b><br>David, the second king of Israel, is traditionally credited with writing many of the psalms. His life experiences, including his time as a shepherd, warrior, and king, deeply influenced his writings. This psalm reflects David's personal struggles and his desire for righteousness, offering insight into his relationship with God.<p><b>I said, &#8220;I will watch my ways so that I will not sin with my tongue;</b><br>David's commitment to watching his ways highlights the importance of self-discipline and vigilance in the life of a believer. The tongue is often seen as a source of sin, as echoed in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-10</a>, where the tongue is described as a small part of the body that can cause great harm. This phrase underscores the need for careful speech and the avoidance of sin through words.<p><b>I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are present.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of a muzzle suggests a strong restraint, indicating the seriousness with which David approaches the control of his speech. The presence of the wicked implies a context of temptation or provocation, where careless words could lead to sin or give the wicked an opportunity to blaspheme God. This reflects the biblical principle of being wise and cautious in the presence of those who do not share the same values, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a> and <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, King David, is expressing a personal commitment to self-control, particularly in speech.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>This refers to those who are unrighteous or morally wrong, whose presence prompts David to be cautious with his words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tongue.htm">The Tongue</a></b><br>Symbolic of speech and communication, the tongue is a focal point for self-discipline in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/muzzle.htm">Muzzle</a></b><br>A metaphor for restraint, indicating the need for control over one's speech.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/ways.htm">Ways</a></b><br>This term refers to one's conduct or behavior, emphasizing the importance of living righteously.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Our words have the power to build up or tear down.

That reminder lifts the words from private reflection to congregational instruction, much like <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, where singing Scripture teaches and admonishes the gathered saints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For Jeduthun</b><p>Jeduthun, one of David&#8217;s chief musicians (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1, 3</a>), is entrusted with songs that emphasize meditation and solemnity. Linking the psalm to a known worship leader invites the congregation to imitate his reverent posture, echoing the call of <a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1&#8211;2</a> to wait quietly for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Psalm of David</b><p>The superscription roots the message in David&#8217;s life&#8212;a man after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>) who knew both triumph and failure. His authorship reminds believers that godly people still battle their own words (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), and that repentance and worship can flow from the same pen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I said, &#8220;I will watch my ways&#8221;</b><p>David makes a deliberate, verbal commitment to self-discipline (<a href="/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>). The phrase mirrors <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26&#8211;27</a>, which urges careful attention to one&#8217;s path. Intentional living is presented not as legalism but as loving obedience to a holy God (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that I will not sin with my tongue</b><p>The focus narrows to speech, acknowledging the tongue&#8217;s power to bless or destroy (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>; <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5&#8211;6</a>). David knows that careless words can betray faith (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>). By targeting this small yet potent member, he addresses a root issue that often precedes greater transgression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will guard my mouth with a muzzle</b><p>The imagery is vivid: a restraining device that prevents harmful outbursts. <a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a> echoes the same prayer, &#8220;Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly links verbal restraint with wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>; 13:3). The promise is not to speak less truth but to speak it at the Spirit&#8217;s prompting (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As long as the wicked are present</b><p>Awareness of hostile onlookers heightens the need for godly speech (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15-16</a>). David does not retreat from the ungodly but chooses holiness in their sight, so that &#8220;those who accuse you&#8230;may be put to shame&#8221; (same verse). His resolve resembles Christ&#8217;s silent dignity before accusers (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a> captures David&#8217;s conscious pledge to curb sinful speech, motivated by a desire to honor God amid unbelievers. He treats the tongue as a battlefield, applying rigorous self-control while trusting the Lord to enable it. For believers today, the verse calls us to worshipful vigilance&#8212;choosing words that reflect Christ&#8217;s character, guarding our testimony before a watching world, and relying on God&#8217;s grace to keep our mouths in check.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">My tongue.</span>--To enter into the feeling of the poet we must remember the unrestrained way in which Orientals give way to grief.
