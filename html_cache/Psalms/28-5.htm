Biblically, this disregard is often associated with idolatry and rebellion against God, as seen in the Israelites' history (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32:1-6</a>). The works of the LORD refer to His creation, providence, and acts of salvation, which are evident throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>; <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). This disregard is a recurring theme, warning against the hardness of heart that leads to spiritual downfall.<p><b>or what His hands have done</b><br>The "hands" of the LORD symbolize His power and involvement in the world. This phrase underscores God's active role in history and His ongoing work in creation and redemption. The imagery of God's hands is used throughout the Bible to convey His might and craftsmanship (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>). The failure to acknowledge what His hands have done is a rejection of His sovereignty and a denial of His creative and redemptive acts, which are evident in both the natural world and the history of Israel.<p><b>He will tear them down</b><br>This phrase indicates divine judgment. The tearing down is a metaphor for destruction and removal from a place of prominence or security. In the Old Testament, God often used this language to describe the fate of nations and individuals who opposed Him (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-10</a>). It reflects the principle of divine retribution, where God acts against those who persist in rebellion and sin. This judgment is both a warning and a fulfillment of God's justice.<p><b>and never rebuild them</b><br>The finality of this statement emphasizes the completeness of God's judgment. Unlike human destruction, which can be temporary, God's decision to "never rebuild" signifies an irreversible judgment. This echoes the fate of cities like Sodom and Gomorrah, which were destroyed and never restored (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience and the ultimate authority of God over the destiny of nations and individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28</a>, David is expressing a plea for God's intervention against those who disregard God's works.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature, and His role as the Creator and Judge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who ignore or reject the works and deeds of the LORD, leading to their eventual downfall.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works_of_the_lord.htm">The Works of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to God's creation, providence, and acts of salvation and judgment throughout history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event or process by which God enacts justice, particularly against those who fail to acknowledge His works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_works.htm">Recognizing God's Works</a></b><br>Acknowledge the evidence of God's handiwork in creation and history.

Creation itself proclaims God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>), yet these individuals &#8220;ignore the deeds of the LORD and the work of His hands&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a> reminds us that when people know God but refuse to honor Him, their thinking becomes futile. The hard heart starts with a refusal to acknowledge obvious truth.<p>&#8226; By calling this out, David affirms that God&#8217;s self-revelation is plain; failure to recognize it is moral rebellion, not lack of data.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or what His hands have done</b><p>The focus narrows from God&#8217;s &#8220;works&#8221; in general to His &#8220;hands,&#8221; a vivid picture of personal involvement.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;hands&#8221; fashioned the heavens (<a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>), formed Israel (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>), and continually sustain life (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Overlooking these deeds insults the very character of the One who lovingly crafts and upholds His creation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/95-5.htm">Psalm 95:5</a> says, &#8220;The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land&#8221;.

It is the righteous response to persistent, unrepentant contempt.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this principle in <a href="/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>&#8212;whoever falls on the cornerstone and resists Him will be crushed.
