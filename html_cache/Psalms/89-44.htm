Historically, the Davidic dynasty was promised an everlasting throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), yet here, the psalmist laments its apparent downfall. The splendor of a king in ancient Israel was not only in wealth and power but also in divine favor and blessing. The loss of splendor suggests a withdrawal of God's favor, possibly due to the nation's unfaithfulness. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Babylonian exile, where the monarchy was effectively ended, and the people were taken captive (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-21</a>).<p><b>and cast his throne to the ground</b><br>The imagery of a throne being cast to the ground signifies the complete overthrow of royal authority and power. In the ancient Near East, a throne symbolized not just political power but also divine endorsement. The casting down of the throne could be seen as a divine judgment against the king or the nation. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who deposes kings and raises others up. Theologically, this can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though He was the ultimate King, was humbled and rejected (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>), yet His throne is established forever (<a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, traditionally believed to be a wise man during the time of Solomon, who composed this psalm as a reflection on God's covenant with David and the apparent failure of that promise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/davidic_covenant.htm">Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise made by God to King David, ensuring that his descendants would rule Israel forever.

The kingdom of Judah did not merely decline; it was terminated by divine decree when Babylon marched in (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>).<p>- This interruption never nullified God&#8217;s promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>). Rather, it demonstrated that sin brings real consequences while still leaving room for ultimate fulfillment in the Messiah (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his splendor</b><p>- Royal &#8220;splendor&#8221; speaks of visible glory&#8212;crowns, processions, influence and honor (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-5.htm">Psalm 21:5</a>).<p>- When God withdrew His favor, the majesty surrounding the king dissolved. <a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a> captures it: &#8220;The LORD has swallowed up without pity&#8230; He has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its princes.&#8221;<p>- Yet the loss of Davidic splendor foreshadows the Servant&#8208;King whose beauty would be veiled (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>) before being exalted above every name (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cast his throne</b><p>- A throne embodies authority (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>).

Nothing remains elevated; the royal line lies in the dust.<p>- This image invites repentance and hope.
