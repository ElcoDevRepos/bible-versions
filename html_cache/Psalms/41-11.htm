In the context of the psalm, David expresses confidence in God's support despite his adversities. The concept of God delighting in His people is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>, where God rejoices over His people with singing. This delight is not based on human merit but on God's covenant love and grace. The assurance of God's delight can be seen as a type of Christ, who, during His baptism, was declared by God as His beloved Son in whom He is well pleased (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). This delight signifies a relationship marked by divine favor and acceptance.<p><b>for my enemy does not triumph over me</b><br>David's statement here is one of victory and divine protection. Historically, David faced numerous enemies, including King Saul and his own son Absalom. Despite these threats, David often experienced God's deliverance, which he attributes to God's intervention. This triumph over enemies is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is seen as evidence of God's active role in the lives of His people. In a broader biblical context, this victory can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>. The assurance that enemies do not triumph is a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, King David, is expressing his confidence in God's favor and protection against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in whom David places his trust, recognizing His delight and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose David, representing any adversarial forces against the believer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David ruled, often facing external threats and internal challenges.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist's_experience.htm">The Psalmist's Experience</a></b><br>Reflects a personal testimony of God's deliverance and favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_delight_in_us.htm">God's Delight in Us</a></b><br>Recognize that God's delight is not based on our circumstances but on His covenant love and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_over_enemies.htm">Victory Over Enemies</a></b><br>Understand that true victory is not always visible in immediate circumstances but is assured in God's ultimate plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_god's_protection.htm">Confidence in God's Protection</a></b><br>Develop a deep trust in God's protection, knowing that He is sovereign over all adversities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_testimony_of_deliverance.htm">Personal Testimony of Deliverance</a></b><br>Share personal experiences of God's deliverance as a testimony to His faithfulness and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_god's_favor.htm">Living in God's Favor</a></b><br>Live with the assurance of God's favor, which empowers us to face challenges with courage and hope.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_41_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 41:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_41_11_God_s_support_in_adversity.htm">How does Psalm 41:11 affirm God's support in times of adversity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_protection_enemy_can_t_triumph.htm">What does "my enemy does not triumph over me" teach about God's protection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_favor_daily.htm">How can we apply the assurance of God's favor in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_God_s_deliverance_5.htm">Which other scriptures emphasize God's deliverance from enemies?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_41_11_boost_our_faith.htm">How does understanding God's favor in Psalm 41:11 strengthen our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_41_11_show_God_s_support.htm">How does Psalm 41:11 affirm God's support for the righteous?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_41_11_historical_context.htm">What historical context surrounds Psalm 41:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_41_11_and_divine_favor_link.htm">How does Psalm 41:11 relate to the theme of divine favor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_41.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_psalm_41_11_with_defeat.htm">If Psalm 41:11 suggests triumph over enemies is evidence of God&#8217;s favor, how can it be reconciled with godly individuals who appear to be defeated?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_13_4_align_with_god_as_protector.htm">How do we reconcile Psalm 13:4's fear of enemies triumphing with the Bible's portrayal of God as an ultimate protector?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_psalm_43_2_imply_god_forsakes.htm">Why does Psalm 43:2 suggest God has forsaken the writer, when other passages emphasize God's constant presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/leviathan_in_job_vs._other_sea_creatures.htm">How does the portrayal of Leviathan in Job 41 align or conflict with other biblical references to large sea creatures (e.g., Psalm 104:26 or Isaiah 27:1)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 41:11 Mean</div><b>By this I know</b><p>David opens with confident assurance.
