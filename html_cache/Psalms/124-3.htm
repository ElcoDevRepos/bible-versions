In the historical context of ancient Israel, the nation often faced threats from surrounding peoples such as the Philistines, Assyrians, and Babylonians. Anger in the biblical sense often denotes not just emotional rage but a deep-seated opposition that could lead to violence or war. This phrase can be connected to other instances in the Bible where God's people faced the wrath of their enemies, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>, where the Egyptians pursued the Israelites with anger. Theologically, this can also be seen as a representation of spiritual warfare, where the forces of evil rise against God's people.<p><b>then they would have swallowed us alive,</b><br>The imagery of being "swallowed alive" suggests a sudden and complete destruction, akin to being consumed by a great beast. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>, where the earth opened and swallowed Korah and his followers. It conveys a sense of overwhelming danger and helplessness without divine intervention. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such language would resonate with the fear of being utterly defeated by one's enemies. This phrase also typologically points to Jesus Christ, who faced the ultimate wrath and was "swallowed" by death, yet overcame it through His resurrection, offering believers hope and deliverance from spiritual death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of this psalm, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.

Think of Pharaoh&#8217;s fury as he pursued Israel (<a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9&#8211;10</a>) or Saul&#8217;s hot anger toward David (<a href="/1_samuel/20-30.htm">1 Samuel 20:30&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people have repeatedly been the targets of such wrath, yet the Lord stands between them and destruction&#8212;just as He did when Jerusalem was ring-fenced by invading armies yet miraculously preserved (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist is reminding us, in plain terms, that without God&#8217;s intervention, unrestrained human anger poses a literal, life-threatening peril (<a href="/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they would have swallowed us alive</b><p>&#8226; The second clause&#8212;&#8220;then they would have swallowed us alive&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a>b)&#8212;moves from anger to the outcome that anger seeks: total annihilation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Swallow&#8221; evokes the earth opening under Korah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>) and the predatory boast, &#8220;We shall swallow them alive like Sheol&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>).

Left to ourselves, we are defenseless prey; under God&#8217;s shield, the jaws snap shut on empty air (<a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a> declares in vivid terms that if God had not intervened, furious foes would have utterly consumed His people.
