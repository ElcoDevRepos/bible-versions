Zion is not only a physical location but also a symbol of God's presence and His covenant with Israel. The rebuilding of Zion can be seen as a promise of hope and renewal for the people of Israel, especially after periods of destruction or exile, such as the Babylonian captivity. This promise is echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8-9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>, where the restoration of Jerusalem is linked to God's faithfulness and mercy. The rebuilding also foreshadows the ultimate restoration through Christ, who is seen as the cornerstone of a new spiritual Zion, as referenced in <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>.<p><b>He has appeared in His glory.</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine revelation or manifestation of God's presence and power. The appearance of God's glory is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with significant events such as the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>) and the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). In the context of <a href="/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>, it suggests a future time when God's glory will be fully revealed, possibly pointing to the Messianic age when Christ will reign in glory. This is further supported by New Testament references such as <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word made flesh, revealing God's glory. The appearance of God's glory in Zion can also be seen as a type of the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10-11</a>, where God's presence is fully realized among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to His promises and sovereign over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term often used to refer to Jerusalem, the city of God, and by extension, the people of Israel.

The same LORD who first chose Zion will lay every stone, gather every exile, and then manifest His blazing presence there. Past restorations prove He keeps His word; Christ&#8217;s first coming confirms the reality of His appearing; His promised return guarantees the climax of glory. Because the LORD will rebuild Zion and has already appeared in glory, every believer can trust His faithful character, anticipate His transforming presence, and fix hope on the day when His glory fills Zion&#8212;and the whole earth&#8212;forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord shall build up Zion;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because the Lord hath built up Zion.</span> The psalmist, in prophetic ecstasy, sees the future as past.
