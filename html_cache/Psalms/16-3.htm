In the Old Testament context, this would primarily refer to the Israelites who were in covenant with God. The "land" signifies the Promised Land, Canaan, which holds significant theological importance as the inheritance given by God to His people. This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of faith, highlighting the importance of fellowship among believers. The saints are not isolated individuals but a collective community living in the land God has provided.<p><b>they are the excellence</b><br>The word "excellence" suggests moral and spiritual superiority, indicating that the saints embody the highest virtues and qualities esteemed by God. This reflects the biblical theme that God's people are called to be holy and set apart, mirroring His character. The excellence of the saints is not inherent but is derived from their relationship with God and their adherence to His commandments. This phrase underscores the idea that true excellence is found in living according to God's will.<p><b>in whom all my delight resides</b><br>This expression of delight indicates a deep affection and approval from the psalmist, likely David, towards the saints. It reflects the biblical principle that God takes pleasure in His people when they live righteously and in accordance with His statutes. This delight can be seen as a reflection of God's own joy in His faithful followers, as seen in other scriptures where God expresses pleasure in His people (e.g., <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). The phrase also points to the communal joy and encouragement found among believers, as they support and uplift one another in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16</a>, David is expressing his trust and delight in God and His people.
