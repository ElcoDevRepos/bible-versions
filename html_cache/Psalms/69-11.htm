The use of sackcloth is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the stories of Job (<a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>) and the people of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). It symbolizes a deep sense of sorrow or penitence. In the context of <a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David expresses his distress and humility before God, reflecting a heart of repentance and seeking divine intervention. This act of wearing sackcloth can also be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity and was acquainted with grief (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>and I was sport to them</b><br>The phrase "I was sport to them" indicates that the psalmist became an object of ridicule and mockery. This reflects the cultural context where public humiliation was a common form of social ostracism. In biblical times, being mocked or scorned was a severe form of suffering, often reserved for those who were seen as outcasts or enemies. This experience of derision is echoed in the life of Jesus Christ, who was mocked and scorned by the soldiers and the crowd during His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-27.htm">Matthew 27:27-31</a>). The psalmist's experience foreshadows the suffering and rejection that Christ would endure, highlighting the theme of righteous suffering throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and humiliation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>Those who mock and scorn David, taking pleasure in his suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sackcloth.htm">Sackcloth</a></b><br>A coarse material worn as a sign of mourning or repentance, symbolizing humility and distress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often represented by David, experiencing collective suffering and seeking God's deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of comfort and deliverance, whom David seeks in his time of need.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_suffering.htm">Humility in Suffering</a></b><br>David's choice to wear sackcloth signifies humility and recognition of his need for God.

In Scripture, sackcloth is the garment of deep sorrow and repentance.<p>&#8226; We see it when Ahab humbled himself after Elijah&#8217;s rebuke (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The people of Nineveh wore it as they turned from sin (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel sought God &#8220;with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>).<p>By putting on sackcloth, David is not playing the victim; he is taking the posture of genuine mourning&#8212;perhaps over personal sin, definitely over the reproach he bears for God&#8217;s sake (v. 7). His outward clothing matches his inward heart, just as <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a> describes true fasting that reaches the heart. The New Testament ultimately shows this spirit in Christ, who &#8220;emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). Although Jesus did not don literal sackcloth, His life of humility fulfills what David only foreshadowed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I was sport to them</b><p>The second half of the verse reads, &#8220;I became a proverb to them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>), or as older wording puts it, &#8220;I was sport to them.&#8221; David&#8217;s grief becomes everyone else&#8217;s joke.<p>&#8226; Job felt the same sting: &#8220;Now I am their song; I am a byword among them&#8221; (<a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah lamented, &#8220;I have become a laughingstock all day long&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Even drunkards sat at the gate mocking (<a href="/psalms/69-12.htm">Psalm 69:12</a>).<p>This ridicule reaches its climax in Jesus. <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a> is quoted about Christ&#8217;s zeal (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>) and His betrayal (<a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>).
