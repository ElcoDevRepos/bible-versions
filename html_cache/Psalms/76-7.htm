In the context of ancient Israel, the fear of the Lord was a foundational aspect of worship and reverence. The fear mentioned here is not merely terror but a profound respect and awe for God's holiness and authority. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, which states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom." The Israelites were surrounded by nations that worshiped multiple gods, yet they were called to recognize Yahweh as the one true God deserving of reverence. This fear is also a recognition of God's role as the ultimate judge, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>, where God is described as "the great God, mighty and awesome."<p><b>When You are angry,</b><br>The anger of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with His response to sin and disobedience. This phrase reflects the righteous indignation of God against injustice and idolatry. In the historical context, God's anger was often manifested through judgments against Israel and other nations, as seen in the Babylonian exile. The anger of God is not capricious but is a response to the violation of His covenant and moral order. This is evident in the prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, where God's anger leads to cosmic disturbances as a sign of His judgment.<p><b>who can stand before You?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the absolute power and authority of God. It implies that no one can withstand God's judgment or oppose His will. This is reminiscent of the imagery in <a href="/job/41-10.htm">Job 41:10</a>, where God challenges Job, asking who can stand against Him. The phrase also connects to the eschatological themes in the New Testament, where the final judgment is depicted as a time when all will be held accountable before God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>, "For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?" This highlights the need for humility and repentance before God, recognizing that human strength and wisdom are insufficient in the face of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His sovereignty and the reverence due to Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a> is a celebration of God's deliverance of Israel, likely from a military threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_god.htm">Enemies of God</a></b><br>Implicit in the verse, representing those who oppose God and cannot stand before His wrath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord.htm">The Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>Understanding the fear of the Lord as a profound reverence and awe, not merely terror, is crucial for a right relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize God's ultimate authority over all creation.
