The act of giving thanks is not just a personal expression but a communal one, encouraging all believers to acknowledge God's sovereignty and goodness. In the context of ancient Israel, thanksgiving was often expressed through sacrifices and offerings at the temple, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>. This communal act of worship was central to Israelite culture and religious practice.<p><b>for His loving devotion</b><br>The term "loving devotion" is often translated from the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness. This concept is foundational in understanding God's covenant relationship with His people, as seen in His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It reflects God's unwavering commitment to His people despite their failures, as demonstrated throughout the history of Israel. This loving devotion is a type of Christ, who embodies God's ultimate act of love and faithfulness through His sacrifice on the cross.<p><b>and His wonders</b><br>The "wonders" refer to the miraculous acts of God, which serve as signs of His power and presence. In the Old Testament, these wonders include the parting of the Red Sea, the provision of manna, and the conquest of Canaan. These acts are not only historical events but also foreshadow the miracles of Jesus Christ, who performed signs and wonders to reveal His divine nature and authority. The wonders of God are a testament to His ability to intervene in human history and bring about His purposes.<p><b>to the sons of men</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of God's actions and blessings. While the immediate context of the Psalm may focus on Israel, the reference to "the sons of men" extends God's loving devotion and wonders to all humanity. This inclusivity is echoed in the New Testament, where the gospel is proclaimed to all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all peoples on earth will be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It underscores the theme of God's redemptive plan for all creation, culminating in the work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_men.htm">Sons of Men</a></b><br>A term referring to humanity in general, highlighting God's interaction and relationship with all people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to King David, who calls for thanksgiving and recognition of God's deeds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders</a></b><br>The miraculous acts and divine interventions performed by God, demonstrating His power and love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel's_deliverance.htm">Israel's Deliverance</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> recounts various instances of God's deliverance of Israel from distress, illustrating His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_as_a_response_to_god's_love.htm">Gratitude as a Response to God's Love</a></b><br>Recognize that thanksgiving is a natural response to experiencing God's loving devotion and wonders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_wonders.htm">Acknowledging God's Wonders</a></b><br>Reflect on the specific ways God has intervened in your life and the lives of others, and give thanks for these acts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_god's_love.htm">The Universality of God's Love</a></b><br>Understand that God's loving devotion extends to all humanity, inviting everyone to respond with gratitude.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_testimony.htm">The Importance of Testimony</a></b><br>Share testimonies of God's wonders in your life as a means of encouraging others and glorifying God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_a_thankful_heart.htm">Cultivating a Thankful Heart</a></b><br>Develop a habit of daily thanksgiving, recognizing God's ongoing work and presence in your life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_107_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 107:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_thank_the_LORD_daily_8.htm">How can we "give thanks to the LORD" in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Recent_examples_of_God_s_love.htm">What are examples of God's "loving devotion" you've experienced or witnessed recently?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_31_Eph_5_20_Gratitude_link.htm">How does Psalm 107:31 connect with Ephesians 5:20 about gratitude?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_recognize_God_s_wonders_locally_2.htm">Why is it important to recognize God's "wonders" in our community?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_recognizing_God_boost_faith.htm">How can acknowledging God's works strengthen our faith and witness to others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_31_God_s_love_and_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 107:31 reflect God's enduring love and faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_107_31.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 107:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_31_s_impact_on_gratitude_today.htm">How does Psalm 107:31 challenge modern views on gratitude and worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_107.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 107?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_celebrate_thanksgiving.htm">Should Christians participate in Thanksgiving celebrations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_envy_impact_peace_and_ties.htm">How does the Bible inspire creative expression?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_occurred_at_baal_of_peor.htm">What is the definition of lovingkindness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_humanity's_origin.htm">What does the Hebrew word 'hesed' mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 107:31 Mean</div><b>Let them give thanks</b><p>The psalmist calls for a response, not a suggestion.
