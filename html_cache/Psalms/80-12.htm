In biblical times, walls were crucial for the protection of vineyards from wild animals and thieves. The breaking down of walls signifies vulnerability and exposure to danger. This imagery is consistent with the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where protection was contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). Theologically, it suggests a period of divine judgment or discipline, possibly due to the nation's unfaithfulness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>, where God speaks of removing the hedge of protection around His vineyard due to Israel's disobedience.<p><b>so that all who pass by</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the ease with which outsiders can now access and exploit the vineyard. In the historical context, Israel was often surrounded by hostile nations. The phrase suggests a time when Israel's defenses were down, making it susceptible to invasion and plunder. This vulnerability can be seen during periods of Israel's history when they were conquered by foreign powers, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of turning away from God, leading to a loss of divine protection and favor.<p><b>pick its fruit?</b><br>The act of picking fruit symbolizes the exploitation and plundering of Israel's resources and blessings by foreign nations. In the agricultural society of ancient Israel, fruit was a sign of prosperity and divine blessing. The loss of fruit to passersby indicates a reversal of fortune and a loss of the blessings that were once abundant. This imagery can be connected to the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to others enjoying the fruits of Israel's labor. Prophetically, it points to the need for restoration and redemption, themes that are fulfilled in the coming of Jesus Christ, who restores and protects His people, as seen in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where He speaks of giving life abundantly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who has allowed the walls to be broken down.
