In biblical context, God's presence is often depicted as overwhelmingly bright and powerful, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a> when Moses' face shone after speaking with God. The brightness signifies purity, holiness, and the unapproachable light in which God dwells (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). This imagery is consistent with the theophanies in the Old Testament, where God's presence is accompanied by light and fire, symbolizing His majesty and power.<p><b>His clouds advanced</b><br>Clouds in Scripture often symbolize God's majesty and mystery. They are frequently associated with divine appearances, such as in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, where God leads the Israelites by a pillar of cloud. The advancing clouds suggest movement and action, indicating God's active involvement in the world. This imagery is also seen in the New Testament, where clouds are associated with the return of Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), symbolizing divine intervention and judgment.<p><b>hailstones and coals of fire</b><br>Hailstones and coals of fire are elements of divine judgment and power. In the biblical narrative, hailstones are used as instruments of God's wrath, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>) and the battle against the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>). Coals of fire further emphasize the destructive power of God's judgment, reminiscent of the fire and brimstone that rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). This imagery points to God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to use natural elements to accomplish His purposes. It also foreshadows the eschatological judgment described in Revelation, where fire is a recurring symbol of divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies, including King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as a powerful and majestic presence whose brightness and might are demonstrated through natural phenomena.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hailstones_and_coals_of_fire.htm">Hailstones and Coals of Fire</a></b><br>These elements symbolize God's judgment and power, often used in the Old Testament to demonstrate His might and authority over creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/theophany.htm">Theophany</a></b><br>This event refers to the manifestation of God in a visible form, often accompanied by natural phenomena like storms, as seen in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_realm.htm">Heavenly Realm</a></b><br>The setting from which God's presence and power emanate, affecting the earthly realm with His divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_majestic_presence.htm">God's Majestic Presence</a></b><br>The brightness of God's presence signifies His holiness and purity.

The phrase reminds us that God &#8220;wraps Himself in light as with a garment&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Light in Scripture often signals revelation, purity, and salvation. When God shows up in light, darkness&#8212;symbolic of evil and confusion&#8212;must retreat (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; In David&#8217;s personal rescue, this brightness makes clear that deliverance originates in God alone, not in human ingenuity (<a href="/2_samuel/22-13.htm">2 Samuel 22:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The same motif appears at Sinai, where thunder and lightning accompanied God&#8217;s self-revelation (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16&#8211;18</a>), underscoring His holiness and authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His clouds advanced</b><p>&#8226; Though radiant, God also veils Himself in clouds; both intimacy and mystery coexist. <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a> says, &#8220;Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne&#8217;s foundation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The advancing clouds convey movement&#8212;God is not distant but comes swiftly to defend His people (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Clouds in biblical narrative often accompany divine presence: the pillar of cloud in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and the cloud that filled Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, this image encourages confidence that God is actively moving toward us in our need, even when circumstances seem obscured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hailstones and coals of fire</b><p>&#8226; The storm imagery intensifies: God&#8217;s intervention is not merely scenic; it is decisive and formidable. Hail and fire describe literal, powerful judgments God has used before (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing signals comprehensive impact&#8212;what falls from above (hailstones) and what burns below (coals of fire). Nothing escapes His reach.<p>&#8226; Such descriptions assure the faithful that evil will be met with real, tangible response. <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a> asks, &#8220;Who can stand before His indignation?&#8221;; the implied answer is no adversary can.<p>&#8226; At the same time, God&#8217;s wrath against foes is mercy toward His own. As in the Red Sea deliverance (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-25</a>), the same presence that judges the enemy shelters the covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a> paints a vivid tableau of the Lord arriving in radiant light, cloaked clouds, and a storm of hail and fire. Each element highlights a facet of His character: light that reveals and saves, clouds that protect yet awe, and storm-force power that judges wickedness while rescuing the righteous. For every believer, the verse is a reminder that God&#8217;s presence is both breathtakingly glorious and unshakably protective, assuring us that when He comes, He comes in might to defend His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">At the brightness.</span>--This is obscure. Literally, <span class= "ital">From the brightness before him his clouds passed through </span>(Heb., <span class= "ital">avar</span>--LXX., <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">transierunt</span>)<span class= "ital"> hail and fiery coals. </span>In Samuel it is "From the brightness before him flamed fiery coals," which is the description we should expect, and, doubtless, gives the sense we are to attach to our text. Through the dark curtain of clouds the lightnings dart like emanations from the Divine brightness which they hide. The difficulty arises from the position of <span class= "ital">avaiv, </span>"his clouds," which looks like a subject rather than an object to <span class= "ital">avr-. </span>It has been conjectured, from comparison with Samuel, that the word has been inserted through error, from its likeness to the verb. If retained it must be rendered as object, "Out of the brightness of his presence there passed through his clouds hail and fiery coals." And some obscurity of language is pardonable in a description of phenomena so overpowering and bewildering as "a tempest dropping fire." A modern poet touches this feeling:--<p>"Then fire was sky, and sky fire,<p>And both one brief ecstasy,<p>Then ashes."--R. BROWNING, <span class= "ital">Easter Day.</span><p>In the Authorised Version the thought is of a sudden clearing of the heavens, which is not true to nature, and the clause "hailstones and coals of fire" comes in as an exclamation, as in the next verse. But there it is probably an erroneous repetition, being wanting in Sam. and in the LXX. version of the psalm. Notice how the feeling of the terrible fury of the storm is heightened by the mention of "hail," so rare in Palestine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the brightness that was before him his thick</span> <span class="cmt_word">clouds passed.</span> The "brightness" intended is probably that of lightning. The "thick clouds" are riven and parted asunder for the lightning to burst forth. Then come, almost simultaneously, hail stones and coals of fire; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hail like that which fell in Egypt before the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-34</a>), when "there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail" (ver. 24) - a fire which "ran along upon the ground," or some very unusual electrical phenomenon (see the comment on Exodus in the ' Homiletic Commentary,' p. 208). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/18-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the brightness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1490;&#1463;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7713;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
