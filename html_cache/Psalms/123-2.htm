This relationship was characterized by loyalty and trust, as the servant relied on the master's hand for sustenance and guidance. The imagery here reflects a posture of humility and dependence, emphasizing the servant's attentiveness to the master's will. Biblically, this can be seen in the relationship between God and His people, where believers are called to be attentive and obedient to God's commands, much like servants to their masters. This phrase also echoes the theme of servanthood found throughout Scripture, where Jesus Himself is described as the ultimate servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress</b><br>The mention of a maidservant highlights the gender-specific roles within the household structure of the time. Maidservants, like their male counterparts, were expected to be attentive and responsive to their mistress's needs and commands. This reflects a cultural context where women, though often in subordinate roles, played crucial parts in the functioning of a household. The imagery of looking to the hand suggests a readiness to act and a dependence on the mistress for provision and instruction. This can be paralleled with the church's relationship to Christ, where believers are called to be the bride of Christ, looking to Him for guidance and sustenance (<a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24</a>).<p><b>so our eyes are on the LORD our God</b><br>This phrase shifts the focus from human relationships to the divine, illustrating the psalmist's reliance on God. The use of "our" indicates a communal aspect, suggesting that this is not just an individual plea but a collective expression of dependence on God. The eyes being on the LORD signifies a posture of expectation and hope, trusting in God's character and promises. This is consistent with the biblical theme of looking to God for help and deliverance, as seen in other psalms (<a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>). It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He is their provider and protector.<p><b>until He shows us mercy</b><br>The plea for mercy underscores the psalmist's recognition of human frailty and the need for divine compassion. Mercy, in the biblical sense, involves God's loving-kindness and forgiveness, often in response to human repentance and humility. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's mercy towards His people, despite their shortcomings. The anticipation of mercy is a common theme in the Psalms, where the psalmists often cry out for God's intervention and grace (<a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate act of mercy in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross is the fulfillment of God's merciful plan for salvation (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_and_maidservants.htm">Servants and Maidservants</a></b><br>These individuals represent those who are in a position of dependence and service, looking to their masters for provision and direction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/masters_and_mistresses.htm">Masters and Mistresses</a></b><br>Figures of authority and provision, representing God in this analogy, to whom the servants and maidservants look for guidance and sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_our_god.htm">The LORD our God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the ultimate authority and source of mercy for the faithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the Psalm, who expresses a communal longing and dependence on God for mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mercy.htm">Mercy</a></b><br>The desired response from God, indicating His compassion and favor towards His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Just as servants depend on their masters, we are called to depend on God for our needs and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expectation_of_mercy.htm">Expectation of Mercy</a></b><br>Our posture should be one of hopeful expectation, trusting in God's character to show mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_and_patience.htm">Focus and Patience</a></b><br>Maintaining our focus on God requires patience and perseverance, especially in times of waiting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Recognizing our position as servants of God fosters humility and a willingness to serve Him faithfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayerful_attitude.htm">Prayerful Attitude</a></b><br>This verse encourages a prayerful attitude, continually looking to God in all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_123_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 123:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_123_2_Dependence_on_God_s_mercy.htm">How does Psalm 123:2 illustrate our dependence on God's mercy and guidance?
