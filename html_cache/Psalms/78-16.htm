In these accounts, God instructs Moses to strike a rock, resulting in water flowing out to quench the thirst of the Israelites. This event highlights God's power and provision, demonstrating His ability to meet the needs of His people in seemingly impossible situations. The rock is often seen as a type of Christ, as Paul notes in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where he states that the spiritual rock that followed them was Christ. This typology emphasizes Jesus as the source of living water, providing spiritual sustenance and life.<p><b>and made water flow down like rivers</b><br>The imagery of water flowing like rivers underscores the abundance and sufficiency of God's provision. In a desert context, where water is scarce, the idea of rivers flowing is a powerful symbol of God's generosity and care. This abundance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, where God promises to open rivers in desolate heights and fountains in the midst of valleys. The flowing water can also be seen as a metaphor for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as Jesus describes in <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>, where He speaks of rivers of living water flowing from within those who believe in Him. This connection highlights the transformative and life-giving power of the Spirit in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and provision for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he was the leader through whom God performed the miracle of bringing water from the rock.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's miraculous provision during their wilderness journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites experienced God's provision of water from the rock.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rock_at_horeb.htm">Rock at Horeb</a></b><br>The specific location where God instructed Moses to strike the rock to bring forth water (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs in miraculous ways, often beyond our understanding or expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_power.htm">Faith in God's Power</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to provide even in seemingly impossible situations, as He did for the Israelites in the wilderness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_water.htm">Symbolism of Water</a></b><br>Water from the rock symbolizes spiritual nourishment and life, pointing to Christ as the living water.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_faithfulness.htm">Obedience and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's provision often requires obedience and faithfulness, as seen in Moses' actions at Horeb.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_works.htm">Remembering God's Works</a></b><br>Reflect on and remember God's past faithfulness to strengthen our faith in current challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_16_God_s_provision_shown.htm">How does Psalm 78:16 demonstrate God's provision for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_streams_from_stone_show_God_s_power.htm">What does "brought streams from the stone" reveal about God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_in_today_s_challenges.htm">How can we trust God to provide in our current challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_78_16_to_Exodus_16_manna.htm">Connect Psalm 78:16 with another instance of God's provision in Scripture.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Psalm_78_16_daily.htm">How can we apply God's faithfulness in Psalm 78:16 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_16_God_s_power_over_nature.htm">How does Psalm 78:16 demonstrate God's power over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Which_events_does_Psalm_78_16_reference.htm">What historical events might Psalm 78:16 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_16_s_role_in_the_message.htm">How does Psalm 78:16 fit into the overall message of Psalm 78?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_78.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 78?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_psalm_78_stress_unverified_miracles.htm">Why does Psalm 78 emphasize miracles that lack corroboration in external historical records, such as water flowing from rocks?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_striking_a_rock_yield_water_for_all.htm">Numbers 20:2-11 - How could striking a rock realistically produce enough water for an entire nation and their livestock?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_jonathan's_covenant_with_david_inconsistent.htm">Does the nature of Jonathan's covenant with David in 1 Samuel 20:16 present any inconsistencies with later depictions of Israelite covenants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_did_david_become_king.htm">How did David rise from shepherd to king?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 78:16 Mean</div><b>He brought</b><p>- The verse opens with God Himself acting: &#8220;He brought &#8230;&#8221;
