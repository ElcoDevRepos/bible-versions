In the context of David's life, this authority was granted by God, who anointed him as king over Israel. The obedience of others upon hearing him can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). This authority can also be seen as a type of Christ, who commands obedience from all creation (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). The phrase suggests immediate compliance, indicating respect and recognition of divinely appointed leadership. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the power of God's word, which accomplishes what it sets out to do (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>foreigners cower before me.</b><br>The term "foreigners" refers to non-Israelite nations or peoples. Historically, David had many military victories over surrounding nations, such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Edomites, which led to their subjugation and fear (<a href="/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>). This phrase indicates the fear and submission of these nations in the face of God's chosen king. Culturally, it reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where kings often demonstrated their power through military conquest and the subjugation of foreign peoples. Prophetically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over all nations and powers, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15-16</a>, where every knee will bow to Him. The imagery of foreigners cowering also emphasizes the theme of God's sovereignty and the establishment of His kingdom through His anointed one.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies.

Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a>: &#8220;And David&#8217;s fame went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God had promised this very effect: &#8220;This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples under the whole heaven&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>).

The obedience of the nations shows God keeping His covenant promise to subdue David&#8217;s foes (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Examples in David&#8217;s life:<p>&#8211; The Philistines become subject after he inquires of the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8211; Moab, Edom, and Aram place garrisons under his rule (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; This foreshadows the greater King: &#8220;Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). One day &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine obedience flows from hearing.

David is experiencing the literal outworking of that promise.<p>&#8226; The word picture is of warriors dropping their weapons and bowing low. <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14&#8211;16</a> describes the same reaction after the Red Sea: Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Canaan all &#8220;trembled.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this anticipates Christ conquering hearts&#8212;sometimes by breaking pride, other times by graciously drawing them in. Either way, He rules. <a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a> foretells, &#8220;May desert tribes kneel before Him, and His enemies lick the dust.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-44.htm">Psalm 18:44</a> shows the Lord fulfilling His pledge to give David victory and global respect.
