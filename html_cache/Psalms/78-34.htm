The context of <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> is a recounting of Israel's repeated disobedience and God's corresponding acts of discipline. The "slaying" can be understood as divine retribution, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, such as in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12) or the punishment of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). This demonstrates God's holiness and justice, emphasizing that sin has consequences.<p><b>they would seek Him</b><br>In times of distress and judgment, the Israelites often turned back to God, seeking His mercy and deliverance. This pattern of behavior is seen throughout the book of Judges, where the Israelites repeatedly fall into sin, face oppression, cry out to God, and are delivered by a judge. Seeking God in times of trouble is a common biblical theme, highlighting human dependency on divine intervention. It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God remains faithful even when His people are not.<p><b>they repented</b><br>Repentance here involves a change of heart and a turning back to God. In the Hebrew context, repentance (teshuvah) is not merely feeling sorry but involves a complete transformation and return to God's ways. This is seen in the prophetic calls to repentance, such as in the messages of Isaiah and Jeremiah, where the prophets urge Israel to return to God to avoid impending judgment. Repentance is a key aspect of the covenant, where God promises restoration and forgiveness if His people return to Him.<p><b>and searched for God</b><br>This phrase indicates a deeper, more earnest pursuit of God, beyond mere ritualistic practices. Searching for God implies a sincere desire to know Him and align with His will. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, "You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart." It suggests a relational aspect of faith, where God desires a genuine connection with His people. This pursuit of God is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who provides the way to a restored relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the one who disciplines His people, leading them to repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are the recipients of God's discipline and who respond by seeking Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning back to God, which is a key theme in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_discipline.htm">Divine Discipline</a></b><br>The event of God "slaying" or disciplining His people to bring them back to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god.htm">Seeking God</a></b><br>The response of the Israelites to God's discipline, indicating a return to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_divine_discipline.htm">The Purpose of Divine Discipline</a></b><br>God's discipline is not punitive but redemptive, aimed at bringing His people back to a right relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_repentance.htm">The Heart of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a sincere turning back to God, not just a temporary change in behavior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god_in_times_of_trouble.htm">Seeking God in Times of Trouble</a></b><br>Difficult circumstances can be opportunities to seek God more earnestly and deepen our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithfulness_of_god.htm">The Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>Even when we stray, God remains faithful, using discipline to draw us back to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community_in_repentance.htm">The Role of Community in Repentance</a></b><br>As a community of believers, we can support one another in the journey of repentance and seeking God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_34_God_s_response_to_Israel.htm">How does Psalm 78:34 illustrate God's response to Israel's disobedience and repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_actions_when_Israel_sought_Him.htm">What actions did God take when Israel "sought Him" in Psalm 78:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_in_trials_today.htm">How can we apply the lesson of seeking God during trials today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_urge_seeking_God_in_distress.htm">What other scriptures emphasize seeking God in times of distress?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_34_Reflect_on_God_relationship.htm">How does Psalm 78:34 encourage us to examine our relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_turn_to_God_only_after_being_struck.htm">Why did God only turn people back to Him after striking them down in Psalm 78:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_suffering_needed_for_repentance_in_Ps_78_34.htm">Does Psalm 78:34 suggest that suffering is necessary for repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_34_and_God_s_love_align.htm">How does Psalm 78:34 align with the concept of a loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_78.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 78?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_divine_punishment_in_psalm_78_at_odds_with_a_loving_god.htm">Does the repeated theme of divine punishment in Psalm 78 conflict with the concept of a loving God found in other biblical passages?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_role_of_the_good_shepherd.htm">What is the role of the Good Shepherd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_leave_99_sheep_to_find_1.htm">Why would a shepherd risk leaving ninety-nine sheep to fend for themselves just to find one, as stated in Luke 15:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_spare_nineveh_but_not_the_plant.htm">Jonah 4:9 -

Each incident underscores:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness and right to judge sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Discipline designed to correct, not merely punish (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; A sobering reminder for believers today, echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-11</a>, that historical judgments warn us to flee idolatry and unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They would seek Him</b><p>Crisis jolted the people into spiritual awareness: &#8220;they would seek Him.&#8221; Scripture often shows affliction igniting renewed pursuit of God:<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;the Israelites cried out to the LORD&#8221; after oppression.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>&#8212;The LORD waits &#8220;until they admit their guilt and seek My face; in their distress they will earnestly seek Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4-6</a>&#8212;wanderers &#8220;cried out to the LORD in their trouble.&#8221;<p>Such turning is not mechanical; it reveals that underneath hardened hearts still lies a God-given knowledge of where help truly comes (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>).

It urges us to break that cycle&#8212;pursuing sincere, steadfast repentance that treasures God in both hardship and health, learning from Israel&#8217;s history to cultivate unwavering devotion today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he slew them, then they sought him</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/32-28.htm">Exodus 32:28, 35</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4, 10</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-48.htm">Numbers 16:48, 49</a>, etc.).
