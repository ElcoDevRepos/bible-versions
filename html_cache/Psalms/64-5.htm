Biblically, this reflects the nature of sin as described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where the thoughts of man's heart were only evil continually. The Hebrew word for "hold fast" suggests a strong grip or commitment, indicating that these individuals are not easily swayed from their intentions. This mirrors the stubbornness of Pharaoh in Exodus, who repeatedly hardened his heart against God's commands. Theologically, it underscores the concept of total depravity, where human nature is inclined towards sin without divine intervention.<p><b>they speak of hiding their snares.</b><br>The imagery of snares is common in the Psalms, often symbolizing traps set by the wicked to ensnare the righteous (<a href="/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a>). In ancient times, snares were used by hunters to catch animals, and metaphorically, they represent deceitful schemes. This reflects the cunning nature of evil, as seen in the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The act of hiding these snares suggests secrecy and deceit, akin to the Pharisees' plots against Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-4.htm">Matthew 26:4</a>). It also points to the spiritual warfare believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, where the devil's schemes are likened to traps.<p><b>&#8220;Who will see them?&#8221; they say.</b><br>This rhetorical question reveals the arrogance and false security of the wicked, believing their actions are hidden from both man and God. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>, where the wicked think God does not see or care about their actions. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's omniscience, as stated in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, where the eyes of the Lord are everywhere. Historically, this attitude can be seen in the behavior of those who opposed God's prophets, believing they could act without consequence. Theologically, it serves as a warning against the folly of underestimating God's awareness and justice, reminding believers of the ultimate accountability before God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/64.htm">Psalm 64</a>, David is expressing his concerns about the wicked and their secretive plots against the righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>- The individuals who are plotting evil and setting snares, as described in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>- Implicitly present as the targets of the wicked's schemes, representing those who follow God's ways.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/snares.htm">Snares</a></b><br>- Metaphorical traps set by the wicked to ensnare the righteous, symbolizing deceit and hidden dangers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- Although not directly mentioned in this verse, God is the ultimate judge and protector who sees all hidden actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_evil.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Evil</a></b><br>Evil often operates in secrecy, believing it can escape detection.

Both passages expose a will that has consciously chosen rebellion.<p>- By highlighting this resolve, David contrasts it with the steadfast love God expects of His people (<a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>). The psalm invites us to see that hearts can be &#8220;fixed&#8221; on righteousness or on evil, but never on both (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they speak of hiding their snares</b><p>- The wicked not only plan evil; they strategize secrecy.
