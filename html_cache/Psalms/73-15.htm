The psalmist is aware of the potential impact of his words, understanding that speaking out of his inner turmoil could lead others astray. This highlights the biblical principle of the power of words (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>) and the responsibility of leaders to guard their speech (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1-12</a>). The psalmist's restraint is an example of wisdom and self-control, virtues that are emphasized throughout Scripture.<p><b>then I would have betrayed Your children.</b><br>Here, the psalmist acknowledges the communal aspect of faith and the potential consequences of his actions on the faith community. "Your children" refers to the people of God, the Israelites, who look to leaders like Asaph for guidance and encouragement. The term "betrayed" suggests a deep sense of loyalty and responsibility to the community, echoing the covenant relationship between God and His people. This phrase underscores the importance of maintaining integrity and faithfulness, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph (Genesis 39) and Daniel (Daniel 6), who remained steadfast despite personal trials. The psalmist's concern for the spiritual well-being of others reflects the heart of Christ, who is the ultimate shepherd and guardian of His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite musician appointed by King David to lead worship in the tabernacle.
