In the biblical context, deliverance from death often signifies both physical and spiritual salvation. The Israelites experienced God's deliverance numerous times, such as during the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and in battles against their enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>). This deliverance is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms, highlighting God's role as a protector and savior. Theologically, this can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ's ultimate deliverance of humanity from spiritual death through His sacrifice and resurrection (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p><b>and keep them alive in famine</b><br>Famine was a common and severe threat in the ancient Near East, often resulting from drought, war, or locust plagues. God's provision during such times is a testament to His faithfulness and care for His people. The story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41-47</a> illustrates God's providence, as He used Joseph to prepare Egypt and surrounding nations for a coming famine, ultimately preserving the lives of many, including the Israelites. This phrase also reflects God's promise to sustain His people, as seen in Elijah's time when God provided for the widow of Zarephath during a drought (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-16</a>). Spiritually, it points to God's ability to sustain believers through times of spiritual drought, providing the "bread of life" through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>The verse speaks about those who fear the Lord and hope in His unfailing love.
