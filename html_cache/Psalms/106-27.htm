The dispersion, or diaspora, is a recurring theme where God allows His people to be scattered due to their failure to uphold the covenant. This is seen in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>). Theologically, it serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing God's justice and the seriousness of sin. The dispersion also foreshadows the spread of the Gospel to all nations, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>and scatter them throughout the lands</b><br>This scattering is both a literal and symbolic act of judgment. Historically, the Israelites were taken to various regions, losing their homeland and identity, which fulfilled prophecies like those in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. Culturally, this scattering led to the integration and influence of foreign customs and religions, which further distanced them from their covenant with God. However, it also set the stage for the eventual gathering and restoration, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>. This scattering can be seen as a type of Christ's mission to gather all people to Himself, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from Egypt but often fell into disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding pagan nations that Israel was warned against intermingling with, as they could lead them away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The event of being scattered among the nations, often seen as a consequence of Israel's disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader who brought the Israelites out of Egypt and through whom God gave the Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God can lead to severe consequences, including the loss of blessings and separation from God's intended purpose for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_judgment.htm">God's Faithfulness in Judgment</a></b><br>Even in judgment, God remains faithful to His covenant.

He is not merely allowing circumstances; He is actively sending His people away because of persistent rebellion (<a href="/psalms/106-16.htm">Psalm 106:16-26</a>). We can hear echoes of earlier warnings: &#8220;I will scatter you among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). The dispersal is discipline meant to turn hearts back, just as later prophets remind them, &#8220;The LORD will scatter you, but if you seek Him&#8230;He will restore you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their offspring</b><p>The judgment reaches beyond the original offenders to their descendants. Scripture often shows blessings and consequences flowing through generations (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>). Yet even here, God&#8217;s intent is redemptive: He preserves a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21-22</a>) so the covenant line continues despite exile. By addressing &#8220;offspring,&#8221; <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a> underscores that sin never stays private; it touches families and futures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Among the nations</b><p>Being placed &#8220;among the nations&#8221; removed the distinctive safeguards of life in the land. Israel would live amid people who worshiped other gods (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-15</a>). This fulfilled warnings that disobedience would land them under foreign rule (<a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>). At the same time, God used dispersion to make His name known globally (<a href="/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19-23</a>), foreshadowing the later gathering of peoples through the gospel (<a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And scatter them</b><p>The psalmist repeats the idea with a different verb, stressing total dislocation&#8212;families pulled apart, culture diluted. Similar imagery appears in <a href="/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>: &#8220;I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations.&#8221; The double wording shows the certainty and completeness of the sentence, leaving no pocket of resistance or refuge for sin to regroup.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Throughout the lands</b><p>The plural &#8220;lands&#8221; hints at wide dispersion&#8212;Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, and beyond (<a href="/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a>). Yet all these territories remain under God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Even when His people are far from Zion, He hears them (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3-19</a>) and promises return (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>). Thus the scattering prepares the stage for future regathering and ultimate restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-27.htm">Psalm 106:27</a> declares that God would drive Israel&#8217;s descendants far and wide because unrepentant sin makes separation necessary. The dispersal is comprehensive&#8212;offspring uprooted, nations witnessing, lands receiving the exiles. Still, every detail fits God&#8217;s covenant purposes: discipline that warns, mercy that preserves, and sovereignty that guides history toward redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/106.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Overthrow.</span>--This verse is evidently copied from <a href="/ezekiel/20-23.htm" title="I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;">Ezekiel 20:23</a>, but the psalmist has either intentionally or accidentally changed the prophet's verb "scatter" into "overthrow," just used in <a href="/psalms/106-26.htm" title="Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:">Psalm 106:26</a>.
