The mention of Zion hearing implies an awareness and acknowledgment of God's actions and decrees. In biblical context, Zion is frequently depicted as the dwelling place of God (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>) and the focal point of His redemptive work. The rejoicing of Zion signifies a response of joy and celebration, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promises and the manifestation of His righteousness. This joy is rooted in the assurance of God's sovereignty and His protective care over His chosen people.<p><b>and the towns of Judah exult</b><br>The towns of Judah, representing the southern kingdom of Israel, join in the celebration. Historically, Judah was the tribe from which King David came, and it held a special place in God's covenantal promises. The exultation of these towns indicates a collective response to God's righteous acts, emphasizing the unity and shared faith of the people. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of worship and the shared experience of God's deliverance and justice. The joy of Judah is often linked to the anticipation of the coming Messiah, who would arise from this region (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><b>because of Your judgments, O LORD</b><br>The judgments of the LORD refer to His righteous decrees and actions, which bring justice and order to the world. In the biblical narrative, God's judgments are seen as expressions of His holiness and truth, often resulting in the vindication of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked. This phrase underscores the belief that God's judgments are cause for celebration because they affirm His moral governance and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. The acknowledgment of God's judgments also points to the eschatological hope found in the prophetic writings, where God's final judgment will establish His kingdom in fullness (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, Zion represents the spiritual center of God's people, symbolizing God's presence and His covenant with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_judah.htm">Daughters of Judah</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the people of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel, often used to personify the cities and inhabitants of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgments_of_the_lord.htm">Judgments of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to God's righteous decrees and actions, which bring justice and vindication to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_righteousness.htm">Joy in God's Righteousness</a></b><br>The joy of Zion and the daughters of Judah is rooted in the recognition of God's righteous judgments.

When &#8220;Zion hears,&#8221; Scripture portrays a community attentive to the Lord&#8217;s voice and deeds (<a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s people are never left in the dark. His arrival, His victories, His proclamations reach their ears just as surely as a shepherd&#8217;s call reaches the flock (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>- Hearing is the soil in which faith grows (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). Zion&#8217;s readiness to listen shows a heart already turned toward the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rejoices</b><p>- Joy follows hearing because the news is good. <a href="/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him, and all the upright in heart will glory.&#8221;<p>- Biblical joy is not a vague feeling but a robust, covenant-rooted celebration&#8212;&#8220;I delight greatly in the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p>- &#8226; Joy springs from confidence that God&#8217;s rule benefits His people.<p>&#8226; Joy is a witness; rejoicing Zion testifies that the Lord is worthy (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy strengthens; &#8220;the joy of the LORD is your strength&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the towns of Judah exult</b><p>- The circle widens from the mountain of Zion to all Judah&#8217;s villages. God&#8217;s salvation never stays confined; it radiates outward (<a href="/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-17</a>).<p>- Collective praise underscores unity. As the disciples once &#8220;began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>), so the towns of Judah lift a shared shout.<p>- Exultation here is vigorous, public, and audible&#8212;a faith that overflows the heart and fills the streets (<a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of Your judgments, O LORD</b><p>- The cause of all this celebration is &#8220;Your judgments.&#8221; God&#8217;s decisions and acts are always right, always timely, always life-giving to His people (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>).<p>- His judgments vindicate the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>) and expose evil (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>). To rejoice in them is to love His righteous character (<a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3-4</a>).<p>- &#8226; God&#8217;s judgments display His wisdom (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p>&#8226; They secure His kingdom&#8217;s stability (<a href="/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>).<p>&#8226; They assure believers that justice, not chaos, has the final word (<a href="/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a> paints a contagious chain of praise: God speaks, Zion listens, joy erupts, surrounding towns join in, all because the Lord&#8217;s righteous judgments have broken into history.
