In the Old Testament, Israel is often depicted as God's chosen people, set apart from other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). This exclusivity is seen in the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, which was a covenant specifically with Israel (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The phrase underscores the special privileges and responsibilities that came with being God's chosen nation, including receiving His laws, guidance, and protection. Historically, Israel's distinct identity was maintained through practices such as circumcision, dietary laws, and Sabbath observance, which set them apart from surrounding nations.<p><b>they do not know His judgments.</b><br>The "judgments" refer to God's laws and decrees, which were revealed to Israel through the Torah. Other nations did not receive this direct revelation, which is why they are described as not knowing His judgments. This lack of knowledge often led to idolatry and practices contrary to God's will, as seen in the Canaanite nations that Israel encountered. The phrase also implies a lack of understanding of God's righteous standards and the moral and ethical guidelines that were intended to lead Israel into a life of holiness. In the New Testament, the concept of knowing God&#8217;s judgments is expanded to include all believers through the teachings of Jesus Christ and the apostles (<a href="/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12-16</a>).<p><b>Hallelujah!</b><br>This exclamation of praise, meaning "Praise the Lord," is a call to worship and gratitude for God's unique relationship with Israel. It serves as a reminder of the privilege of knowing God and His ways. In the broader biblical context, "Hallelujah" is used in the Psalms and Revelation to express joy and thanksgiving for God's mighty acts and faithfulness (<a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19:1-6</a>). It reflects a response of worship not only for what God has done for Israel but also for His ongoing work in the world through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and opens the way for all nations to know God (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who has given His laws and judgments to Israel, setting them apart from other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God to receive His laws and judgments, highlighting their unique relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_nations.htm">Other Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations who have not received God's laws and judgments in the same way Israel has.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgments.htm">Judgments (Mishpatim)</a></b><br>The Hebrew term "mishpatim" refers to God's ordinances or laws, which were given specifically to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hallelujah.htm">Hallelujah</a></b><br>A Hebrew word meaning "Praise the Lord," used here to conclude the verse with a call to worship and gratitude.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_privilege_of_revelation.htm">The Privilege of Revelation</a></b><br>Israel's receipt of God's laws is a profound privilege, underscoring the importance of valuing and adhering to divine revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God's selection of Israel demonstrates His sovereign will and purpose, reminding us of His authority and the grace extended to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_as_a_response.htm">Praise as a Response</a></b><br>The call to "Hallelujah" encourages believers to respond to God's unique gifts and revelations with praise and worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgments.htm">Understanding God's Judgments</a></b><br>While Israel was uniquely chosen, believers today are called to seek understanding of God's judgments through Scripture and the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>Although the verse highlights Israel's unique position, the New Testament reveals the inclusivity of the Gospel, inviting all nations to know God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_147_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 147:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_20_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">How does Psalm 147:20 highlight God's unique relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_justice_in_Ps_147_20.htm">What can we learn about God's justice from Psalm 147:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_20_Romans_9_4-5_link.htm">How does Psalm 147:20 connect to Romans 9:4-5 regarding Israel's privileges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Psalm_147_20_on_chosen_today.htm">How should Psalm 147:20 influence our understanding of God's chosen people today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Psalm_147_20_daily.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Psalm 147:20 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_reveal_laws_only_to_Jacob_in_Ps_147_20.htm">Why did God choose to reveal His laws only to Jacob in Psalm 147:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_20_God_s_bond_with_Israel_2.htm">How does Psalm 147:20 reflect God's relationship with Israel compared to other nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Theological_impact_of_Psalm_147_20.htm">What theological implications arise from God not dealing with other nations as in Psalm 147:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_147.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 147?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_view_human_strength.htm">(Psalm 147:10-11) How does God's supposed indifference to physical strength align with other biblical passages that celebrate or rely upon human might in battles and conquests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/psalm_149_6-9__swords_vs._god's_love.htm">Psalm 149:6-9 -

Paul later observes, &#8220;Theirs are the covenants and the giving of the Law&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>), highlighting Israel&#8217;s stewardship role in redemptive history.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s choice of Israel was never meant to foster pride but to create a channel through which blessing would reach all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they do not know His judgments</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Know&#8221; here is experiential; other nations had glimpses of God&#8217;s power in creation (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-20</a>) but lacked the intimate, covenantal knowledge Israel possessed.<p>&#8226; Without the revealed Law, the Gentile nations walked &#8220;in the futility of their thinking&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s plan always looked forward to extending that knowledge: &#8220;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>). The Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) fulfills this trajectory, bringing Gentiles into the blessings once limited to Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hallelujah!</b><p>&#8226; The psalm ends exactly where all theology should&#8212;worship.<p>&#8226; Praise flows naturally from recognizing God&#8217;s gracious self-disclosure.<p>&#8226; Believers today, whether Jew or Gentile, can echo &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; because in Christ &#8220;the dividing wall of hostility&#8221; is broken down and both have access to the Father (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/147-20.htm">Psalm 147:20</a> marvels that Israel uniquely received God&#8217;s word and judgments, a gift no other nation enjoyed at that time. This distinction highlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and Israel&#8217;s privileged role, while hinting at the broader plan to bless all peoples.
