In the biblical context, God's word is not just spoken language but a dynamic force that accomplishes His will. The concept of God's word being sent forth is seen in creation (Genesis 1) where God speaks the universe into existence. Theologically, this reflects the idea that God's word is active and effective, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where it is said that God's word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires. This also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>), indicating that God's ultimate communication and healing come through Christ.<p><b>and healed them;</b><br>Healing in the Bible often signifies both physical and spiritual restoration. In the historical context of Israel, healing was a sign of God's covenant faithfulness and mercy. The healing mentioned here can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, where God declares Himself as the healer of Israel. This phrase also connects to the ministry of Jesus, who healed many as a sign of the coming Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23-24</a>). The healing power of God's word is a testament to His compassion and desire to restore His people.<p><b>He rescued them from the Pit.</b><br>The "Pit" often symbolizes death, destruction, or Sheol, the realm of the dead, in the Old Testament. This phrase indicates deliverance from dire circumstances, reflecting God's power to save and redeem. In the cultural context, being rescued from the Pit would resonate with the Israelites' understanding of God's salvation history, such as the deliverance from Egypt. This also prefigures the ultimate rescue from death through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and offers eternal life (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>). The imagery of the Pit underscores the depth of God's saving grace and His ability to bring life from death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who sends forth His word to heal and rescue.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> suggests that the Israelites are the recipients of God's healing and rescue.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pit.htm">The Pit</a></b><br>Symbolic of danger, distress, or death, from which God rescues His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is not just informative but transformative.

That pledge echoes in this psalm as a fulfilled reality.<p>- Jesus embodied this same healing authority. A centurion believed, &#8220;Only say the word, and my servant will be healed&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a> assures us, &#8220;He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds,&#8221; showing that God&#8217;s care reaches both body and soul.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> anchors ultimate healing in the Messiah: &#8220;By His stripes we are healed.&#8221; The psalmist tastes that promise ahead of time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He rescued them from the Pit.</b><p>- &#8220;The Pit&#8221; pictures death, destruction, and utter hopelessness.
