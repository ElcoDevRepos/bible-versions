The concept of a heavenly register or book is found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, symbolizing God's knowledge and judgment. This register signifies inclusion in God's covenant community, transcending ethnic and national boundaries, and pointing to the ultimate gathering of believers from all nations.<p><b>&#8220;This one was born in Zion.&#8221;</b><br>Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, represents the spiritual center of God's kingdom. Being "born in Zion" implies a spiritual rebirth or adoption into God's family, not limited to physical descent. This reflects the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where all nations flow to the mountain of the LORD. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of spiritual rebirth in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a> and the concept of the heavenly Jerusalem in <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>. This phrase underscores the inclusivity of God's salvation plan, fulfilled in Christ, who unites all believers as citizens of the heavenly Zion.<p><b>Selah</b><br>Selah is a term used frequently in the Psalms, likely indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude. It invites the reader to meditate on the profound truth just expressed. In this context, it emphasizes the significance of God's sovereign choice and the spiritual heritage of being part of His people. This pause encourages contemplation of the eternal implications of being recorded in God's register and the privilege of spiritual birth in Zion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who is the central figure in this verse, emphasizing His authority and omniscience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term often used to refer to Jerusalem, the city of God, symbolizing His presence and the spiritual center of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the nations or groups of people outside of Israel, indicating the inclusivity of God's plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_register.htm">The Register</a></b><br>A metaphorical book or record that God keeps, signifying His knowledge and remembrance of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or emphasis on the preceding statement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_record-keeping.htm">God's Sovereign Record-Keeping</a></b><br>God knows and records those who belong to Him.
