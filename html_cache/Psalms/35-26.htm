In the cultural context of ancient Israel, public shame was a significant consequence, often more feared than physical punishment. The psalmist's call for his enemies to be "ashamed and confounded" aligns with the biblical principle of divine retribution, where God is seen as the ultimate judge who will vindicate the oppressed. This plea echoes the imprecatory nature of some psalms, where the psalmist seeks God's intervention against adversaries. The concept of being "ashamed" is frequently found in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/40-14.htm">Psalm 40:14</a>), indicating a reversal of fortune where the wicked are publicly humiliated. The idea of being "confounded" suggests a state of confusion and disarray, a common theme in biblical narratives where God intervenes to disrupt the plans of the wicked (e.g., the Tower of Babel in <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7-9</a>).<p><b>may those who exalt themselves over me be clothed in shame and reproach.</b><br>The imagery of being "clothed in shame and reproach" is a powerful metaphor in biblical literature, suggesting that shame becomes an intrinsic part of the individual's identity, much like clothing is to the body. In the historical context, clothing often symbolized one's status and identity; thus, to be "clothed in shame" implies a complete reversal of honor and status. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God humbling the proud and exalting the humble, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> and <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>. The psalmist's request for his enemies to be "clothed" in shame also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where the unrighteous will face eternal disgrace. This concept is further illustrated in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, in His teachings, often warned against pride and self-exaltation, emphasizing humility and servitude as the path to true greatness (e.g., <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The prophetic undertones in this plea highlight the eventual triumph of God's justice, where the righteous will be vindicated, and the wicked will face the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing a prayer for deliverance from his enemies.

(<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse reminds us to guard our own hearts against any satisfaction in another&#8217;s pain (<a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>be ashamed and confounded</b><p>David asks that the outcome of their gloating be shame and confusion.<p>&#8226;

Shame and confusion are fitting results for those who oppose God&#8217;s people, because opposing the people of God is opposing God Himself (<a href="/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The request is not petty revenge; it is a plea for God&#8217;s justice to be unmistakably displayed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may those who exalt themselves over me</b><p>The second half of the verse shifts focus to prideful oppressors.<p>&#8226; Self-exaltation is a path God repeatedly warns against (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoed the same truth: &#8220;Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; David stands as a type of the righteous sufferer, anticipating Christ, who endured mockery yet was ultimately exalted (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>be clothed in shame and reproach</b><p>The imagery of clothing paints shame as something visible and inescapable.<p>&#8226;

here it is dishonor, fitting the offense.<p>&#8226; The prayer trusts that God can reverse circumstances so thoroughly that the very ones who shamed David now wear shame themselves (<a href="/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>;

The verse underscores God&#8217;s commitment to vindicate His people, expose pride, and turn the tables on evil. For believers today, it calls us to shun gloating, resist pride, and rest in the certainty that God will ultimately uphold justice and clothe the unrepentant in the very shame they intended for His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt</span>: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me (camp. ver. 4, of which this is an enlargement, with variations, the sentiment being exactly the same).
