Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, was later falsely accused by Potiphar's wife and imprisoned. The bruising of his feet with shackles symbolizes the harsh treatment and injustice he endured. In ancient Egypt, prisoners were often bound in chains, a practice confirmed by archaeological findings of shackles from that era. This imagery also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was bound and led away to be crucified, as seen in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>).<p><b>and placed his neck in irons</b><br>The placing of Joseph's neck in irons indicates a further degree of humiliation and restraint. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, such treatment was reserved for those considered dangerous or guilty of serious crimes. This detail highlights the severity of Joseph's situation and the depth of his trials. It also serves as a type of Christ, who bore the weight of sin and was subjected to humiliation and suffering. The imagery of being bound in irons can be connected to the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who would endure great affliction for the sake of others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The verse refers to Joseph, the son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and later imprisoned in Egypt.

The grammar of the clause does not decide its sense with certainty; for its syntax is rather in favour of the Prayer Book Version, though the feminine form of the verb makes in favour of the marginal rendering. Symmachus has, "his soul came into iron;" the LXX., "his soul passed through iron." The Vulg., however, has the other Version, "the iron passed through his soul"--first found in the Targum. The parallelism is in favour of the Authorised Version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/105.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his soul entered into iron.</span> In Genesis nothing more is said than that Joseph "was bound" in the prison (<a href="/genesis/40-3.htm">Genesis 40:3</a>).
