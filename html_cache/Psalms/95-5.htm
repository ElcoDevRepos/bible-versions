The sea, often seen as a symbol of chaos in ancient Near Eastern cultures, is under God's control, highlighting His authority over all creation. <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a> describes God's creation of the seas, affirming His ownership. The sea's vastness and mystery are contrasted with God's intimate knowledge and command over it, as seen in <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>. This also prefigures Jesus' authority over nature, demonstrated when He calmed the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, showing His divine nature.<p><b>and His hands formed the dry land</b><br>This part of the verse underscores God's craftsmanship and intentionality in creation. The imagery of God's "hands" suggests a personal and deliberate act, contrasting with the impersonal forces of nature. <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a> also details the formation of dry land, reinforcing the idea of God's purposeful design. The dry land is essential for human habitation and sustenance, reflecting God's provision.
