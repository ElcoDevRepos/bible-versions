In biblical context, the term "wicked" often refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws and righteousness. The psalmist is observing the apparent prosperity of those who do not follow God's ways. This observation is a common theme in wisdom literature, such as in the Book of Job and Ecclesiastes, where the prosperity of the wicked is contrasted with the suffering of the righteous. The psalmist's use of "behold" serves to emphasize the surprising and troubling nature of this reality.<p><b>always carefree&#8212;</b><br>The phrase "always carefree" suggests a life without the burdens or concerns that typically accompany moral and spiritual accountability. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a carefree life was often associated with divine blessing, yet here it is paradoxically attributed to the wicked. This observation challenges the traditional understanding of retributive justice, where the righteous are rewarded, and the wicked are punished. The psalmist is grappling with the apparent contradiction between the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous, a theme that is also explored in the Book of Habakkuk.<p><b>as they increase their wealth.</b><br>The increase of wealth among the wicked is a central concern of the psalmist. In the historical context, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor, yet here it is possessed by those who defy Him. This accumulation of wealth by the wicked is a source of distress for the psalmist, as it seems to contradict the covenantal promises of blessing for obedience found in the Torah. The psalmist's lament echoes the sentiments found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/12.htm">Jeremiah 12:1-2</a>, where the prosperity of the wicked is questioned. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who warns against the deceitfulness of riches and the difficulty for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Asaph)</a></b><br>Asaph, a prominent Levite musician and seer in King David's court, is traditionally credited with writing <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>.
