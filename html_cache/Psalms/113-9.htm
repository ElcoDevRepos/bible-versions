In biblical times, barrenness was often seen as a curse or a sign of disfavor, as children were considered a blessing and a source of security. The story of Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-7</a>), Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>), and Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-24.htm">Luke 1:24-25</a>) are examples where God intervened to grant children to women who were previously barren. This act of settling the barren woman signifies God's ability to bring fulfillment and purpose, reflecting His compassion and sovereignty.<p><b>as a joyful mother to her children</b><br>The transformation from barrenness to motherhood is depicted as a source of joy. This joy is not just personal but communal, as children were integral to the family and community structure in ancient Israel. The joy of motherhood is celebrated in various scriptures, such as in the Song of Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/2.htm">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>), which praises God for His deliverance and blessings. This phrase also points to the spiritual fruitfulness that God can bring into the lives of His people, symbolizing the joy of spiritual rebirth and growth.<p><b>Hallelujah!</b><br>The psalm concludes with a call to praise, "Hallelujah," which means "Praise the Lord." This exclamation is a response to God's mighty acts and His faithfulness. It serves as a reminder that all blessings and transformations are reasons to worship and glorify God. The use of "Hallelujah" ties this verse to the broader context of the Psalms, which frequently call for praise in response to God's character and deeds. This phrase encapsulates the appropriate response of gratitude and worship for God's intervention and blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barren_woman.htm">Barren Woman</a></b><br>Represents women who are unable to have children, a condition often seen as a source of shame or distress in biblical times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_mother.htm">Joyful Mother</a></b><br>Symbolizes the transformation and blessing from God, turning sorrow into joy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/home.htm">Home</a></b><br>A place of security, belonging, and fulfillment, where the barren woman finds her new identity and purpose.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who enacts this transformation, demonstrating His power and compassion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hallelujah.htm">Hallelujah</a></b><br>A call to praise the Lord, emphasizing the response of gratitude and worship for His works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_compassion.htm">God's Sovereignty and Compassion</a></b><br>God has the power to change circumstances and bring joy where there was once sorrow.<br><br>Trust in God's timing and His ability to fulfill His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_and_new_identity.htm">Transformation and New Identity</a></b><br>God can transform our lives, giving us new purpose and identity.<br><br>Embrace the changes God brings, knowing they are for our good and His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_and_gratitude.htm">Praise and Gratitude</a></b><br>Our response to God's blessings should be one of praise and gratitude.<br><br>Regularly reflect on God's goodness and express thankfulness in all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_the_hopeless.htm">Hope for the Hopeless</a></b><br>God provides hope and fulfillment to those who feel empty or lacking.<br><br>Encourage others with the truth that God sees their struggles and can bring joy and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_113_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 113:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_113_9_God_s_compassion_for_barren.htm">How does Psalm 113:9 illustrate God's compassion towards the barren woman?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_113_9_show_God_s_power.htm">What does Psalm 113:9 teach about God's power to transform lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_timing_in_Psalm_113_9.htm">How can we trust God's timing in fulfilling promises, as seen in Psalm 113:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_Bible_stories_of_God_s_provision.htm">Which other biblical stories reflect God's provision for the childless?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_113_9_Hope_in_tough_times.htm">How can Psalm 113:9 inspire hope in challenging personal circumstances today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_113_9_God_s_transformative_role.htm">How does Psalm 113:9 reflect God's role in transforming lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_113_9_s_historical_context.htm">What historical context surrounds Psalm 113:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_113_9_and_divine_intervention.htm">How does Psalm 113:9 relate to the theme of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_113.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 113?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_faithful_remain_childless.htm">(Psalm 113:9) How can God&#8217;s promise to make the &#8220;barren woman&#8221; into a mother be taken literally in light of countless faithful individuals who remain childless despite prayers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_rachel_conceive_in_genesis_30.htm">In Genesis 30:22&#8211;24, why does Rachel&#8217;s miraculous conception coincide with this specific moment, and is there any historical evidence for such events?
