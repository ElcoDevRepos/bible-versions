In ancient Near Eastern cultures, horns were associated with the might of animals, such as bulls, and thus came to represent military power and authority. In this context, the horn signifies God's provision of strength and deliverance for His people. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a> and <a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>, where the horn is associated with salvation and the coming of a powerful deliverer, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to raise a mighty Savior for His people.<p><b>the praise of all His saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, His faithful followers. In the Old Testament, this primarily referred to the Israelites, but it extends to all who are in covenant with God. The phrase indicates that God's actions in raising a horn for His people result in praise from His saints. This reflects the biblical theme that God's mighty works and deliverance lead His people to worship and glorify Him. The saints' praise is a response to God's faithfulness and power, as seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1-2</a>, where the Israelites praise God after crossing the Red Sea.<p><b>of Israel, a people near to Him</b><br>Israel is described as a people "near to Him," highlighting the special covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. This nearness is not just geographical but relational, signifying intimacy and favor. In <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>, Moses emphasizes that no other nation has a god so near to them as the LORD is to Israel. This closeness is a result of God's choosing and calling Israel to be His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>. The concept of nearness also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of believers being brought near to God through Christ, as in <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>.<p><b>Hallelujah!</b><br>The term "Hallelujah" is a Hebrew expression meaning "Praise the LORD." It is a call to worship and an exclamation of joy and reverence. This word is used frequently in the Psalms, particularly in the concluding chapters, to invite all creation to join in the praise of God. It serves as a fitting conclusion to the verse, encapsulating the response of God's people to His mighty acts and His enduring faithfulness. The use of "Hallelujah" underscores the theme of universal praise that characterizes <a href="/psalms/148.htm">Psalm 148</a>, where all of creation is called to worship the Creator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who is praised for His mighty acts and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are recipients of His favor and blessings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_horn.htm">The Horn</a></b><br>Symbolizes strength and victory, often used in the Old Testament to denote power and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>The faithful followers of God, set apart for His purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, representing His covenant people who are near to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_strength_and_deliverance.htm">God's Strength and Deliverance</a></b><br>The "horn" symbolizes God's power and victory.

While poetically all the universe, inanimate as well as animate, all men, heathen as well as Hebrews, can be called to sing "hallelujah," it remains as it has ever been, the covenant privilege of Israel. This explanation disposes at once of the charge which has been brought against this verse of narrowing a grand universal anthem, and ending the psalm with an anti-climax.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/148.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He also exalteth the horn of his people</span>.
