The imagery of being swept away suggests suddenness and inevitability, akin to a flood or a powerful force that cannot be resisted. In biblical context, this can be seen as a reference to God's sovereignty over life and death, echoing themes found in other scriptures such as <a href="/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a> and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which speak of life as fleeting. The "sleep" here can symbolize death, a common metaphor in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a> where Jesus refers to Lazarus's death as sleep. This phrase underscores the idea that life is ultimately in God's hands, and human beings are subject to His will.<p><b>they are like the new grass of the morning&#8212;</b><br>The comparison to "new grass of the morning" highlights the temporary and fragile nature of human life. In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, grass would grow quickly with the morning dew but wither under the hot sun, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>. This imagery is used to convey the idea that human life, though it may appear vibrant and full of potential, is ultimately short-lived. The new grass can also symbolize renewal and the cycle of life, yet it remains ephemeral. This connects to the broader biblical theme of the fleeting nature of earthly life compared to the eternal nature of God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>. The phrase serves as a reminder of human mortality and the need to seek eternal significance through a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, experiencing God's provision and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for much of Moses' leadership, symbolizing both physical and spiritual testing and growth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_brevity_of_life.htm">The Brevity of Life</a></b><br>Life is fleeting and temporary, much like the morning grass that quickly withers.
