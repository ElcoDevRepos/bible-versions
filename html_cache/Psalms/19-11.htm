These divine instructions serve as a warning to God's servants, highlighting the importance of obedience and the consequences of disobedience. The concept of being warned by God's word is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>, which describes the commandment as a lamp and the law as light, providing reproofs of instruction as the way of life. The term "servant" underscores the relationship between God and His followers, emphasizing submission and dedication to His will. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s word as a guide and protector, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where it is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path.<p><b>in keeping them is great reward.</b><br>The "great reward" signifies the blessings and benefits that come from living in accordance with God's commandments. This reward is not merely material but encompasses spiritual fulfillment, peace, and eternal life. The idea of reward for obedience is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for those who diligently obey the voice of the Lord. The New Testament also reinforces this concept, with Jesus teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> about the great reward in heaven for those who endure persecution for righteousness' sake. The phrase suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between obedience and blessing, encouraging believers to adhere to God's laws with the assurance of His favor and the ultimate reward of eternal life with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
