In the context of the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to sin and disobedience (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>, <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>). However, it is not a permanent state. The Hebrew word for "fleeting" suggests something that is momentary or passing. This reflects God's character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "slow to anger" and "abounding in love." The temporary nature of His anger contrasts with the eternal nature of His love and mercy.<p><b>but His favor lasts a lifetime</b><br>God's favor, or grace, is enduring and steadfast. The concept of divine favor is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in the promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) and reiterated throughout the history of Israel. This favor is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign choice and love. The idea of a "lifetime" suggests a permanence and reliability that believers can trust in, echoing the assurance found in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are "new every morning."<p><b>Weeping may stay the night</b><br>This phrase captures the transient nature of sorrow. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, nighttime was often associated with danger and uncertainty, a time when fears and anxieties could be most pronounced. The imagery of weeping "staying the night" suggests that while sorrow is real and present, it is not permanent. This aligns with the biblical theme of God being a refuge and comforter in times of trouble, as seen in Psalms 34:17-18 and 56:8.<p><b>but joy comes in the morning</b><br>Morning symbolizes new beginnings and hope. The transition from night to morning reflects the transformative power of God's intervention in the lives of His people. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God turns mourning into joy (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>, <a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this promise is found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who conquered death and brought eternal joy to believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>). The assurance of joy in the morning serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the hope of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/30.htm">Psalm 30</a>, King David, is expressing gratitude for God's deliverance and mercy.
