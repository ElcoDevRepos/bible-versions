Samuel, as a seer, was recognized as a spiritual leader and intermediary between God and the people. This role is significant in the context of Israel's transition from a theocracy to a monarchy. Samuel's identification as a seer underscores his authority and the divine legitimacy of his actions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>, where all Israel recognized him as a prophet of the Lord.<p><b>&#8220;Go up before me to the high place,</b><br>High places were sites of worship, often located on elevated terrain. In Israelite culture, these were places where sacrifices and religious ceremonies were conducted. Samuel's instruction to go to the high place indicates a setting for worship and sacrifice, aligning with the cultural and religious practices of the time. This also foreshadows the sacrificial system that would be centralized in Jerusalem under King Solomon.<p><b>for you shall eat with me today.</b><br>Sharing a meal in the ancient Near East was a sign of fellowship and covenant. By inviting Saul to eat with him, Samuel is extending a gesture of hospitality and establishing a relationship. This meal is not merely social but has spiritual significance, as it precedes the anointing of Saul as king, symbolizing acceptance and divine favor.<p><b>And when I send you off in the morning,</b><br>The mention of sending Saul off in the morning suggests a time of preparation and transition. Mornings in biblical narratives often symbolize new beginnings or revelations. This phrase indicates that Saul's encounter with Samuel is a pivotal moment that will lead to a new phase in his life, aligning with the biblical theme of God orchestrating events in His timing.<p><b>I will tell you all that is in your heart.</b><br>This phrase highlights Samuel's prophetic insight and the divine revelation he possesses. It suggests that God has already revealed to Samuel the concerns and questions that Saul harbors. This assurance of divine knowledge and guidance is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God is depicted as knowing the innermost thoughts of individuals. Samuel's role as a prophet is to communicate God's will and provide clarity to Saul, setting the stage for Saul's anointing as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and the last judge of Israel, Samuel plays a crucial role in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

These words of courteous respect were addressed to Saul alone: "Go thou up before me." The prophet-judge then speaks to the two, Saul and his servant: "ye shall eat." The verb here is in the plural, and invites both to the sacrificial banquet; and then again Samuel confines his words to Saul: "I will tell thee all"--"all that is in thine heart." The seer informs him that on the morrow he proposes to make strange disclosures to this young man, who, all un knowing what lay before him, had just come up and accosted him, the aged judge and seer. Yes, he would on the morrow show this young Benjamite that he, Samuel, was indeed a seer; he would tell him all his secret thoughts and aspirations; as for those asses for whose fate he was so anxious, let him dismiss these from his thoughts altogether. They were already found. Far graver thoughts than the everyday weal and woe of a farm on Mount Ephraim had to be discussed on the morrow.<p><span class= "bld">All the desire of Israel.</span>--"All the desire of Israel," or, as the Vulg. renders it, "optima quaeque Israel," "the best in Israel" (Luther). The words do not signify the desire of Israel--all that it <span class= "ital">desires</span>--but all that it possesses of what is precious or worth desiring. The obscure dark words of the seer on this, the occasion of his first meeting with Saul, were intended to draw him away from thinking about the asses and the little matters which hitherto had filled his life, and to lift him up to higher thoughts and aspirations. The old seer's words were vague and indefinite, certainly, but coming as they did from the lips of one so high in dignity, known to be the possessor of many a strange secret of futurity hid from the knowledge of mortal men, and holding out a prospect of undreamed of future glory for Saul, amazed the young man; and he, full of wonderment and awe, replied, "Speakest thou of such glories to me, a member of an unimportant family of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go up before me.</span> Addressed in the singular to Saul, to whom, as the future king, Samuel pays every mark of honour. The next words, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat,</span> include Soul's servant. <span class="cmt_word">I will tell thee all,</span> etc. Intended not merely to set Soul's mind at rest, but also to prepare him for the great news he was to hear. So, too, the information that the asses were found, given to him before he had even hinted at the object of his visit, would convince him of the reality of Samuel's prophetic powers. <span class="cmt_word">On whom is all the desire of Israel?</span> Rather, "To whom belongs all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for thy father's house?" The words were intended to indicate to Saul, though in an obscure manner, that the supreme power in Israel would be his. Why trouble about she-asses? They might be beautiful, and a valuable property for a husbandman;but he was about to become a king, to whom would belong everything that was best and most precious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">am the seer,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
