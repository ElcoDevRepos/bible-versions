This reflects the cultural norm where servants were trusted members of a household, sometimes possessing wisdom and insight. The servant's initiative suggests a level of faith and awareness of spiritual matters, which is crucial in the narrative of Saul's anointing.<p><b>&#8220;in this city there is a man of God who is highly respected;</b><br>The "man of God" refers to the prophet Samuel, who was a pivotal figure in Israel's history. Prophets were seen as intermediaries between God and the people, and Samuel was particularly respected for his integrity and leadership. The city mentioned is likely Ramah, Samuel's hometown, which was a center for prophetic activity. This respect indicates Samuel's established reputation as a reliable and authoritative voice of God.<p><b>everything he says surely comes to pass.</b><br>This phrase underscores the reliability and divine authority of Samuel's prophetic words. In <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>, the test of a true prophet is that their predictions come true, affirming Samuel's authenticity. This also foreshadows the fulfillment of God's plans through Samuel's guidance, including the anointing of Saul as king.<p><b>Let us go there now.</b><br>The urgency in the servant's suggestion highlights the importance of seeking divine guidance. This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek out prophets or divine insight during times of uncertainty or decision-making, emphasizing the value placed on spiritual direction.<p><b>Perhaps he will tell us which way to go.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects the belief that prophets could provide specific guidance for personal and national matters. The phrase "which way to go" can be seen as both literal, in finding the lost donkeys, and metaphorical, in discerning God's will for Saul's future. This anticipates the unfolding of God's plan for Saul, who is about to be anointed as Israel's first king, a significant turning point in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys.

The servant points out to him the tower of the then famous residence of the seer and judge, Samuel. "Will you not ask him," suggests the servant, "about the missing beasts?"--the young countryman, in the simplicity of his heart, thinking the occasion of the loss of his master's asses a sufficient one to warrant an intrusion upon the prophet-judge of Israel. The relation, however, between Samuel and the people must have been of a very close and friendly nature, else it would never have occurred, even to a simple countryman--as probably <span class= "ital">then </span>Saul's servant was--to have sought the advice of one so great as Samuel in such a matter. It says, too, much for the old prophet's kindly, unselfish disposition that his name was thus loved and honoured, even in the secluded farms of the Land of Promise.<p><span class= "bld">An honourable man.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">one held in honour.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this city.</span> Probably Ramathaim-zophim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ramah, Samuel's dwelling place and property. Confessedly, however, Saul's route hither and thither in search of lost cattle is very obscure, and it is difficult to reconcile this identification with the statement in <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, that Rachel's sepulchre lay on the route between this city and Gibeah of Saul. Nevertheless, Ramah was certainly in the land of Zuph, whence too it took its longer name (see on 1 Samuel 1:1); and it is remarkable that Jeremiah (1 Samuel 31:15) describes Rachel's weeping as being heard in Ramah. It seems extraordinary that Saul should have known nothing of Israel's chief ruler, and that his servant was acquainted with him only in his lower capacity as a person to be consulted in private difficulties. He describes him, nevertheless, as <span class="cmt_word">an honourable man,</span> or, more literally, an honoured man, one held in honour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said the servant,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
