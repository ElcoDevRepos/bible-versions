Helmets were crucial for soldiers, especially for those in leadership or champion roles, like Goliath. The mention of a bronze helmet signifies Goliath's status as a formidable warrior. In biblical symbolism, the head often represents authority and leadership, and the helmet's protection could symbolize Goliath's confidence in his own strength and invulnerability. This contrasts with the spiritual armor described in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where the "helmet of salvation" is emphasized, highlighting reliance on God rather than physical armor.<p><b>He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels,</b><br>The coat of mail, also known as a scale armor, was made of overlapping bronze plates, providing both flexibility and protection. Weighing five thousand shekels, approximately 125 pounds, it underscores Goliath's immense size and strength, as only a giant could bear such weight. This detail emphasizes the seemingly insurmountable challenge David faced. The heavy armor symbolizes the reliance on human strength and military might, contrasting with David's trust in God. This narrative foreshadows the New Testament theme of God's power being made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).

Just as the &#8220;helmet of salvation&#8221; guards believers&#8217; minds (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>), Goliath trusted a physical helmet to secure his head.<p>&#8226; Bronze, a strong and lustrous metal, reflected the Philistine champion&#8217;s confidence in human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). His gleaming helmet would catch the sun, striking fear in Israel&#8217;s ranks (<a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often describes God&#8217;s enemies as boasting in visible might&#8212;yet God counters by saving &#8220;not with sword or spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Goliath&#8217;s helmet stands as a tangible reminder that worldly security cannot replace the Lord&#8217;s protection (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels</b><p>&#8226; This coat of mail&#8212;about 125&#8211;150 pounds&#8212;underscores the sheer bulk of Goliath&#8217;s defenses. The text affirms an actual historical weight, highlighting how formidable he appeared (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8211; The weight dwarfs even Saul&#8217;s royal armor, which David later declines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38&#8211;39</a>), showing a stark contrast between human fortification and faith.<p>&#8226; Bronze scale armor covered Goliath &#8220;from neck to knees,&#8221; a picture of total reliance on man-made protection. Yet Scripture repeatedly shows God piercing what seems impenetrable (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>; <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail foreshadows the victory to come: one smooth stone will bypass all this armor, proving &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>). In spiritual terms, earthly defenses&#8212;however massive&#8212;cannot withstand divine intervention (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a> vividly paints Goliath&#8217;s imposing armor to contrast human might with God&#8217;s power.

This coat of mail, or corselet, was flexible, and covered the back and sides of the wearer. The weight of the different pieces of the giant's panoply largely exceeds the weight of mediaeval suits of armour.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he wore a bronze</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1433;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5178.htm">Strong's 5178: </a> </span><span class="str2">Copper, something made of that metal, coin, a fetter, base</span><br /><br /><span class="word">helmet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
