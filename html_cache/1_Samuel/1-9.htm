Shiloh was where the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant were located, making it a central place of worship and pilgrimage. The context here is the annual pilgrimage for sacrifice and worship, a time of communal feasting and celebration. The act of eating and drinking signifies the completion of the sacrificial meal, a common practice in ancient Israelite worship, reflecting fellowship with God and the community. This setting underscores the religious and cultural backdrop of Hannah's story, highlighting the significance of her actions in a sacred space.<p><b>Hannah stood up</b><br>Hannah's action of standing up is significant, indicating a decisive moment and a shift from passive participation to active engagement. In the cultural context, standing up could symbolize readiness to speak or act, often associated with prayer or petition. Hannah's standing contrasts with the earlier scene of feasting, suggesting a transition from communal celebration to personal supplication. Her resolve to stand and pray reflects her deep personal anguish and determination to seek God's intervention in her barrenness, a condition that carried social stigma and personal grief in ancient Israel.<p><b>Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair</b><br>Eli, the high priest, is introduced here, highlighting his role as a religious authority in Shiloh. His sitting position may indicate his role as a judge or overseer, as sitting was a common posture for teaching or judging in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Eli's presence at the tabernacle underscores the religious significance of the location and the events unfolding. His later interactions with Hannah reveal his initial misunderstanding of her actions, yet ultimately, he becomes a conduit for God's blessing upon her.<p><b>by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD</b><br>The reference to the "temple of the LORD" here refers to the tabernacle, as the permanent temple in Jerusalem had not yet been built. The doorpost signifies the entrance to the sacred space, a place of transition between the secular and the divine. This location is significant as it represents a threshold where human petitions meet divine presence. The mention of the doorpost may also evoke imagery of the Passover, where doorposts were marked with blood, symbolizing protection and deliverance. Hannah's prayer at this threshold foreshadows her pivotal role in the birth of Samuel, who would become a key figure in Israel's history, anointing its first kings and serving as a prophet and judge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who is deeply distressed due to her barrenness.

The verse frames her forthcoming prayer as an act rooted in covenant worship, personal resolve, and reverence for God&#8217;s appointed order. It reminds us that earnest petitions are most potent when birthed from lives already engaged in grateful, obedient fellowship with the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">After they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.</span>--This was the solemn sacrificial meal, at which the whole family were present.<p><span class= "bld">Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat.</span>--Eli, the high priest of Israel at this time, was a descendant of Ithamar, the younger son of Aaron (see <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm" title="And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.">1Chronicles 24:3</a>, where it is stated that his great-grandson, Ahimelech, was of the sons of Ithamar). The circumstances which led to the transfer of the dignity from the line of Eleazar, who succeeded his father Aaron in the office, are unknown. It has been suggested that at the death of the <span class= "ital">last high </span>priest of the line of Eleazar, Ozi, there was no son of sufficient age and experience to succeed, and so the office passed to the next of kin, Eli, a son of the house of Ithamar. (See Josephus, <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span>, 2, ? 5.)<p>The seat upon which Eli is represented as usually sitting (see <a href="/1_samuel/4-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.">1Samuel 4:18</a>) was evidently a chair or throne of state, where the high-priestly judge sat at certain times to administer justice and to transact business. The Hebrew word rendered here "post," and the expression "doors of the house" (<a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm" title="And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.">1Samuel 3:15</a>), seem to suggest that now a permanent home had been erected for the sanctuary: something of a building, possibly of stone, surrounding the Tabernacle had been built.<p>The "temple of the Lord," rather, <span class= "ital">palace of the Lord, </span>so called not from any external magnificence but as being the earthly place where at times the visible glory of the Eternal King of Israel, the Shekinah, was pleased to manifest itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After they had eaten .... after they had drunk.</span> The Hebrew favours the translation, "After she had eaten in Shiloh, and after she had drunk;" the somewhat forced rendering of the A.V. having arisen from a supposed discrepancy between this verse and ver. 7. Really there is none. The words simply mean that Hannah took part in the sacrificial banquet, though she did so without appetite or pleasure; and thus they connect her visit to the temple and her prayer with the most solemn religious service of the year. To take part in this banquet was a duty, but as soon as she had fulfilled it she withdrew to the temple to pour out her grief before God. There Eli, <span class="cmt_word">the priest,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the high priest, as in <a href="/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-2.htm">Numbers 27:2</a>, was seated upon, not a seat, but <span class="accented">the</span> pontifical throne, placed at the entrance leading into the inner court of the tabernacle, so that all who came to worship must pass before him. It is remarkable that the tabernacle is called the <span class="accented">temple</span> (so <a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), or, more literally, the "palace" of Jehovah, his royal residence; and it thus appears that the name had come into use before Solomon's building was erected. The curtains (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>) also had given place to a <span class="accented">mezuzah</span>, translated <span class="accented">a post</span>, but really a sort of porch, with doors, as appears from <a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a> (comp. <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-5.htm">1 Kings 7:5</a>). As the tabernacle remained stationary at Shiloh for 300 years, naturally numerous buildings of a more solid nature grew up around it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had finished eating</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
