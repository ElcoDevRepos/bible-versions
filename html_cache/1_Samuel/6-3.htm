The Philistines were seeking guidance on how to return the Ark of the Covenant to Israel after it had brought plagues upon them. This reflects the ancient practice of consulting religious leaders for divine insight.<p><b>&#8220;If you return the ark of the God of Israel,</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Its capture by the Philistines was a significant event, and its return was crucial for Israel. The Philistines recognized the power associated with the Ark, acknowledging it as belonging to the God of Israel, which shows their awareness of its religious significance.<p><b>do not send it away empty,</b><br>This instruction reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of appeasing deities with offerings. Sending the Ark back with gifts was an attempt to placate the God of Israel, acknowledging their understanding of divine retribution and the need for atonement.<p><b>but by all means return it to Him with a guilt offering.</b><br>A guilt offering was a specific type of sacrifice in the Levitical law, meant to atone for unintentional sins and to make restitution. The Philistines' decision to include a guilt offering indicates their recognition of having offended the God of Israel and their desire to make amends, even though they were not under the Mosaic Law.<p><b>Then you will be healed,</b><br>The Philistines were suffering from plagues, which they attributed to the presence of the Ark. The promise of healing upon returning the Ark with a guilt offering suggests a belief in the direct intervention of the divine in human affairs, a common belief in the ancient world.<p><b>and you will understand why His hand has not been lifted from you.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "His hand" refers to God's power and judgment. The Philistines were experiencing God's wrath, and the return of the Ark with a guilt offering was seen as a way to gain insight into their suffering and to potentially end it. This reflects the biblical theme of understanding divine actions through repentance and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

By ordering a guilt offering with the ark, they acknowledge their offense and seek mercy. The verse underscores that the LORD&#8217;s hand disciplines until sin is owned and addressed, but He stands ready to heal when His justice is honored.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Send it not empty.</span>--The advice was to propitiate with gifts the powerful Hebrew Deity, whom they imagined was offended and angry at the insult offered Him--the being placed in an inferior position in the Dagon temple.<p>The priests and diviners evidently thought that the Hebrew Deity, in some way resident in the "golden chest," was a childish, capricious deity, like one of their own loved gods--Dagon, or Beelzebub, lord of flies. Their people had insulted Him; He had shown Himself powerful enough, however, to injure His captors, so the insults must cease, and He must be appeased with rich offerings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A trespass offering.</span> The offering that was to be made when the offence had been unintentional (<a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Why his hand is not removed from you.</span> A euphemism for "why your punishment continues to be so severe, without sign of abatement." If healing follows the gift, you will know that the malady was Jehovah's doing. The trespass offering was to consist of <span class="cmt_word">five golden emerods, and five golden mice,</span> it being an old heathen custom, still constantly practised abroad, of presenting to the deity tokens representing the deliverance wrought for such as had implored his aid. Thus Horace ('Carm.,' 1:5) speaks of the custom of hanging up in the temple of Neptune the clothes in which a man had escaped from shipwreck. Slaves when manumitted offered their chains to the Lares; and the idea is so natural that we cannot wonder at its prevalence. <span class="cmt_word">One plague was on you all.</span> Rather, "is on you all." It did not cease until the ark had been restored. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">on them all</span>; but as all the versions and several MSS. read <span class="accented">you all</span>, the substitution of them is probably the mistake of some transcriber. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
