Ramah was Samuel's hometown, located in the territory of Benjamin. Saul's journey to Naioth was driven by his intent to capture David, who had sought refuge there. This reflects Saul's increasing desperation and paranoia as he pursued David, whom he saw as a threat to his throne. The geographical setting underscores the tension between Saul and David, as Ramah was a place of spiritual significance, being associated with the prophet Samuel.<p><b>But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul,</b><br>The phrase highlights the sovereignty and power of God, who can influence anyone, even those with hostile intentions. The Spirit of God coming upon Saul is reminiscent of earlier instances in Saul's life when he was chosen and anointed as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>). This divine intervention serves as a reminder of God's control over human affairs and His ability to redirect actions according to His will. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in believers' lives.<p><b>and he walked along prophesying</b><br>Prophesying here indicates that Saul was speaking under the influence of the Spirit, possibly uttering praises or messages from God. This involuntary act of prophesying demonstrates that God's Spirit can override human intentions. It also serves as a temporary transformation of Saul, contrasting with his usual behavior driven by jealousy and anger. This event parallels the earlier episode in <a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11</a>, where Saul's prophesying surprised those who knew him, suggesting a divine interruption in his pursuit of David.<p><b>until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</b><br>Saul's prophesying continued until he reached his destination, indicating the sustained influence of the Spirit over him. This prolonged state of prophesying prevented Saul from carrying out his plan to capture David, showcasing God's protection over David. The repetition of "Naioth in Ramah" emphasizes the significance of this location as a place of divine encounter and prophetic activity. It also highlights the futility of opposing God's anointed, as seen in the broader narrative of David's rise and Saul's decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is experiencing a decline in his spiritual and mental state due to his disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naioth.htm">Naioth</a></b><br>A place in Ramah where a group of prophets, including Samuel, were gathered.

Saul&#8217;s arrival there brings him face-to-face with God&#8217;s own appointed messenger rather than merely with David.<p>&#8226; By recording Saul&#8217;s movement in straightforward geographical terms, Scripture underscores the historical reliability of the account (cf. <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows Saul to proceed physically, but each step is leading the king into a setting entirely under divine control, preparing the way for the next intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul</b><p>&#8220;But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; This same phrase had marked Saul&#8217;s earlier, positive experiences with God (<a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6, 10</a>; 11:6). Now, despite Saul&#8217;s hardened rebellion, the Spirit still sovereignly overrules him.<p>&#8226; The wording &#8220;even Saul&#8221; highlights the surprise: the king who has drifted far from obedience is nevertheless subject to God&#8217;s power (cf. <a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a> with Balaam; <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-51</a> with Caiaphas).<p>&#8226; God is not endorsing Saul&#8217;s character but asserting dominion over him. The Spirit can fall on a disobedient person to fulfill divine purposes, just as He raises up or restrains rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment protects David without violence: God disarms Saul by turning the pursuer into a prophetic instrument, demonstrating both mercy and judgment simultaneously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophesying begins on the road and continues &#8220;until&#8221; arrival, indicating an extended, uncontrollable state (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Such prophetic utterance&#8212;likely praise or declaration of God&#8217;s greatness&#8212;renders Saul incapable of carrying out his hostile intent (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>, where similar prophetic activity foreshadows this event).<p>&#8226; God turns the hunter into a herald; Saul&#8217;s mouth glorifies the very God he is defying. Like Balaam blessing Israel instead of cursing (<a href="/numbers/23-11.htm">Numbers 23:11-12</a>), Saul is compelled to speak what God allows.<p>&#8226; The episode publicly exposes Saul&#8217;s impotence before God and vindicates David&#8217;s anointing, reinforcing to onlookers that divine calling outstrips royal decree (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; In halting Saul without a sword, the Lord shows that the battle belongs to Him (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul marches to Naioth intent on capturing David, yet every step is orchestrated by God. The same Spirit who once equipped Saul to rule now overtakes him, proving that no human rebellion can thwart divine sovereignty. Forced into prophetic speech, Saul becomes an unwitting witness to God&#8217;s supremacy and a living shield for David. The verse reminds us that God can arrest evil intentions, redirect rulers, and use even the disobedient to declare His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Saul went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
