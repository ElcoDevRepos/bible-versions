The context is a confrontation between David and King Saul. David has just spared Saul's life for the second time, demonstrating his respect for God's anointed king despite Saul's pursuit of him. This ongoing dialogue reflects David's patience and persistence in seeking reconciliation and understanding.<p><b>&#8220;Why is my lord pursuing his servant?</b><br>David addresses Saul with respect, calling him "my lord," which acknowledges Saul's position as king. The term "servant" reflects David's humility and his previous role in Saul's court. This question highlights the unjust nature of Saul's pursuit, as David has consistently shown loyalty. The pursuit is a result of Saul's jealousy and fear, as seen in earlier chapters where Saul becomes increasingly paranoid about David's rising popularity and God's favor upon him.<p><b>What have I done?</b><br>David's question is rhetorical, emphasizing his innocence. Throughout 1 Samuel, David's actions have been honorable, and he has not committed any offense against Saul. This question invites Saul to reflect on his actions and the baselessness of his accusations. It also echoes the broader biblical theme of the innocent suffering unjustly, a motif seen in the lives of other biblical figures such as Joseph and ultimately Jesus Christ.<p><b>What evil is in my hand?</b><br>The phrase "in my hand" suggests actions or deeds. David is asserting that he has not committed any wrongdoing or evil act against Saul. This is significant because David had the opportunity to kill Saul but chose not to, demonstrating his integrity and trust in God's justice. The imagery of the hand is often used in scripture to symbolize power and action, and here it underscores David's restraint and righteousness. This restraint foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who advocated for love and forgiveness towards one's enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.
