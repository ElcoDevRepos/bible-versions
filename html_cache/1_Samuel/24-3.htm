Sheepfolds were enclosures used by shepherds to protect their flocks, indicating this was a common grazing area. Saul, the first king of Israel, was pursuing David, who had been anointed by Samuel as the future king. This pursuit highlights the tension between Saul's declining reign and David's rise. The road suggests a well-traveled path, emphasizing the strategic location of the encounter.<p><b>where there was a cave</b><br>Caves in this region were often used as shelters or hideouts due to their natural formation. The mention of a cave is significant as it provides a setting for a pivotal moment in David's life. Caves in biblical narratives often symbolize places of refuge or divine encounters, as seen with Elijah at Mount Horeb. This cave becomes a place of testing for David, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God using wilderness experiences to shape His leaders.<p><b>and he went in to relieve himself</b><br>This detail humanizes Saul, showing his vulnerability and the mundane aspects of life even for a king. It also sets up the dramatic irony of the situation, as Saul is unaware of David's presence. The act of relieving oneself in a cave underscores the privacy Saul sought, contrasting with the public nature of his pursuit of David. This moment of vulnerability is a turning point, offering David an opportunity to harm Saul, which he ultimately refrains from doing, demonstrating his respect for God's anointed.<p><b>And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave</b><br>David's presence in the cave with his men highlights his status as a fugitive and leader of a loyal band of followers. The "recesses" suggest a deeper part of the cave, indicating strategic positioning and the providential nature of their hiding place. This scenario is a test of David's character and leadership, as his men urge him to seize the opportunity to kill Saul. David's decision to spare Saul's life reflects his faith in God's timing and justice, aligning with the biblical principle of respecting God's anointed and foreshadowing Christ's teaching on loving one's enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

This particular cave sits within that rocky region, prepared in advance as a hidden shelter (<a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is striking: Saul sees only a dark hollow; David sees a God-provided hiding place (<a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he went in to relieve himself</b><p>&#8226; Scripture states the action plainly.

Earthly authority cannot shield anyone from dependence on bodily needs.<p>&#8226; By allowing this unguarded moment, the Lord removes Saul&#8217;s defenses, proving that He alone &#8220;brings princes to nothing&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>) and sets the stage for David&#8217;s choice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s band had already entered the cave&#8217;s deepest parts.

In that land and among these Eastern peoples, whose customs change so little, they are as common now as they were then. "These sheepcotes are generally made by piling up loose stones in front of the cave's entrance in a circular wall, which is covered with thorns as a further protection against thieves and wild animals who would prey on the sheep. During cold storms and in the night the flocks retreat into the cave, but at other times they remain in the enclosed cote. . . . These caverns are as dark as midnight, and the keenest eye cannot see four paces <span class= "ital">inward; </span>but one who has been long within, and looking <span class= "ital">outward </span>toward the entrance, can observe with perfect distinctness all that takes place in that direction. David, therefore, could watch Saul as he came in . . . but Saul could see nothing but impenetrable darkness."<p>From this thorny fence, so universal in the countless sheepcotes of Palestine, was very possibly derived a quaint simile in the strange passage on "Death" in the Talmud:--<p>"The hardest of all deaths is by a disease (some suppose quinsey), which is like the <span class= "ital">forcible extraction of prickly thorns from wool. . . .</span> The easiest of all deaths is the Divine kiss, which is like the extracting of hair from milk. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam died by this Divine kiss."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Berachoth, </span>fol. 8, col.1.<p><span class= "bld">Where was a cave.</span>--The well-known traveller Van de Velde wishes to identify the cave in question with an immense cavern in a rock with many side vaults, near the ruins of Chareitum; the difficulty is, however, that this vast cavern is fifteen or twenty miles from Ain-jedy. In this cave all David's band could well have been gathered: not only his 600 fighting men, but the camp followers and women also. In Pocock we read that the Arabs call this cavern Elmaama (hiding-place), and relate how on one occasion thirty thousand people hid themselves in it to escape an evil wind (the simoom). It is, however, quite possible that the incident about to be related, connected with Saul and David, took place in one of the much smaller caves close to En-gedi. It is not necessary to assume that <span class= "ital">all </span>David's band were with him in one cave. A hundred or so of his more special companions were probably with him on this occasion, the remainder of the little army being dispersed in other similar refuges in the immediate neighbourhood.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul went in to cover his feet.</span>--The meaning of this disputed passage is quite simple. Saul, fatigued with the morning's march, some time about midday withdrew--probably with a very few attendants composing his personal staff--to take a short siesta, or sleep, in one of those dark, silent caves on the hill-side, which offered a cool resting-place after the glare and heat of a long and fatiguing march along the precipitous paths of the region. He lay down, no doubt, near the cave's mouth, and one of his faithful attendants threw lightly over the king's feet the royal many coloured mantle (<span class= "ital">m'il</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The king and his attendants little suspected that in the dark recesses of their midday resting-place were concealed the dreaded freebooter and a great company of his devoted armed followers. As explained in the Note above, in these great rock recesses, coming from <span class= "ital">outside, </span>from the glare of daylight, not five paces forward can be seen, but those already <span class= "ital">inside, </span>and accustomed to the darkness, can, at a considerable distance within the cave, see distinctly all that takes place in the neighbourhood of the cavern mouth. The sharp eyes of David's sentinels, no doubt, far in the cave, quickly saw the little party of intruders. The tall form of the king, his jewelled armour, and perhaps his many-coloured brightly-tinted cloak, betrayed to the amazed watchmen of David the rank of the wearied sleeper.<p>This interpretation of the words. <span class= "ital">"</span>Saul went in to cover his feet"--namely, "to sleep"--is adopted by the Peshito Syriac Version, Michaelis, and of late, very positively, Ewald. The ordinary interpretation of the words, besides being an unusual statement, by no means suits the narrative; for it must be remembered that considerable time was necessary for the sentinel to inform David, and for David to have approached and cut off the hem of the royal garment, and again to have retired into the recesses of the cave.<p><span class= "bld">In the sides of the cave.</span>--That is, in the side vaults and passages which exist in the largest of these natural refuges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came to the sheepcotes.</span> Rather, "to sheepcotes," there being no article in the Hebrew.

These caverns are as dark as midnight, and the keenest eye cannot see five paces <span class="accented">inward</span>; but one who has been long within, and is looking <span class="accented">outward</span> toward the entrance, can observe with perfect distinctness all that takes place in that direction. David, therefore, could watch Saul as he came in, and notice the exact place where he "covered his feet," while Saul could see nothing but "impenetrable darkness." <span class="cmt_word">To cover his feet.</span> The Syriac understands this of sleeping; more correctly the Vulgate and Chaldee take it as in <a href="/judges/3-24.htm">Judges 3:24</a>, margin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Soon Saul came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
