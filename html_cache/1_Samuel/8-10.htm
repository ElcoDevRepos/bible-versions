His role was crucial in conveying God's messages, emphasizing the importance of prophetic leadership in Israel. This phrase highlights Samuel's obedience and faithfulness in delivering God's words, a characteristic of true prophets throughout the Bible.<p><b>all the words of the LORD</b><br>This indicates that Samuel did not alter or withhold any part of God's message. The completeness of the message underscores the seriousness of the divine warning. It reflects the biblical principle that God's word is authoritative and must be communicated fully, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a>.<p><b>to the people</b><br>The people of Israel, who were distinct from other nations due to their covenant relationship with God, were the recipients of this message. This phrase underscores the communal aspect of Israel's identity and their collective responsibility to heed God's word. It also reflects the democratic nature of their request, as it was a popular demand rather than a decision by a few leaders.<p><b>who were asking him for a king</b><br>The Israelites' request for a king marked a significant shift in their governance, moving from a theocracy to a monarchy. This desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>) was seen as a rejection of God's kingship. The request foreshadows the eventual establishment of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

The elders have demanded, &#8220;Appoint a king to judge us&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). God has told Samuel to listen to them&#8212;yet with a clear caveat: &#8220;Solemnly warn them and show them the manner of the king&#8221; (v. 9).<p>&#8226; &#8220;So&#8221; signals immediate obedience. This is Samuel moving directly from God&#8217;s instruction to public proclamation&#8212;no delay, no editing (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>, &#8220;At once they left their nets&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It also underlines cause and effect: their request for a king triggers God&#8217;s warning. Just as Israel&#8217;s grumbling in <a href="/bsb/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a> led to forty years in the wilderness, this request launches a new chapter with weighty consequences (see <a href="/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel</b><p>The seasoned prophet&#8211;judge stands between heaven and the nation.<p>&#8226; From childhood, Samuel has been known for an ear tuned to God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) and a mouth that lets &#8220;none of His words fall to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; As the last judge (<a href="/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>) and a prophet counted with Moses (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>), he embodies spiritual leadership that Israel is about to exchange for political monarchy.<p>&#8226; His faithful example echoes later messengers like John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2&#8211;3</a>) who prepare people for a shift in God&#8217;s dealings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>spoke</b><p>Prophets don&#8217;t freelance; they relay.<p>&#8226; Speaking is the primary prophetic task (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s words are oral Scripture-in-the-making, delivered to ears before they ever reached parchment.<p>&#8226; His example teaches that truth must be articulated, not merely contemplated (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the words</b><p>Nothing filtered out, nothing watered down.<p>&#8226; Like Paul later declaring &#8220;I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole will of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), Samuel holds back no detail of the impending costs of monarchy (vv. 11&#8211;18).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people thrive on every word, not selective sound bites (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Complete disclosure is an act of love, because half-truths leave hearts unprepared.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the LORD</b><p>The content is divine, not Samuel&#8217;s personal opinion.<p>&#8226; Authority rests in the Source: &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; frames true prophecy (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By attaching God&#8217;s name to the warning, Samuel removes any excuse for dismissal. Rejecting the message now equals rejecting the Lord Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus models the same pattern: &#8220;I have spoken everything the Father has told Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the people</b><p>The entire congregation, not merely the elders, needs to hear.<p>&#8226; Public reading and explanation of God&#8217;s word are baked into Israel&#8217;s life (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Everyone affected by the coming king deserves to know God&#8217;s perspective, from tribal leaders to ordinary farmers.<p>&#8226; Corporate accountability means no one can later claim ignorance when royal taxation and conscription arrive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were asking him for a king</b><p>Their persistent demand shapes the message&#8217;s tone.<p>&#8226; The request itself was foreseen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, but their motive&#8212;&#8220;that we may be like all the other nations&#8221; (v. 20)&#8212;exposes a drift from trusting God as King (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment is less about political structure and more about spiritual substitution: trading divine reign for human rule.<p>&#8226; God will grant their wish (<a href="/1_samuel/8-22.htm">1 Samuel 8:22</a>) yet package it with sobering consequences, echoing <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God &#8220;gave them over&#8221; to their desires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10</a> captures Samuel&#8217;s faithful obedience: he immediately delivers every syllable God has given, confronting a nation eager to trade covenant kingship for cultural conformity. By highlighting the divine origin, complete content, and intended audience, the verse models prophetic ministry and warns that demanding our own way may bring results we soon regret.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
