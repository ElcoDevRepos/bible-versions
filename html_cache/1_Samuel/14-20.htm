Saul, the first king of Israel, was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, including the Philistines, who were a constant threat. The assembling of troops indicates a call to arms, a common practice in ancient warfare where the king would rally his forces for battle. This moment follows Jonathan's bold attack on the Philistine outpost, which had already caused panic among the Philistines. The gathering of troops also reflects the unity and readiness of Israel to confront their adversaries, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament where God often calls His people to stand together against their enemies.<p><b>and they found the Philistines in total confusion</b><br>The confusion among the Philistines can be seen as a divine intervention, a recurring theme in the Bible where God causes chaos among the enemies of Israel to ensure victory for His people. This confusion is reminiscent of other biblical battles, such as Gideon's victory over the Midianites in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, where God caused panic among the enemy forces. The Philistines' confusion could also be attributed to the unexpected attack by Jonathan and his armor-bearer, which disrupted their ranks and morale. This moment underscores the power of God to influence the outcome of battles, often turning the tide in favor of Israel despite overwhelming odds.<p><b>with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor</b><br>This phrase describes the self-destructive chaos that ensued among the Philistines. Such internal conflict is a common motif in biblical narratives, where God uses the enemies' own strength against them. The imagery of soldiers turning on each other highlights the complete breakdown of order and discipline within the Philistine camp. This phenomenon is not only a testament to the psychological impact of fear and confusion but also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over the affairs of nations. The self-destruction of the Philistines parallels other instances in Scripture where God causes the enemies of Israel to fight among themselves, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a> during Jehoshaphat's reign. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their adversaries, a theme that finds its fulfillment in the New Testament with the triumph of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

In such a scene of confusion the charge of Saul, at the head of his small but well-trained soldierly band, must have done terrible execution.
