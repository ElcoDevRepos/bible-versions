Abigail's offering is a strategic act of diplomacy, reflecting wisdom and humility. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>, which speaks of a gift pacifying anger.<p><b>your servant has brought</b><br>Abigail refers to herself as a servant, demonstrating humility and respect. This self-identification as a servant is reminiscent of the humility shown by Christ, who came to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>to my lord</b><br>The term "lord" here is a title of respect, acknowledging David's future role as king.

Abigail arrives at David&#8217;s camp right when anger is about to erupt into bloodshed (<a href="/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21-22</a>). &#8220;Now&#8221; marks the turning point God orchestrates, much like Queen Esther&#8217;s timely entrance before the king (<a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1-2</a>).<p>- Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s providence through seemingly small timing words&#8212;compare &#8220;But God&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a> or &#8220;At once&#8221; in <a href="/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33</a>. Here, &#8220;Now&#8221; reminds us that the Lord can redirect an entire storyline in a single instant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let this gift</b><p>- Abigail offers tangible provisions&#8212;bread, wine, sheep, grain, raisins, and figs (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>). A gift can soothe tension; <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a> notes, &#8220;A man&#8217;s gift opens the way for him.&#8221;<p>- Like Jacob&#8217;s pacifying present to Esau (<a href="/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>), this gesture seeks reconciliation, acknowledging David&#8217;s grievance without excuses for Nabal&#8217;s insult.<p>- The material present pictures a spiritual truth: God&#8217;s people use whatever resources they have to promote peace (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your servant has brought</b><p>- Abigail twice calls herself &#8220;your servant&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-24.htm">1 Samuel 25:24, 28</a>). She models humility reminiscent of Ruth before Boaz (<a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>).<p>- By owning the act&#8212;&#8220;has brought&#8221;&#8212;she assumes responsibility, contrasting her husband&#8217;s arrogance (<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10-11</a>).<p>- <a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a> says wisdom is &#8220;peace-loving, considerate, submissive.&#8221; Abigail embodies that wisdom, acting rather than waiting for someone else to fix the crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to my lord</b><p>- She addresses David with a title that recognizes his future kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; 25:30). Though Saul still sits on Israel&#8217;s throne, Abigail sees God&#8217;s anointing on David.<p>- In <a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8 and 26</a>:19, David himself used &#8220;my lord&#8221; for Saul; now the term is rightly returned to him.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> teaches respect for God-appointed leaders; Abigail&#8217;s words anticipate that principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>be given</b><p>- Abigail asks David to accept the offering freely. The phrase echoes <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a> where Jacob urges Esau, &#8220;Please accept my blessing that was brought to you.&#8221;<p>- Acceptance would signify reconciliation and end plans for vengeance&#8212;aligning David with God&#8217;s law against personal revenge (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>- The invitation also tests David&#8217;s heart: will he receive grace or cling to anger?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the young men</b><p>- David&#8217;s followers, described earlier as &#8220;about four hundred men&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), have endured hardship and deserve provision (<a href="/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15-16</a>).<p>- <a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> lists them as distressed and indebted; now they taste the fruit of God&#8217;s care through Abigail&#8217;s generosity.<p>- Jesus later multiplies loaves for His disciples (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>), showing the same shepherd&#8217;s concern for hungry followers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who follow you.</b><p>- &#8220;Follow&#8221; underscores loyalty. These men stand with David despite Saul&#8217;s hostility, anticipating the church&#8217;s call to follow Christ regardless of cost (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p>- Abigail&#8217;s words therefore bless not just David but everyone aligned with God&#8217;s chosen leader. Compare <a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>, where the men of Judah anoint David king; their allegiance channels further blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abigail&#8217;s sentence&#8212;&#8220;Now let this gift your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow you&#8221;&#8212;is a Spirit-guided bridge between wrath and mercy. Each phrase highlights God&#8217;s timely intervention, the power of humble generosity, rightful honor toward His anointed, and practical care for those who stand with Him. The verse teaches believers to act swiftly for peace, submit humbly, recognize God-appointed leadership, and bless fellow servants, trusting that such obedience turns potential disaster into kingdom progress.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">This blessing.</span>--That is to say, <span class= "ital">gift. </span>Of this Abigail makes little account--it was simply an expression of her homage and good will. It was not intended, of course, for David, but for his company; but she brought it, as is the custom in the East where an inferior approaches a superior, whether as a visitor or as a suppliant, to bring in the hand gifts.
