Mizpah was a significant location in Israelite history, often serving as a gathering place for the people. It was a site of national assembly and religious significance, where Samuel had called the Israelites to repent and seek the Lord. The Philistines, hearing of this assembly, likely perceived it as a potential threat or a sign of rebellion, prompting their military response.<p><b>their rulers marched up toward Israel</b><br>The Philistine rulers, or lords, were the leaders of the five major city-states: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza. These rulers often coordinated military actions against Israel. The phrase "marched up" indicates a movement from the coastal plains where the Philistines resided, up into the hill country of Israel, suggesting a strategic military advance. This movement reflects the ongoing conflict and tension between the two nations.<p><b>And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines</b><br>The Israelites' fear of the Philistines was rooted in their previous defeats and subjugation under Philistine control. Historically, the Philistines had superior military technology, including iron weapons and chariots, which contributed to Israel's fear. This fear also highlights Israel's vulnerability and their need for divine intervention, setting the stage for Samuel's leadership and God's deliverance. The Israelites' fear contrasts with their later faith and reliance on God, as seen in subsequent verses and chapters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Israel&#8217;s movements, just as they had done since the earlier defeats at Ebenezer (<a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Mizpah was the place where Samuel called Israel to repent, pour out water, fast, and confess sin (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5&#8211;6</a>). A repentant, unified Israel posed a spiritual and military threat, reminding the Philistines of God&#8217;s previous interventions such as at the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>) and Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment shows that genuine revival often draws immediate opposition; when God&#8217;s people gather to seek Him, the enemy pays attention (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rulers marched up toward Israel</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;their rulers marched up toward Israel.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>b)<p>&#8226; The Philistine strategy involved a swift, pre-emptive strike, mobilizing &#8220;rulers&#8221; (five lords, as in <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>) to crush any hint of Israelite resurgence.<p>&#8226; They had relied on similar rapid assemblies before (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>), trusting chariots and iron weaponry (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4&#8211;7</a>) rather than the Lord.<p>&#8226; God permitted their advance to test Israel&#8217;s renewed faith, much like He tested Judah with Sennacherib&#8217;s invasion centuries later (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-1.htm">2 Chronicles 32:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even hostile movement can fit within God&#8217;s sovereign plan; He later turns this march into Israel&#8217;s victory (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10-13</a>), echoing His pattern in <a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israelites feared</b><p>&#8220;And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>c)<p>&#8226; Their fear was natural; memories of prior defeats (<a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10</a>) and occupations (<a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7-9</a>) were still fresh.<p>&#8226; Yet their fear now drove them toward dependence on the Lord instead of panic. They appealed to Samuel for intercessory prayer (<a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>), mirroring Jehoshaphat&#8217;s cry centuries later (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear isn&#8217;t sin when it turns the heart God-ward. David experienced similar dread yet confessed, &#8220;When I am afraid, I will trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God would use this fear to showcase His deliverance, distinguishing it from earlier times when Israel relied on the Ark as a talisman (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a> captures a pivotal moment in Israel&#8217;s renewal. As soon as God&#8217;s people gathered in repentance at Mizpah, the Philistines reacted with military force, and Israel reacted with fear. The verse sets the stage for God to turn that fear into faith, proving His power over oppressors. It reminds believers today that earnest devotion often provokes opposition, yet every threat is an opportunity for the Lord to display His saving strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The lords of the Philistines went up against Israel.</span>--This was what might naturally have been expected. The sudden destruction of the Ph?nician idol shrines throughout the country, followed immediately by the summons of a vast popular assembly, held in so conspicuous a place as Mizpeh in Benjamin aroused at once the warlike nation which had so long kept Israel in servitude. The Philistine leaders promptly assemble a powerful force, and proceed to interrupt the Mizpeh gathering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</span> This was perfectly natural, and implied no intention on the part of the Israelites not to fight it out. No dominant nation would permit a subject race to hold such a meeting as Samuel's at Mizpah without having recourse to arms; but the Philistines acted with such promptness and vigour as brought home to the assembled Israelites not merely the conviction that they would have to fight, but that they must do it at once, and with the combined forces of the enemy. In spite, nevertheless, of their fears, they determine to await the attack, and that this decision was taken in faith their own words prove. For they say, <span class="cmt_word">Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> The words literally are, "Be not silent from crying," etc. Let him mediate for them with God, and they will await the onslaught of the foe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
