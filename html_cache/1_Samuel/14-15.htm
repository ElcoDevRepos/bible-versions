The panic that struck them was a divine intervention, as the Philistines were known for their military prowess and would not easily be frightened. This event is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where God causes confusion among Israel's enemies, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a> during the crossing of the Red Sea. The mention of the camp and field indicates a widespread panic affecting both the organized military and the general populace, highlighting the totality of the chaos.<p><b>Even those in the outposts and raiding parties trembled.</b><br>The outposts and raiding parties were strategic military positions meant to secure territory and resources. The fact that even these seasoned warriors trembled suggests a supernatural fear, as these were likely the most battle-hardened and confident of the Philistine forces. This trembling can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to fight for Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>, where God assures His people of His presence in battle.<p><b>Indeed, the earth quaked, and panic spread from God.</b><br>The earthquake serves as a physical manifestation of God's power and presence, similar to other biblical events where God uses natural phenomena to achieve His purposes, such as the shaking of Mount Sinai in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>. The phrase "panic spread from God" underscores the divine origin of the fear, emphasizing that this was not a mere coincidence but a deliberate act of God to deliver His people. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as a warrior who fights on behalf of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>, where God confuses and defeats Israel's enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, whose faith and courage in attacking the Philistine outpost initiated the events leading to the panic.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_army.htm">Philistine Army</a></b><br>The enemy of Israel, stationed in various locations, including camps, fields, and outposts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_army.htm">Israelite Army</a></b><br>Initially fearful and hiding, they are the beneficiaries of the panic that God sends upon the Philistines.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>The location where Saul and the Israelite army were stationed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/panic_sent_by_god.htm">Panic Sent by God</a></b><br>A divinely orchestrated event causing confusion and fear among the Philistines, leading to their defeat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God is sovereign and can intervene in human affairs to accomplish His purposes.
