In the ancient Near East, the arrival of a prophet could be alarming, as prophets often brought messages of judgment. Samuel's assurance of peace would have been comforting to the elders of Bethlehem. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's messengers bringing peace, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, which speaks of those who proclaim peace and salvation.<p><b>&#8220;I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, serving as a means of atonement and fellowship with God. Samuel's purpose was to offer a sacrifice, which was a common practice for seeking God's favor or guidance. This act also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself for the sins of humanity, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.<p><b>Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.&#8221;</b><br>Consecration involved purification rituals, such as washing and abstaining from certain activities, to prepare oneself for worship. This reflects the holiness required to approach God, a theme echoed in <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a> when the Israelites prepared to meet God at Mount Sinai. The call to consecration underscores the importance of spiritual readiness and purity.<p><b>Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons</b><br>Samuel's act of consecrating Jesse and his sons highlights the significance of their participation in the sacrifice. This preparation was necessary for them to be in the presence of God. Jesse's family, particularly David, plays a crucial role in God's plan, as David is anointed king in this chapter. David's lineage is significant in biblical prophecy, leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, as noted in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>.<p><b>and invited them to the sacrifice.</b><br>The invitation to the sacrifice signifies inclusion in a significant religious event. It also sets the stage for David's anointing, a pivotal moment in Israel's history. This invitation mirrors the broader biblical narrative of God inviting humanity into a covenant relationship with Him, ultimately fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who invites all to partake in the new covenant through His sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord, tasked with anointing the next king of Israel.
