This phrase indicates a moment of reflection and decision-making. David's words are a response to the insult and refusal of hospitality by Nabal, a wealthy but foolish man. This context highlights David's human emotions and the challenges he faces in leadership and justice.<p><b>&#8220;In vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the wilderness.</b><br>David and his men had been acting as a protective force for Nabal's shepherds and flocks in the wilderness of Paran. This protection was not a formal agreement but a common practice of mutual benefit in ancient Near Eastern culture. David's statement of "in vain" reflects his frustration and sense of betrayal, as he expected some form of compensation or gratitude for his services.<p><b>Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing,</b><br>David emphasizes the integrity and effectiveness of his protection. In a time and place where theft and raids were common, David's assurance that nothing was lost under his watch speaks to his leadership and the discipline of his men. This also underscores the righteousness of David's actions compared to Nabal's ingratitude.<p><b>yet he has paid me back evil for good.</b><br>This phrase captures the moral and ethical tension in the narrative. David's good deeds are met with Nabal's evil response, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture. This concept of repaying evil for good is addressed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>, which encourage believers to respond to evil with good.

He is processing an offense before acting on it. Scripture lets us overhear the moment temptation to vengeance ignites (cf. <a href="/psalms/73-21.htm">Psalm 73:21-22</a>: &#8220;When my heart was grieved&#8230; I was senseless and ignorant&#8221;). We watch how quickly a servant of God can slip from trust to fury. This snapshot warns us that righteous people still battle raw emotion (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s patrols had ring-fenced Nabal&#8217;s flocks (<a href="/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; He feels his kindness produced zero return&#8212;&#8220;in vain.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase exposes a heart leaning toward works-based expectations: &#8220;I did good, so I deserve good.&#8221; Yet <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> teaches, &#8220;Do not withhold good&#8230; when it is within your power.&#8221; Obedience is never wasted even when unrecognized (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing</b><p>Integrity is underscored. David, leading six hundred hungry fugitives, never pilfered a sheep (cf. <a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-34</a> where Paul similarly safeguards his testimony). The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; Faithful stewardship amid lack.<p>&#8226; Credibility grounds future leadership; small decisions shape the king David will become (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet he has paid me back evil for good</b><p>The injustice stings. David echoes the lament later captured in <a href="/psalms/109-5.htm">Psalm 109:5</a>, &#8220;They repay me evil for good.&#8221; Nabal&#8217;s insult violates covenant ethics (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Still, <a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a> calls believers to &#8220;overcome evil with good.&#8221; Abigail will soon remind David of that very principle, averting bloodshed and guarding his conscience (<a href="/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21</a> records the tension between righteous conduct and unrighteous response. David&#8217;s frustrated declaration reveals how easily wounded pride can eclipse faith. Yet the narrative that follows proves God notices every unreturned kindness and can stop us from rash retaliation. The verse beckons us to keep doing good, entrusting the outcome to the Lord who sees, judges, and repays justly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Now David had said.</span>--This verse and the following (22nd) must be understood as a kind of parenthesis in the narrative. They express what David felt, and, as it were, his justification in his own mind for the violent and vengeful act he was about to carry out. The argument was, Nabal had returned indeed evil for good. For a long time David's band had guarded faithfully his vast scattered flocks, and had preserved them safely, and now, when he asked a small favour in return, the churl repaid him by throwing in his teeth the taunt that he was a rebel and a runaway slave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - David justifies his fierce anger by referring to the services he had rendered Nabal, and which had been requited so shabbily.
