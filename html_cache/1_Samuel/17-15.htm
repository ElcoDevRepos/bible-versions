He served King Saul as a musician to soothe the king's troubled spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a>) and also fulfilled his responsibilities at home. This movement between Saul's court and his father's house highlights David's humility and obedience, as he balanced royal service with familial duties. It also foreshadows his future as a leader who would bridge the gap between the divine and the mundane. The phrase "went back and forth" suggests a period of transition and preparation for David, who would later become Israel's greatest king.<p><b>to tend his father&#8217;s sheep</b><br>David's role as a shepherd is significant both historically and theologically. Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Israel, requiring vigilance, courage, and care&#8212;qualities that would later define David's kingship. This experience provided David with the skills necessary for leadership and protection of his people. Biblically, shepherding is a metaphor for leadership (Psalm 23; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), and David's care for his father's sheep prefigures his role as the shepherd of Israel. It also typifies Christ, the Good Shepherd, who tends to His flock with love and sacrifice.<p><b>in Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the "House of Bread," is a small town with significant biblical history. It is the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). This location ties David to the Messianic prophecy, as the Messiah was foretold to come from David's line and be born in Bethlehem. The town's humble nature contrasts with the greatness of those it produced, emphasizing God's pattern of using the lowly and unexpected to fulfill His purposes. Bethlehem's mention here roots David's story in a specific geographical and theological context, underscoring the divine orchestration of events leading to the coming of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

While the army is stalled before Goliath, God highlights the young shepherd He has already anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>).<p>&#8211; Earlier, &#8220;David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-14.htm">1 Samuel 17:14</a>), yet God&#8217;s narrative shifts to the one the world overlooks (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p>&#8211; This contrast reminds us that divine selection, not human status, drives the story, just as God later chooses &#8220;the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (1 <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went back and forth</b><p>&#8211; David &#8220;went back and forth,&#8221; shuttling between two assignments. He was already serving Saul as musician and armor-bearer (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a>), yet he did not abandon home duties.<p>&#8211; His willingness to juggle tasks reveals:<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small things before God entrusts larger ones (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; A servant heart that does not cling to prestige but meets the ordinary needs of life (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8211; Such rhythm of movement trains David for the constant demands of future kingship (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Saul</b><p>&#8211; The phrase anchors David&#8217;s service to the very king whose throne he will someday inherit.

The verse shows a young man who, though anointed, patiently alternates between royal service and humble shepherding. He respects Saul, honors his father, and proves faithful in both court and pasture. In Bethlehem&#8217;s fields God quietly shapes the shepherd-king, foreshadowing the Shepherd-King yet to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep.</span>--This short statement was, no doubt, introduced by the compiler of the First Book of Samuel to show that, in spite of this apparent introduction of David into the history for the first time in this chapter (see <a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm" title="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.">1Samuel 17:12</a> and following verses), and the inquiry of King Saul from Abner respecting the young hero's father (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-55.htm" title="And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55-58</a>), he, the compiler, was perfectly aware that David had already visited the court of Saul in the capacity of a musician (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-18.htm" title="Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.">1Samuel 16:18-23</a>). As has been already suggested, these historical books of the Old Testament are, no doubt, made up from contemporaneous documents, stored up most probably in one or other of the prophetic schools. It is, therefore, to be expected that certain facts will be found occasionally repeated. The circumstances connected with the healing influence of the music of David in the case of the <span class= "ital">soul malady </span>of King Saul were of course preserved with great care and detail in these "schools," where music and poetry were so highly cultivated and esteemed. We have here many of the very words of the original narrative preserved to us. Similarly the story of the first exploit of David is incorporated in the history probably unchanged. Each of these ancient and favourite "memories" of David, as being complete in themselves, would of course contain some of the same details.<p>The apparent ignorance of Saul and Abner respecting the young shepherd's family will be discussed in the note on <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-55.htm" title="And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55-58</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went and returned from Saul.</span> This is a very important statement, as it shows that the writer, in spite of what is said in vers. 55-58, knew that David had visited Saul at his court, and become personally known to him. Apparently it had been but a short visit, possibly because after the fit of melancholy had passed away there was no return of it for the present; and if David had been back at Bethlehem for two or three years, a young man changes so much in appearance at David's time of life that it is no wonder that neither Saul nor Abner recognised him in his shepherd's dress. For some reason, then, or other David had not remained with Saul at Gibeah, but had resumed his pastoral life at Bethlehem, and the statements made in <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> belong to the time immediately after the combat with Goliath, and not before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
