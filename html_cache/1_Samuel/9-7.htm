This practice was common in ancient Israel, where prophets served as intermediaries between God and the people. Saul's deference to the prophet shows respect for spiritual authority, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;what can we give the man?&#8221;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was customary to bring a gift when visiting a prophet or a person of high status. This gesture was not merely a formality but a sign of respect and acknowledgment of the prophet's role. The concept of offering gifts to those in spiritual authority is seen in other biblical narratives, such as when the Queen of Sheba brought gifts to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>).<p><b>For the bread in our packs is gone,</b><br>This phrase highlights the practical concern of provision during travel, reflecting the agrarian lifestyle of the time. Bread was a staple food, and its absence signifies a lack of resources. This scarcity underscores the urgency and humility in Saul's approach to the prophet, as they have nothing substantial to offer.<p><b>and there is no gift to take to the man of God.</b><br>The term "man of God" is a respectful title for a prophet, emphasizing his role as a divine messenger. The absence of a gift could be seen as a potential barrier to receiving the prophet's favor or insight. This reflects the cultural expectation of reciprocity and honor in interactions with spiritual leaders.<p><b>What do we have?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's question reveals a moment of introspection and resourcefulness. It suggests a willingness to offer whatever they possess, no matter how small, to honor the prophet. This attitude of giving from what one has, regardless of the amount, is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus commends the widow who gave two small coins (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who would later become the first king of Israel.
