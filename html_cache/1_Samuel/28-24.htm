The presence of a fattened calf indicates the woman was prepared for hospitality, a valued cultural practice. This setting is significant as it contrasts with the dire situation Saul finds himself in, seeking guidance from a medium. The calf symbolizes abundance and provision, which Saul lacks spiritually.<p><b>and she quickly slaughtered it</b><br>The act of quickly slaughtering the calf demonstrates urgency and respect for Saul, despite the circumstances. In biblical times, slaughtering an animal was a labor-intensive process, indicating the woman's willingness to serve. This action reflects the cultural importance of hospitality and the seriousness of Saul's visit. It also highlights the contrast between the woman's physical provision and Saul's spiritual desperation.<p><b>She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread was a staple in ancient Israel, often associated with haste and necessity, as seen in the Passover narrative (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>). The use of unleavened bread here may symbolize the urgency of the situation and the simplicity of the meal, reflecting the somber context of Saul's visit to the medium. This act of preparing bread connects to the broader biblical theme of bread as sustenance and provision, seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and later in the New Testament as a type of Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Medium of Endor)</a></b><br>A medium living in Endor who Saul visits to summon the spirit of Samuel.

The narrative underscores that truth: while the woman&#8217;s vocation is sinful, her act of care is genuine and recorded without embellishment.<p>&#8226; The calf&#8217;s presence emphasizes how far Saul has fallen; once the king who &#8220;took no food all day and all night&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-20.htm">1 Samuel 28:20</a>), he now relies on a forbidden medium for sustenance and counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she quickly slaughtered it</b><p>&#8226; Speed communicates urgency. Saul is exhausted (v. 20) and night is approaching; the woman responds at once, mirroring Abraham&#8217;s swift service to the three visitors (<a href="/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Generosity costs something. Slaughtering a fattened calf meant sacrificing a prime source of income or celebration (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). Her action illustrates <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do not withhold good from the one to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word repeatedly shows that tangible acts of service often precede moments of spiritual significance (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34&#8211;35</a>; <a href="/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33&#8211;34</a>). Here, a meal frames Saul&#8217;s final encounter with Samuel&#8217;s prophecy of judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She also took flour, kneaded it</b><p>&#8226; Flour represents daily provision (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12&#8211;16</a>). The woman shifts from an expensive meat dish to simple bread, reflecting both abundance and humility.<p>&#8226; Kneading requires personal effort. As Gideon &#8220;prepared a young goat and unleavened bread&#8221; for the Angel of the LORD (<a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>), so this woman personally serves, not delegating the work.<p>&#8226; Even in the middle of spiritual darkness, ordinary tasks like kneading dough become vessels for God&#8217;s unfolding plan (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and baked unleavened bread</b><p>&#8226; Unleavened bread bakes quickly; time is scarce and Saul must eat before returning to battle. The choice fits the moment, just as Israel&#8217;s haste required unleavened bread at the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8, 39</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaven often pictures corruption (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7&#8211;8</a>). The narrative subtly contrasts the bread&#8217;s purity with Saul&#8217;s compromised heart.<p>&#8226; The meal recalls earlier covenant meals in Scripture&#8212;places where God confirmed His word (<a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9&#8211;11</a>). Here, however, the bread accompanies a pronouncement of judgment rather than blessing, reminding us that God&#8217;s word stands whether it promises life or warns of death (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-24.htm">1 Samuel 28:24</a> captures a simple yet profound scene: a woman&#8212;herself living in spiritual error&#8212;provides an urgent, costly meal for a king who has drifted far from God. Every detail, from the reserved fattened calf to the hastily baked unleavened bread, highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty in arranging provision, exposes Saul&#8217;s spiritual bankruptcy, and illustrates how ordinary acts of hospitality can serve God&#8217;s larger purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Unleavened bread.</span>--There was no time to be lost;
