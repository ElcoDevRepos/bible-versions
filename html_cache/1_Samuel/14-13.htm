The act of climbing on hands and feet suggests a steep and challenging ascent, indicating the difficult terrain of the Michmash pass. This physical exertion reflects Jonathan's faith and courage, as he trusts in God's deliverance despite the odds. The imagery of climbing can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual perseverance, reminiscent of the believer's journey of faith.<p><b>with his armor-bearer behind him</b><br>The armor-bearer represents loyalty and support, crucial for Jonathan's mission. In ancient warfare, an armor-bearer was not just a servant but a trusted companion, often sharing in the dangers of battle. This relationship mirrors the biblical theme of discipleship and partnership in ministry, as seen in the relationship between Jesus and His disciples. The armor-bearer's role underscores the importance of unity and cooperation in achieving God's purposes.<p><b>And the Philistines fell before Jonathan</b><br>This phrase signifies the victory granted by God. The Philistines, Israel's persistent enemies, symbolize opposition to God's people. Jonathan's triumph is a testament to divine intervention, as his small force overcomes a larger enemy. This victory prefigures the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ, who conquers sin and death. The fall of the Philistines also echoes the theme of God's deliverance throughout Scripture, as seen in the Exodus and other battles where God fights for Israel.<p><b>and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off</b><br>The armor-bearer's actions demonstrate the completion of God's deliverance through human agency. While Jonathan initiates the attack, the armor-bearer ensures its success, highlighting the cooperative effort in fulfilling God's will. This reflects the biblical principle that while God provides the victory, He often works through human instruments. The phrase also emphasizes the thoroughness of God's deliverance, as the enemy is completely vanquished, foreshadowing the total victory of Christ over all spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

The picture is of deliberate, strenuous effort rather than a grand charge&#8212;Jonathan is willing to humble himself physically to reach the enemy&#8217;s post.<p>&#8226; His faith precedes the climb (14:6): he has already declared that &#8220;nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.&#8221; The ascent simply puts that faith into motion (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Gideon&#8217;s tiny band (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>), Jonathan acts on the conviction that God delights to work through unlikely means, so that He alone receives the glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Companionship in battle</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;with his armor-bearer behind him.&#8221; Jonathan is not a lone hero; he invites another to share the risk and the reward (14:7).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently highlights the strength found in godly partnership&#8212;&#8220;Two are better than one&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>); Paul valued Timothy as a like-minded co-worker (<a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The armor-bearer&#8217;s quiet loyalty mirrors the church&#8217;s call to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God-given victory</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And the Philistines fell before Jonathan.&#8221; The text places no emphasis on Jonathan&#8217;s skill; the enemy &#8220;fell&#8221; as soon as contact is made. Earlier the Philistines had taunted, but Jonathan heard in their words a sign that &#8220;the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel&#8221; (14:12).<p>&#8226; Moments later &#8220;panic struck the camp, the field, and all the people&#8221; (14:15)&#8212;evidence of divine intervention reminiscent of the routs in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-12.htm">2 Chronicles 14:12</a> and <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>.<p>&#8226; The victory underscores <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s saving power, not numerical advantage, determines the outcome (<a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Completing the work</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off.&#8221; Jonathan initiates; the armor-bearer secures the result.

There were probably but few sentinels at their posts; the inaccessibility of the craggy fortress had lulled the garrison into security. The few watching him at first mocked, and then, as Jonathan advanced with strange rapidity, they seem to have been, as it were, paralysed--the feat was hardly human--as the man, all armed, sprang over the rocky parapet. "His chief weapon was his bow," writes Dean Stanley; "his whole tribe was a tribe of archers, and he was the chief archer of them all." Arrived at the summit, in rapid succession he shot his deadly bolts, his gallant armour-bearer following his chief's example. and twenty men, so says the record, fell before they had recovered their surprise. In a moment a panic seized the garrison, and a hurried flight ensued, for they felt they had to deal with no mortal strength.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon his hands and upon his feet.</span> Of course a single stone rolled down upon them while thus clambering up the precipitous side of the cliff would have sent them to the bottom; but the Philistines, apparently considering the ascent impossible, seem entirely to have neglected them. The youthful appearance of the two no doubt contributed to throw them off their guard. <span class="cmt_word">And they fell before Jonathan.</span> The brevity of the Hebrew very well expresses the rapidity of Jonathan's action. Used to mountaineering, he was ready, as soon as he had reached the summit, to commence the attack, and the Philistines, little expecting so vigorous an onslaught from so feeble a force, were surprised, and made but a slight resistance. The armour bearer also behaved with a bravery like his master's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3129.htm">Strong's 3129: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">climbed up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
