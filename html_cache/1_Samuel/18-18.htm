This offer is not just a personal matter but a political one, as marriage into the royal family would elevate David's status significantly. David's humility is evident here, reflecting his character as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This humility contrasts with Saul's growing pride and insecurity.<p><b>Who am I</b><br>David's rhetorical question underscores his humility and self-awareness. Despite his recent victory over Goliath and rising popularity, David does not see himself as worthy of such an honor. This humility is a recurring theme in David's life and is reminiscent of Moses' response to God's call in <a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>. It also foreshadows the humility of Christ, who, despite His divine nature, took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>).<p><b>and what is my family</b><br>David's family, the house of Jesse, was not of significant social standing in Israel. They were from Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, which was not considered a place of prominence. This acknowledgment of his family's humble status highlights the biblical theme that God often chooses the lowly and unexpected to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>.<p><b>or my father&#8217;s clan in Israel</b><br>The mention of his father's clan emphasizes the modesty of David's background. Jesse's family was not part of the ruling elite or priestly class. This humility is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for God's sovereign choice of David as king, demonstrating that God's criteria for leadership differ from human expectations (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>that I should become the son-in-law of the king?</b><br>Becoming the king's son-in-law would have been a significant honor and responsibility. In ancient Israel, marriage alliances were often used to secure political power and stability. David's question reflects his awareness of the gravity of such a position. This moment foreshadows the greater covenant relationship between God and His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is both the Son of David and the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who was anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel. At this point, he is serving in King Saul's court and has gained favor due to his victory over Goliath and his military successes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who has become increasingly jealous and fearful of David's rising popularity and God's favor upon him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_family.htm">David's Family</a></b><br>David refers to his humble origins, coming from the tribe of Judah and the family of Jesse, a modest lineage without royal connections.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of twelve tribes.

Despite his accomplishments, he does not presume to be worthy of royal status. This teaches us to remain humble, recognizing that any elevation in life is by God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity.htm">Understanding Our Identity</a></b><br>David's question reflects an understanding of his identity in God rather than in societal status. We should find our worth and identity in God's view of us, not in worldly achievements or connections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_promotion.htm">God's Sovereignty in Promotion</a></b><br>David's life illustrates that God is the one who elevates and positions us according to His purpose. We should trust in God's timing and plan for our lives, rather than striving for positions through our own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_god's_favor.htm">Gratitude for God's Favor</a></b><br>Recognizing our humble beginnings and God's favor should lead us to gratitude.

By highlighting personal and familial insignificance, he magnifies the LORD&#8217;s grace that elevates the lowly. The verse invites readers to trust that God literally fulfills His purposes, exalting whomever He chooses, while calling His servants to walk in humble awe when unexpected honor appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">What is my life?</span>--These words in David's modest and wise answer have been variously interpreted.

(b) As referring to the condition of life in which he was born and to which he was accustomed; so Keil; but it is doubtful if the Hebrew word here used ever has this significance.
