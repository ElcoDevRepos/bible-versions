It reflects the biblical theme of God's perfect timing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. The phrase suggests a period of waiting and faith, common in biblical narratives where God's promises are fulfilled after a period of testing or patience.<p><b>Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son</b><br>Hannah's conception is a direct answer to her prayer, highlighting the power of prayer and God's intervention in human affairs. This event is significant in the biblical narrative as it marks the beginning of Samuel's life, who would become a pivotal figure in Israel's history. The miraculous nature of this conception is reminiscent of other biblical births, such as Isaac's birth to Sarah and John the Baptist's birth to Elizabeth, both of whom were also born to previously barren women.<p><b>She named him Samuel</b><br>The name Samuel is significant and is often understood to mean "heard by God" or "asked of God." Naming in the Bible often reflects circumstances of birth or prophetic significance. Samuel's name serves as a perpetual reminder of God's faithfulness in answering prayer. This practice of naming children with meaningful names is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the naming of Isaac, which means "laughter," reflecting Sarah's reaction to the promise of his birth.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Because I have asked for him from the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Hannah's statement underscores the personal relationship between her and God, emphasizing the power of prayer and God's responsiveness. It reflects the biblical principle that God hears and answers the prayers of the faithful, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>. This phrase also highlights the importance of acknowledging God's role in the blessings received, a theme that runs throughout the scriptures, encouraging believers to give thanks and recognize God's hand in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was initially barren.

Waiting tempered her faith, purified her motives, and prepared her to steward the blessing.<p>&#8226; The phrase quietly underscores divine sovereignty: what looks like ordinary passing days is, in fact, God orchestrating events behind the scenes (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son</b><p>&#8226; The conception itself is a testimony to the Lord&#8217;s direct intervention: &#8220;the LORD had closed her womb&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5</a>), and now He opened it. Only He holds that key (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>; <a href="/luke/1-24.htm">Luke 1:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Every child is a deliberate gift, not an accident of biology (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). Life in the womb comes from God&#8217;s hand, affirming its sacred value from the earliest moment (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance follows dependence. Hannah&#8217;s earlier tears at Shiloh (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10-13</a>) are answered in the cry of a newborn&#8212;proof that heartfelt prayer moves heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She named him Samuel</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture, names often preach sermons. By choosing &#8220;Samuel,&#8221; Hannah tied her son&#8217;s identity to God&#8217;s faithfulness, much like Sarah naming Isaac &#8220;laughter&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>) or Elizabeth naming John (<a href="/luke/1-60.htm">Luke 1:60</a>).<p>&#8226; The name would remind Samuel every day that he was the product of prayer and promise. It also testified to everyone who met him that the Lord listens.<p>&#8226; Parents today can follow Hannah&#8217;s example by intentionally pointing their children&#8212;and onlookers&#8212;back to the Lord&#8217;s work in their family stories (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because I have asked for him from the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Hannah&#8217;s explanation echoes <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>, &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me.&#8221; It celebrates a personal God who invites, hears, and responds (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Her words close the loop on her earlier vow (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). What she asked for in private, she now proclaims in public. Worship follows answered prayer.<p>&#8226; Notice the focus: the blessing is acknowledged as coming &#8220;from the LORD,&#8221; not from luck, doctors, or chance (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Gratitude flows upward to its proper source.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hannah&#8217;s journey teaches that God&#8217;s timing is perfect, His power can open any closed door, His gifts demand grateful acknowledgment, and His answers are best commemorated by lives openly dedicated to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And called his name Samuel</span>.--The words translated "because I have asked him of the Lord," do not explain the meaning of the name "Samuel&#250;" they simply give the reason for his mother so calling him.
