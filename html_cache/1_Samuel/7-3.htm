This moment follows a period of Philistine oppression and spiritual decline. Samuel's leadership marks a transition from the era of judges to the establishment of monarchy in Israel. His authority is recognized by all tribes, indicating a unified call to repentance.<p><b>If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts</b><br>The call to return to the LORD signifies repentance and a wholehearted commitment. The heart, in Hebrew thought, represents the center of will and emotion. This phrase underscores the necessity of sincere devotion, not merely external compliance. It echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>then put away the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you</b><br>Foreign gods refer to the idols and deities of surrounding nations, which Israel had adopted, violating the first commandment. Ashtoreths were Canaanite fertility goddesses, often associated with Baal worship. This call to remove idols is a recurring theme in Israel's history, highlighting the struggle against syncretism. It parallels Joshua's challenge in <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a> to serve the LORD exclusively.<p><b>prepare your hearts for the LORD</b><br>Preparation of the heart involves internal purification and readiness to serve God. This concept is akin to the New Testament call for believers to be sanctified and set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). It implies an intentional turning away from sin and a dedication to holiness.<p><b>and serve Him only</b><br>Exclusive service to the LORD is a foundational principle of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This command reflects the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, affirming monotheism and loyalty to God alone. It prefigures Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>, where He emphasizes worship and service to God only.<p><b>And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>The promise of deliverance is contingent upon Israel's repentance and faithfulness. The Philistines were a persistent threat, representing the consequences of Israel's disobedience. God's deliverance is a recurring theme, demonstrating His faithfulness and power. This deliverance foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel played a crucial role in guiding the Israelites back to God.

This plural form of Baal refers to the numerous images of Baal which existed, as does the plural form Ashtaroth to those of the female goddess Astarte. They were both favourite Ph?nician deities, known under the familiar names of Baal, Bil, Bel, and Ashtaroth, Astarte, Istar. They represented the productive power of nature, and were generally worshipped throughout the East, usually with a wild and wanton worship.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare your hearts.</span>--It was, indeed, a desperate venture seemingly, this, to which the prophet summoned unarmed and undisciplined Israel. They were then completely at the mercy of their long victorious foes, who held the chief fortified places in the country with their garrisons; and Samuel challenged Israel to bid defiance to the most cherished institutions of their oppressors, bade them, if they loved the Eternal, to turn aside from reverencing what Philistia held to be sacred and all-powerful. He knew well that what he urged upon the people would at once provoke what appeared to be a dangerous and most unequal contest. If defeated, then Israel would bring upon their devoted heads utter misery, and a ruin hitherto undreamed of even in their unhappy land. Had they courage and faith to plunge unarmed, undisciplined, into so perilous a contest? For twenty years the great patriot-statesman had laboured for this end. He had succeeded at last in opening the eyes of Israel to see the real cause of their misfortunes. He had made them as a nation hunger for the lost presence of the Eternal, who had loved them in past days with so great a love; and now, after twenty long slow years, was his work done at last? They sorrowed indeed for their national sins; but had they faith and courage, all unarmed as they were, to rise against the powerful enemies of purity and God?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye do return,</span> etc. At length everything was ripe for a change, and the reformation wrought privately in their hearts was followed by public action. Samuel's secret addresses had no doubt been watched with anger by the Philistines, but he now ventures upon open resistance; for this public summons to Israel to put away its idols by a national act was a summons also to an uprise against foreign domination. We must suppose that the people had often assured Samuel in his wanderings of the reality of their repentance, and of their readiness to stake everything upon the issue of war. As a statesman, he now judges that the time has come, and convenes a national assembly. But everything would depend upon their earnestness. They were virtually unarmed; they would have to deal with an enemy long victorious, and who held the most important posts in their country with garrisons. Terrible suffering would follow upon defeat. Was their faith strong enough, their courage desperate enough, for so fearful a risk? Especially as Samuel is never described to us as a warrior or military hero. He could inspire no confidence as a general. He himself makes everything depend upon theft faith, and all he can promise is, "I will pray for you unto Jehovah" (ver. 5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
