Saul's reign was marked by increasing paranoia and a desire to maintain power, leading him to rely on intelligence about David's movements. This reflects the broader theme of Saul's decline and the erosion of trust within his kingdom.<p><b>that David was at Naioth</b><br>Naioth is a location associated with the prophet Samuel, suggesting a place of spiritual refuge and prophetic activity. David's presence here indicates his seeking of protection and guidance from Samuel, a significant spiritual leader in Israel. This setting underscores the contrast between Saul's earthly kingship and the divine anointing and protection over David.<p><b>in Ramah</b><br>Ramah is Samuel's hometown and a significant location in his ministry. It serves as a center for prophetic activity and a place where God's presence is sought. The mention of Ramah connects this narrative to earlier events in Samuel's life and ministry, highlighting the continuity of God's work through His prophets. Ramah's geographical location in the tribal territory of Benjamin also emphasizes the tension between Saul's pursuit and David's refuge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel.

Samuel had his own house in Ramah, and these dwellings, where his prophetic schools were established, were in the immediate neighbourhood, "Naioth in Ramah." It was to this school he took David on this occasion. The Chaldee Targum renders or paraphrases Naioth here by "house of learning."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - On hearing where David was, Saul sends messengers to arrest him, and we thus incidentally gain a most interesting account of the inner condition of Samuel's schools. Evidently after Saul had become king Samuel devoted his main energies to this noble effort to raise Israel from the barbarous depths into which it had sunk; and when the messengers arrive they enter some hall, where they find a regularly organised choir, consisting not of "sons of the prophets," young men still under training, but <span class="cmt_word">of prophets,</span> men who had finished their preparatory studies, and arrived at a higher elevation. The Chaldee Paraphrast calls them <span class="accented">scribes</span>; and doubtless those educated in Samuel's schools held an analogous position to that of the scribes in later days. And <span class="cmt_word">Samuel</span> himself was <span class="cmt_word">standing</span> - not <span class="cmt_word">as appointed over them</span>; he was the founder and originator of these schools, and all authority was derived from him. What the Hebrew says is that he was "standing as chief over them," and they, frill of Divine enthusiasm, were chanting psalms to God's glory. So noble was the sight, that Saul's messengers on entering were seized with a like enthusiasm, and, laying aside their murderous purpose, joined in the hearty service of the prophetic sanctuary. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">they saw</span> the Hebrew has "he saw," but as all the versions have the plural, it is probably a mere mistake. The Hebrew word for <span class="cmt_word">company</span> is found only here. By transposing the letters we have the ordinary word for <span class="accented">congregation</span>, but possibly it was their own technical name for some peculiar arrangement of the choir. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When it was reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hofal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was at Naioth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5121.htm">Strong's 5121: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naioth -- an abode of prophets</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in Ramah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7414.htm">Strong's 7414: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ramah -- 'height', the name of several places in Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_samuel/19-19.htm">1 Samuel 19:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_samuel/19-19.htm">OT History: 1 Samuel 19:19 It was told Saul saying Behold David (1Sa iSam 1 Sam i sa) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_samuel/19-18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Samuel 19:18"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 19:18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Samuel 19:20"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 19:20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
