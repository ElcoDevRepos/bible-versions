It played a significant role in the history of the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark had been captured by the Philistines and caused them great trouble, leading them to return it to Israel. The men of Kiriath-jearim were chosen to retrieve the Ark, indicating their trustworthiness and reverence for the sacred object. This event marks a transition from the Ark's time among the Philistines back to Israelite care, symbolizing a restoration of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and took it into Abinadab&#8217;s house on the hill.</b><br>Abinadab's house was chosen as a temporary resting place for the Ark, suggesting that his family was respected and possibly of priestly lineage. The location "on the hill" implies a place of prominence and visibility, which is fitting for the Ark, representing God's throne on earth. This setting also foreshadows the eventual establishment of the Ark in Jerusalem, another city on a hill. The choice of Abinadab's house highlights the importance of proper stewardship and reverence for holy objects.<p><b>And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD.</b><br>Consecration involved setting someone apart for a holy purpose, often accompanied by rituals such as anointing. Eleazar's consecration signifies the seriousness of his duty to guard the Ark, ensuring it was treated with the utmost respect and care. This act reflects the broader biblical theme of God appointing individuals for specific roles in His divine plan. Eleazar's role as guardian can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate guardian and mediator of God's presence with humanity. The consecration also underscores the need for holiness and dedication in service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-jearim.htm">Kiriath-jearim</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Judah where the Ark of the Covenant was brought after being returned by the Philistines.

Their reverent choices opened the door for Israel&#8217;s repentance and renewal under Samuel, reminding us that God entrusts His presence to those who approach Him with humble, prepared hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The ark of the Lord.</span>--Kirjath-jearim, the home of the Ark for nearly fifty years, was probably selected as the resting-place of the sacred emblem as being the nearest large city to Beth-shemesh then in the hands of the Israelites. It was neither a priestly nor a Levitical city, but it no doubt had preserved something of its ancient character of sanctity even among the children of Israel. In old days before the Hebrew invasion, it was a notable "high place," and a seat of worship of Baal. This was also, no doubt, taken into account when it was resolved to locate the Ark there. The words "in the hill" remind us that the old "high place" was still marked, and was from its sacred associations looked on as a fitting temporary resting-place for the sacred treasure of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Eleazar</span>--It is most likely that this Abinadab was a Levite. The names Eleazar and Uzzah, and Ahio of the same family (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm" title="And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.">2Samuel 6:3</a>), are Levitical appellations. Samuel--who, though he is not named in this transaction, was, no doubt, the director--would, of course, have endeavoured to find a man of the tribe of Levi for the sacred trust. "This Eleazar was constituted not priest, but watchman at the grave of the Ark by its corpse, till the future joyful resurrection."--<span class= "ital">Hengstenberg, </span>quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange. </span>Here the Ark remained until King David brought it from "the house on the hill," in the city of woods, first to the home of Obed-edom, and then to his own royal Zion.

If, however, the translation <span class="accented">in the hill</span> be preferred, we may suppose that it was because lofty heights were still considered fit places for Jehovah's worship, or there may even have been a "high place" there, of which Abinadab was the keeper. What exactly were the duties of Eleazar we cannot tell, as the word <span class="accented">to keep</span> is very indefinite; but probably, after the fearful ruin at Shiloh, all regular services and sacrifices were in abeyance until the return of happier times. Even here it was the men of the city who sanctified Eleazar, and not a priest.
