The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles for control of the land. Goliath's challenge was not just a personal taunt but a representation of the Philistine's defiance against Israel and their God. His words were intended to instill fear and assert dominance, reflecting the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines, which is a recurring theme in the books of Samuel.<p><b>Saul and all the Israelites</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, was chosen to lead and protect the nation. His reaction to Goliath's challenge is crucial, as it highlights his spiritual and leadership shortcomings. The Israelites, under Saul's leadership, were expected to trust in God's power and deliverance. However, their fear indicates a lack of faith and reliance on God, contrasting with earlier victories where faith played a central role. This moment sets the stage for David's introduction as a man after God's own heart, who would later become king.<p><b>Were dismayed and greatly afraid</b><br>The fear and dismay of Saul and the Israelites underscore the psychological warfare employed by Goliath. This reaction is significant because it shows a departure from the faith and courage that should characterize God's people. The Israelites' fear contrasts with the courage of David, who later confronts Goliath with confidence in God's deliverance. This fear also reflects the spiritual state of Israel under Saul's leadership, where reliance on human strength overshadowed trust in divine intervention. This moment foreshadows the need for a new kind of leadership, one that David would eventually provide, pointing to the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who conquers fear and embodies perfect faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

Similar scenes appear in <a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31&#8211;33</a>, where a discouraging report melted the hearts of the people.<p>&#8226; Scripture stresses the power of what is spoken&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a> reminds us that &#8220;death and life are in the power of the tongue.&#8221; Here, death-dealing words momentarily prevail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Philistine</b><p>Identifying the speaker matters. Goliath is repeatedly called &#8220;the Philistine,&#8221; underscoring that he belongs to a covenant-breaking people (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>, Philistines epitomize opposition to the living God.<p>&#8226; The taunt is not just military&#8212;it is theological. <a href="/psalms/74-18.htm">Psalm 74:18</a> describes enemies who &#8220;mock the name of the Lord,&#8221; the very offense Goliath commits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul and all the Israelites</b><p>Both king and people react alike, revealing a leadership vacuum.<p>&#8226; Saul once inspired Israel to follow him (<a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6&#8211;7</a>), but after losing the Lord&#8217;s favor (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>), he cannot inspire courage.<p>&#8226; The people mirror their leader&#8217;s fear, recalling <a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a> where they &#8220;hid in caves&#8221; when outmatched.<p>&#8226; Contrast this with Joshua&#8217;s leadership in <a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10&#8211;11</a>, where he stirs the nation to bold obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were dismayed and greatly afraid</b><p>Dismay indicates a collapse of confidence; great fear shows the depth of their distress.<p>&#8226; Fear often surfaces when past victories are forgotten (<a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already promised His presence against such foes&#8212;<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a> says, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230;for the Lord your God is with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David will later counter fear with faith, declaring in <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, &#8220;The Lord is my light and my salvation&#8212;whom shall I fear?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The New Testament parallels this principle: &#8220;God has not given us a spirit of fear&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a> records the immediate impact of Goliath&#8217;s blasphemous challenge: it exposes Saul&#8217;s faltering leadership and Israel&#8217;s fragile faith. Hearing hostile words from an uncircumcised Philistine should have driven the nation to recall God&#8217;s covenant promises, yet they respond with crippling fear. The verse sets the stage for David&#8217;s entrance, highlighting the sharp contrast between fear rooted in human strength and confidence anchored in the Lord&#8217;s unchanging faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">They were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span>--Saul the king, perhaps, was restrained from personally accepting the challenge by motives of dignity, but the marked silence on his part, and the utter hopelessness of his army, reads in strange contrast to the former records of Hebrew daring. Where was Jonathan, for instance, ever the bravest of the brave, and his gallant armour-bearer? There had assuredly been a time when neither motives of dignity nor prudence would have restrained Saul and his warriors from accepting the challenge of the uncircumcised enemy. We notice, too, here there is no inquiry of the Urim and Thummim, no mention of prayer to the God of the armies of Israel. An evil spirit was indeed upon the King of Israel.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On hearing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
