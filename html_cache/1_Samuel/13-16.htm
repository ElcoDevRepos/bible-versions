Our translators no doubt considered that as <span class="accented">Gibeah of Benjamin</span> occurs in the previous verse, this must be the same place. But our greater knowledge of the geography of the Holy Land enables us to say that Geba is right; for, as we have seen, it was at one end of the defile, at the other end of which was Michmash; and here alone could the small army of Saul have any chance of defending itself against the vast host of the Philistines. However much we may blame Saul's disobedience, he was a skilful soldier and a brave man, and his going with his little band to the end of the pass to make a last desperate stand was an act worthy of a king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
