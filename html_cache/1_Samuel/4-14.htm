The outcry he heard was likely from the people of Shiloh, reacting to the devastating news of the Ark of the Covenant being captured by the Philistines. This event marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as the Ark symbolized God's presence and favor. The outcry reflects the collective despair and fear of the Israelites, who understood the spiritual and national implications of losing the Ark.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Why this commotion?&#8221;</b><br>Eli's question indicates his lack of awareness of the battle's outcome and the gravity of the situation. His position as high priest would typically place him at the center of communication, yet his physical limitations and the chaos surrounding the event left him uninformed. The commotion suggests a scene of panic and confusion, highlighting the Israelites' dependence on the Ark for security and their fear of divine abandonment. This moment foreshadows the transition of leadership from Eli to Samuel, as Eli's inability to perceive the situation contrasts with Samuel's emerging role as a prophet.<p><b>So the man hurried over</b><br>The man referred to here is a Benjamite who had fled from the battlefield to bring news to Shiloh. His urgency underscores the critical nature of the message he carried. The act of hurrying indicates the importance of delivering the news swiftly, as the capture of the Ark was not just a military defeat but a spiritual crisis for Israel. This urgency reflects the broader biblical theme of messengers bearing significant news, paralleling other instances where swift communication was vital, such as the resurrection of Christ.<p><b>and reported to Eli.</b><br>The report to Eli signifies the transfer of crucial information to the spiritual leader of Israel. Eli's role as high priest made him the primary recipient of such news, despite his physical frailties. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to Eli's death upon hearing the full extent of the disaster, marking the end of his leadership and the beginning of a new era under Samuel. The report also serves as a narrative device to highlight the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the fulfillment of God's judgment against Eli's house, as previously prophesied.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, Eli was an elderly leader who had judged Israel for 40 years.

Similar national lament erupts when the Ark enters battle earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>) and when judgment falls on Jerusalem centuries later (<a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents this sound as a literal, audible sign of covenant judgment, echoing earlier scenes of alarm such as the shout at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>) and the cry at Ai after defeat (<a href="/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked, &#8220;Why this commotion?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s question shows both concern and confusion&#8212;he hears noise but lacks sight to interpret it. This mirrors the spiritual dimness already noted in Eli&#8217;s household (<a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Hebrew word translated &#8220;commotion&#8221; also appears in Isaiah&#8217;s oracle against Babylon: &#8220;The tumult on the mountains&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>), underscoring that God&#8217;s judgment often arrives amid public uproar.<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s instinct to seek understanding reflects the biblical call to &#8220;test all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>) rather than dismissing events as chance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the man hurried over</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;man&#8221; is the Benjamite runner who fled the battlefield at Ebenezer (<a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>). His torn clothes and dust-covered head are visible tokens of mourning, paralleling Jacob&#8217;s grief symbols after Joseph&#8217;s reported death (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>).<p>&#8226; His haste underscores the urgency of bad news, a pattern seen when messengers race with word of Absalom&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19-27</a>) or when Mary Magdalene runs to tell the disciples the tomb is empty (<a href="/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By hurrying to Eli first, the messenger honors Israel&#8217;s judge and priest, fulfilling the command to respect elders (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reported to Eli.</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;reported&#8221; indicates formal testimony, like the messengers who &#8220;reported&#8221; Saul&#8217;s defeat (<a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>) or those who &#8220;reported&#8221; Jesus&#8217; works to John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/7-18.htm">Luke 7:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The message will shatter Eli: Israel&#8217;s armies are routed, his sons are dead, and the Ark is captured (<a href="/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a>). Earlier divine warnings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>; 3:11-14) now materialize, proving God&#8217;s word infallible.<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s eventual response&#8212;falling backward, breaking his neck, and dying (<a href="/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>)&#8212;illustrates <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>: &#8220;A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed&#8212;without remedy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/4-14.htm">1 Samuel 4:14</a> portrays the precise moment divine judgment reaches Eli&#8217;s ears. A literal outcry announces Israel&#8217;s defeat; a blind priest seeks clarity; a weary runner rushes in; and a faithful report seals what God had foretold. The verse teaches us that no matter one&#8217;s status or age, God&#8217;s warnings come true in real space and time, calling every listener to heed His word before the commotion of judgment arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">What meaneth the noise?</span>--The blind old man, we must suppose, was seated on his chair of state, surrounded by priests and Levites, who were in attendance on him as high priest and judge. As the runner drew near, and the torn dress and the dust sprinkled on his head--the symbols of disaster--became visible, the wail of woe would soon run through the place. The cry of sorrow was the first intimation to the blind Eli: he was soon to hear the details. His question was probably, in the first place, addressed to the little court standing by his throne. The narrative is so vivid we seem to hear the sound of the cries of grief and terror which Eli heard, and to see the scene of dismay and confusion which those sightless eyes were prevented from looking on.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Eli heard the noise of the crying,</span> he asked the meaning of <span class="cmt_word">this tumult.</span> The word signifies any confused noise, as the splashing of rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41</a>), but especially the din made by a multitude of people (<a href="/job/39-7.htm">Job 39:7</a>). It exactly expresses here the Babel of voices, all asking news at once, which at the coming of the messenger surged around the high priest's throne. He demands the reason, and the uproar is quelled, while "the man hasted, and came and told Eli." Not <span class="cmt_word">came in,</span> for Eli was without on the wayside, but simply <span class="accented">came to Eli</span>, being summoned thither by one of the Levites in attendance.
