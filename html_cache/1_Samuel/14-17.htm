This reflects his role as a military commander during a time when Israel was frequently at war with neighboring nations, particularly the Philistines. The troops with Saul were likely stationed at Gibeah, a strategic location in the tribal territory of Benjamin. Saul's leadership is often contrasted with that of his son Jonathan, who is portrayed as more faithful and courageous.<p><b>&#8220;Call the roll and see who has left us.&#8221;</b><br>The act of calling the roll indicates a military practice of accountability and organization. It was essential for leaders to know the status and number of their forces, especially during times of conflict. This practice also highlights the importance of each individual in the army, as the absence of even a few could impact the battle. Saul's concern about who has left suggests a moment of crisis or confusion, possibly due to the unexpected commotion caused by Jonathan's earlier actions against the Philistines.<p><b>And when they had called the roll</b><br>The process of calling the roll would involve a systematic check of the soldiers present, likely by name or unit. This reflects the structured nature of ancient military operations. The roll call serves as a narrative device to reveal the absence of Jonathan and his armor-bearer, setting the stage for the unfolding events. It also underscores the tension and uncertainty within Saul's camp.<p><b>they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.</b><br>Jonathan, Saul's son, is a key figure in this narrative, known for his bravery and faith in God. His absence, along with his armor-bearer, indicates that they have taken independent action, which is later revealed to be a bold attack on the Philistine garrison. This act of faith and courage contrasts with Saul's hesitance and reliance on human methods. Jonathan's relationship with his armor-bearer also highlights the close bonds and trust between warriors in ancient Israel. This absence foreshadows the significant impact of Jonathan's actions on the battle and the morale of the Israelite troops.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
