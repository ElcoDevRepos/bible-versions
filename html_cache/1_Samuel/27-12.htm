David, fleeing from King Saul, sought refuge with Achish. This trust was significant because David had previously defeated Goliath, a Philistine champion, and was known for his victories over the Philistines. Achish's trust in David highlights the complex political dynamics of the time, where alliances could shift based on mutual benefit rather than ethnic or national loyalty. This trust also foreshadows the eventual acceptance of David by other foreign leaders, as seen in his interactions with Hiram, king of Tyre, in later years.<p><b>thinking, &#8220;Since he has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel</b><br>David's actions, including his raids against Israel's enemies while pretending to attack Israelite territories, led Achish to believe that David had irreparably damaged his relationship with his own people. This phrase reflects the cultural understanding of honor and shame in the ancient Near East, where being a "stench" to one's people indicated a complete break in social and political ties. This perception by Achish was crucial for David's strategy, as it allowed him to maintain his cover and continue his operations without suspicion.<p><b>he will be my servant forever.&#8221;</b><br>Achish's belief that David would serve him indefinitely underscores the king's misjudgment of David's ultimate loyalty to Israel and God's covenant. This expectation of perpetual servitude contrasts with God's plan for David to become king of Israel. The phrase also echoes the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over human plans, as seen in Joseph's rise to power in Egypt and Daniel's influence in Babylon. David's time with Achish can be seen as a period of preparation and testing, much like the experiences of other biblical figures who served foreign rulers before fulfilling their God-given destinies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently in exile, seeking refuge among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who believes David has become a traitor to Israel and thus trusts him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people often in conflict with Israel, among whom David seeks asylum.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation from which David is temporarily estranged due to Saul's hostility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>A Philistine city where David finds refuge and gains the trust of King Achish.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_and_deception.htm">Trust and Deception</a></b><br>Achish's trust in David is based on a misunderstanding.

He interprets David&#8217;s raids on southern tribes (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8&#8211;10</a>) as attacks on Judah, believing the rift is permanent.<p>&#8226; This echoes how Saul once called David &#8220;my enemy&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-19.htm">1 Samuel 24:19</a>), though Saul himself would later weep over David (<a href="/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24&#8211;25</a>).
