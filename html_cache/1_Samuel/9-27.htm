The city referred to is likely Ramah, where Samuel resided. The "edge of the city" suggests a private setting, away from the hustle and bustle, suitable for a prophetic revelation. In biblical times, city gates and edges were often places of decision-making and significant encounters (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>).<p><b>Samuel said to Saul</b><br>Samuel, the last judge of Israel and a prophet, plays a pivotal role in transitioning Israel from a theocracy to a monarchy. His authority and spiritual insight are crucial in guiding Saul, who is about to be anointed as the first king of Israel. This interaction highlights the divine appointment and guidance that Saul is receiving through Samuel.<p><b>Tell the servant to go on ahead of us</b><br>This instruction indicates the need for privacy and confidentiality. In ancient Near Eastern culture, servants were often present, but significant matters, especially those involving divine revelation, required discretion. This separation underscores the importance of the message Samuel is about to deliver.<p><b>but you stay for a while</b><br>Samuel's request for Saul to stay signifies the importance of the forthcoming revelation. It emphasizes Saul's role in God's plan and the need for him to be attentive and receptive. This moment marks a turning point in Saul's life, as he is about to receive a divine commission.<p><b>and I will reveal to you the word of God</b><br>The "word of God" here refers to a specific prophetic message concerning Saul's future. In the Old Testament, prophets were God's mouthpieces, delivering His will and guidance (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). This revelation is crucial as it sets the stage for Saul's anointing and the establishment of the monarchy in Israel.<p><b>So the servant went on</b><br>The servant's departure ensures that the conversation between Samuel and Saul remains private. This act of obedience also reflects the cultural norms of the time, where servants followed the instructions of their masters without question. The servant's absence allows for an undistracted and focused communication of God's message to Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Joshua had a similar encounter &#8220;when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a Man standing in front of him&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God often meets His people on the road or at a boundary: Isaac &#8220;went out to meditate in the field toward evening&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>), and the risen Christ drew near to two disciples &#8220;as they talked and deliberated&#8221; on the way to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaving town marks the end of Saul&#8217;s search for lost donkeys (<a href="/1_samuel/9-3.htm">1 Samuel 9:3&#8211;20</a>) and the threshold of a new calling. The edge of the city becomes the edge of his old life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel said to Saul</b><p>&#8226; Samuel, the prophet whom &#8220;the LORD was with&#8230; and let none of his words fall to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>), now turns his full attention to Saul.<p>&#8226; God regularly chooses a faithful servant to deliver pivotal truth: Moses to Israel (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>), Nathan to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), Ananias to the other Saul of Tarsus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul must learn that true leadership begins by listening to God&#8217;s spokesman, not by relying on personal strength or pedigree (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell the servant to go on ahead of us</b><p>&#8226; Privacy signals importance. Like Abraham who told his servants, &#8220;Stay here&#8230; while I and the boy go over there to worship&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>), Samuel clears the room for holy business.<p>&#8226; Jesus practiced the same pattern, taking only Peter, James, and John up the mountain (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>) and excluding others from Jairus&#8217;s house (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction reminds us that not every word from God is for public ears; some moments are reserved for the one being called.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But you stay for a while</b><p>&#8226; Saul is singled out. Remaining behind echoes the Lord&#8217;s command to Moses and Joshua: &#8220;Present yourselves&#8230; that I may commission him&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-14.htm">Deuteronomy 31:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Waiting prepares the heart. Mary &#8220;sat at the Lord&#8217;s feet listening to His word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>); disciples were told, &#8220;Remain in Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God calls leaders to linger with Him before they lead others. Haste would abort spiritual formation; lingering invites revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will reveal to you the word of God</b><p>&#8226; Revelation is the central promise. &#8220;The LORD continued to appear&#8230; for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel by the word of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetic disclosure is God&#8217;s consistent pattern: &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For Saul, this means specific instructions (anointing, signs, kingship&#8212;<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10</a>). For us, it underscores that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word is authoritative, sufficient, and meant to be obeyed, not merely admired.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the servant went on</b><p>&#8226; The unnamed servant&#8217;s obedience clears the stage. Like Philip who &#8220;rose and went&#8221; when the angel spoke (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>), he shows quiet faithfulness.<p>&#8226; His simple compliance reminds us that every role matters in God&#8217;s plan (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>); even a servant&#8217;s steps are woven into divine purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/9-27.htm">1 Samuel 9:27</a> captures a sacred pause: leaving the city, dismissing the servant, Samuel positions Saul to hear God&#8217;s word alone. The verse teaches that genuine leadership begins in solitude with God, that revelation is given to attentive hearts, and that even the smallest acts of obedience (the servant walking on) advance God&#8217;s larger plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">That I may shew thee the word of God.</span>--The wonderment of Saul at the strange honour and distinction shown to him, a comparatively unknown Benjamite, by the famous prophet-judge, was, no doubt, increased by this proposal of Samuel to accompany him a little way on his journey homeward. The meaning of all that had happened to him on the day before was, however, now to be revealed: the gracious welcome as a distinguished guest evidently looked for, the courteous hospitality in the judge's house; and, more than all, the long private instructions Samuel had given him in the evening on the state of Israel. The prophet now directs that the servant should be sent on alone, that he might in all solemn confidence impart to Saul "the word of God," that is, all that the God of Israel had revealed to him, the seer, concerning Saul's appointment.<p>It would have been interesting to have learned something of Saul's state of mind when this startling revelation of the choice of God was first made to him.<p>The writer here is silent, but in the next chapter (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm" title="And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.">1Samuel 9:6</a>) we read that the Spirit of the Lord was specially promised to this chosen one. When new duties are imposed by God, He never forgets to bestow the gift of new powers.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were going down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wr&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3381.htm">Strong's 3381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come or go down, descend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the edge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(biq&#183;&#7779;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
