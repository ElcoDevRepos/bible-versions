This phrase indicates a moment of concession, where Samuel agrees to return with Saul. This act can be seen as a demonstration of Samuel's continued commitment to his prophetic role and his desire to maintain unity among the people of Israel. It also highlights the tension between divine command and human leadership, as Samuel had just delivered God's message of rejection to Saul. The relationship between Samuel and Saul is complex, marked by Saul's anointing as king and subsequent failures. This moment reflects the ongoing struggle between obedience to God and the political realities of leadership.<p><b>and Saul worshiped the LORD</b><br>Despite Saul's disobedience, this phrase shows his attempt to maintain a semblance of religious devotion. Worship in ancient Israel involved sacrifices, offerings, and public acts of reverence, often conducted at altars or high places. Saul's worship here may be seen as an effort to regain favor with God or to publicly demonstrate his piety to the people. This act of worship, however, is overshadowed by the earlier pronouncement of God's rejection of Saul as king. It serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience over ritual, echoing the prophetic message found in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where Samuel declares that obedience is better than sacrifice. Saul's worship, while outwardly correct, lacks the inward submission and repentance that God desires. This moment foreshadows the eventual rise of David, a man after God's own heart, who would embody true worship and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a key figure in the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

This underlines Samuel&#8217;s role as God&#8217;s representative even when the king is disobedient. Compare <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10&#8211;14</a>, where Moses remains near a rebellious people, and <a href="/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5&#8211;6</a>, where Isaiah returns to Hezekiah with God&#8217;s message.<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s return is not an endorsement of Saul&#8217;s rebellion (see <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>) but a public act to finish the task of executing Agag (vv. 32&#8211;33). The prophet&#8217;s loyalty is ultimately to the LORD&#8217;s command, not to human leadership (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; It also models patient, steadfast ministry: Samuel stays long enough to confront sin and call for true repentance (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Saul</b><p>Saul had pleaded, &#8220;Honor me now before the elders of my people&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The king is focused on appearances&#8212;wanting the prophet beside him so he does not lose face. Similar concern for public image is seen in King Jeroboam&#8217;s cry to the unnamed prophet (<a href="/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>) and in Herod&#8217;s fear of reputation (<a href="/mark/6-26.htm">Mark 6:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows Samuel&#8217;s presence, but the narrative will soon show the distance between their hearts (<a href="/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a>). The companionship is temporary; the rupture in Saul&#8217;s relationship with the LORD is not repaired (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This scene warns that external associations (religious leaders, rituals, titles) cannot cover inner disobedience (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Saul worshiped the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to His voice? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul bows, offers sacrifice, or engages in liturgy, yet moments earlier he disobeyed clear commands. The tension between outward worship and inward rebellion echoes <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> and <a href="/mark/7-6.htm">Mark 7:6&#8211;7</a>.<p>&#8226; True worship springs from submission (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16&#8211;17</a>). Saul&#8217;s acts may impress observers, but God looks at the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause still reveals God&#8217;s mercy: the door to worship is open, even for a flawed king. Yet without repentance, worship becomes empty form (<a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast Saul&#8217;s performance with Samuel&#8217;s decisive obedience in putting Agag to death&#8212;an acted sermon that &#8220;the word of the LORD endures forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-31.htm">1 Samuel 15:31</a> records a striking moment: God&#8217;s prophet accompanies a disobedient king, allowing public worship while privately pronouncing judgment. Samuel&#8217;s return demonstrates faithful ministry; Saul&#8217;s desire for honor exposes a heart fixated on image; Saul&#8217;s worship highlights the gulf between ceremony and obedience. The verse teaches that God still invites sinners to worship, yet genuine worship must flow from wholehearted submission to His revealed word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">So Samuel turned again after Saul.</span>--The prophet, after the repeated and pressing request of the king, consents publicly to worship the Lord in his company. There is little doubt but that the principal motive which induced Samuel on this occasion not to withdraw himself from the public thanksgiving was a desire to prevent any disaffection towards the monarchy. His known disapproval of Saul's conduct, and his declining the king's earnest prayer to stay, would probably have been the signal to the discontented spirits in Israel to revolt, under the pretext that such a revolt would be pleasing to the great seer. Such a revolt in those critical times would have been disastrous to the growing prosperity of the chosen people.<p>It has been well suggested that many blessings came upon the unhappy Saul and the nation over which he ruled in answer to Samuel's intercession on this occasion for him.<p>The result was what might have been looked for. Saul remained in undiminished power apparently; but the will of God, as declared by His servant Samuel, was slowly, but surely, accomplished. The doom of the reigning family pronounced by the prophet on this momentous occasion was irrevocable.<p>The story of Israel contained in this book shows how the march of events in solemn procession moved onward, every year bringing the ill-fated rebel king nearer the execution of the stern sentence which his own self-willed conduct had called down on him.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
