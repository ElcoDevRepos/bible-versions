The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting Jesse presented all his sons whom he thought were suitable for kingship. This act of presenting sons before a prophet for selection is reminiscent of the process of choosing leaders or priests, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament. The setting is Bethlehem, a small town with significant future importance as the birthplace of Jesus Christ, connecting David's anointing with messianic prophecy.<p><b>but Samuel told him</b><br>Samuel, the last judge and a prophet, plays a crucial role in transitioning Israel from a theocracy to a monarchy. His authority as God's spokesperson is evident as he communicates God's will directly. Samuel's role is pivotal, as he anoints the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David, highlighting the divine choice in leadership. This moment underscores the importance of prophetic guidance in Israel's history.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has not chosen any of these.&#8221;</b><br>The LORD's choice is central to the narrative, emphasizing divine sovereignty in leadership selection. This statement reflects God's criteria, which differ from human expectations, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearance. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where God often chooses the unlikely or humble to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>. The rejection of Jesse's seven sons foreshadows the selection of David, the youngest and least likely candidate, prefiguring Christ, who was also underestimated and rejected by many.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David, a Bethlehemite, who presented his sons to the prophet Samuel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet of God, tasked with anointing the next king of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, he is the youngest son of Jesse and the one ultimately chosen by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The town where Jesse and his family lived, and where this event took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who guides Samuel in choosing the next king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_choice.htm">God's Sovereignty in Choice</a></b><br>God&#8217;s selection is based on His divine wisdom and purpose, not human standards.

In His covenant dealings, He often bypasses firstborn rights (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; 48:13&#8211;20), underscoring that divine election, not human custom, sets the agenda.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Samuel told him</b><p>&#8226; Samuel, the prophet who once anointed Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), now listens carefully for God&#8217;s correction, modeling obedience over assumption.<p>&#8226; His willingness to halt the process shows spiritual discernment: he refuses to rubber-stamp any candidate without clear divine approval (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment also reinforces accountability. Even Jesse, a respected elder of Bethlehem, hears a gentle &#8220;no&#8221; from God&#8217;s spokesman&#8212;paralleling Nathan&#8217;s later words to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds readers that leaders must wait for God&#8217;s timing and voice rather than rush decisions (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The LORD has not chosen any of these.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The decisive verdict highlights God&#8217;s intimate involvement in choosing His servants (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejection here is not condemnation of character; it simply means none fits God&#8217;s specific plan for kingship. Eliab and his brothers can still serve faithfully, as later seen when they join Saul&#8217;s army (<a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The sentence paves the way for David, the unexpected eighth son, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise of a king &#8220;after His own heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p>&#8226; By emphasizing divine choice, the passage foreshadows the ultimate Anointed One, Jesus Christ, likewise overlooked by many yet chosen by the Father (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesse confidently presents seven sons, yet each is passed over as Samuel listens for God&#8217;s confirmation.

The scene sets the stage for David&#8217;s emergence and ultimately points to God&#8217;s consistent pattern: He sovereignly chooses servants who fulfill His redemptive purposes, reminding believers to value His voice above every cultural or personal preference.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Seven of his sons</span>.--These seven, with David, the youngest, make eight.
