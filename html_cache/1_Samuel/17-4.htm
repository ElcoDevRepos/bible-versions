Goliath's role as a champion highlights the Philistine strategy of single combat to decide the outcome of the battle, a practice seen in ancient warfare. Goliath's name, meaning "exile" or "soothsayer," may reflect his role as a formidable opponent and a figure of intimidation. His presence sets the stage for a confrontation that emphasizes God's power over human strength.<p><b>who was from Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, located in the coastal region of Canaan. Archaeological evidence suggests Gath was a significant and fortified city during this period. The Philistines were known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, which gave them an advantage over the Israelites. Gath's association with giants is noted in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20-22</a>, where other descendants of giants are mentioned.<p><b>came out from the Philistine camp</b><br>The Philistines were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal plains of Canaan. Their camp was likely positioned strategically to challenge Israelite forces. The act of Goliath coming out from the camp signifies a direct challenge to Israel, emphasizing the Philistines' confidence in their champion. This scene sets the stage for the dramatic encounter between David and Goliath, highlighting the tension between the two nations.<p><b>He was six cubits and a span in height</b><br>A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, and a span is approximately 9 inches, making Goliath's height around 9 feet 9 inches. This extraordinary height would have made Goliath an imposing figure, contributing to the fear he instilled in the Israelite army. The description of Goliath's size underscores the seemingly insurmountable challenge he posed, setting the stage for a demonstration of God's power through David. This account foreshadows the New Testament theme of God using the weak to confound the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A giant warrior from Gath, representing the Philistine army.

Every detail heightens the contrast between visible strength and unseen faith, preparing us to see God&#8217;s glory revealed through the unlikely victory of David and, ultimately, through every act of deliverance He works for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A champion.</span> Literally, "a man of the two middles," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who enters the space between the two armies in order to decide the contest by a single combat. <span class="cmt_word">Of Gath.</span> In <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a> this town is mentioned, together with Gaza and Ashdod, as still having among its inhabitants men of the race of Anak. <span class="cmt_word">Whose height was six cubits and a span.</span> In our measure his height was eight feet five and one-third inches; for the cubit is sixteen inches, and the span (really the hand-breadth) is five and one-third inches. A span, <span class="accented">sit</span>, is eight inches, but the word used here is <span class="accented">zereth.</span> See on these measures, Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 79. This height, though very great, has been attained to in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">Armed with a coat of mail.</span> Literally, "clothed in a shirt of scales," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a corselet made of metal scales sewn on cloth so as to overlap one another. It was flexible, and protected the back and sides as well as the kent. <span class="cmt_word">Five thousand shekels of brass.</span> Really copper, as brass was then unknown. Conder gives the shekel as equal to two-thirds of an ounce. This would make the corselet weigh at least two hundred weight, an enormous load to carry even for a short time. Goliath's other equipments correspond in heaviness, and largely exceed the weight of medieval suits of armour. <span class="cmt_word">Greaves of brass upon his legs.</span> The thighs were protected by the corselet, so that only the legs required defensive armour. This would account for the weight of the corselet, as it was much longer than the cuirass, as worn by the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">A target.</span> Really, "a javelin." It was carried at the back, ready to be taken in the hand and thrown at the enemy when required. The versions have a different reading - <span class="accented">magan</span>, shield, for <span class="accented">chidon</span>, javelin. The shield was carried before him by an armour bearer. <span class="cmt_word">The staff.</span> The written text has a word which usually signifies <span class="accented">shaft, arrow</span>, for which the Kri substitutes <span class="accented">wood</span>, the noun actually found in <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; but most probably the word used here is an archaic name for the handle or staff of a spear. <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels.</span> The weight of the iron head of the spear would be about twenty-five pounds. However tall and strong Goliath may have been, yet with all this vast weight of metal his movements must have been slow and unready. He was got up, in bet, more to tell upon the imagination than for real fighting, and though, like a castle, he might have been invincible if attacked with sword and spear, he was much too encumbered with defensive armour to be capable of assuming the offensive against a light armed enemy. To David belongs the credit of seeing that the Philistine champion was a huge imposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a champion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">named</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
