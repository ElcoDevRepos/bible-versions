This area is significant in the narrative of David's life as it was a place where he sought refuge while fleeing from King Saul. The Ziphites' decision to inform Saul of David's whereabouts reflects the political tension and divided loyalties within Israel during this period. Ziph's location is strategic, providing a vantage point for observing movements in the surrounding wilderness. This act of betrayal by the Ziphites is later referenced in <a href="/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>, where David calls upon God for deliverance from his enemies.<p><b>Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon</b><br>The Wilderness of Maon is part of the larger Judean wilderness, characterized by its rugged terrain and sparse vegetation. This area provided natural fortifications and hiding places for David and his men. The wilderness experience is a recurring theme in David's life, symbolizing both physical and spiritual trials. It is in these desolate places that David often composed psalms, expressing his reliance on God for protection and guidance. The wilderness also serves as a type of Christ's own time in the wilderness, where He faced temptation and emerged victorious.<p><b>in the Arabah south of Jeshimon</b><br>The Arabah refers to the desert region stretching from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. It is a harsh environment, emphasizing the severity of David's circumstances as he evades Saul. The term "Jeshimon" means "desolation," further highlighting the barrenness of the area. This setting underscores the theme of God's provision and faithfulness, as David survives in such inhospitable conditions. The geographical details also serve to authenticate the historical narrative, providing a tangible context for the events described. The Arabah's desolation contrasts with the spiritual sustenance David receives from God, prefiguring the spiritual nourishment Christ offers in the midst of life's deserts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks to kill him.

Ziph lay within Judah&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>), which makes the betrayal all the more stinging; David is being hunted by members of his own tribe.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Ahead of Saul&#8221; reveals the Ziphites as scouts paving the way for Saul&#8217;s army. Their actions parallel Doeg&#8217;s earlier treachery in Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9&#8211;10</a>) and foreshadow their second attempt in <a href="/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1</a>.<p>&#8226; God allows this betrayal but limits its success; earlier He had promised David deliverance (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). <a href="/bsb/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>&#8217;s title links directly to this moment, showing David turning immediate danger into worship and trust.<p>Key takeaway: Human schemes move forward, but the Lord&#8217;s covenant with David remains untouched (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon</b><p>&#8220;Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s location shifts from the forest of Hereth (<a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>) to Keilah (23:5) to the Wilderness of Ziph (23:14) and now to Maon. Each move underscores his life as a fugitive yet also God&#8217;s precise guidance (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wilderness of Maon&#8221; is rugged desert terrain&#8212;remote, hard to navigate, ideal for concealment. It reminds us of Israel&#8217;s formative wilderness years (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>) and of Elijah&#8217;s future refuge in a similar region (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Arabah south of Jeshimon&#8221; pinpoints the deep rift valley running toward the Dead Sea. Such detail testifies to the historical reliability of the narrative.<p>&#8226; David is not alone; &#8220;his men&#8221; now number about six hundred (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>). God is forming a loyal core that will later stabilize the kingdom (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This setting becomes the stage for a dramatic rescue: Saul nearly encircles David on &#8220;the Rock of Escape&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26&#8211;28</a>), but God interrupts with a Philistine invasion, forcing Saul to withdraw. The wilderness that seems to trap David actually delivers him&#8212;consistent with <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>.<p>Practical reflection: Times of isolation can be God-appointed classrooms where faith muscles strengthen (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24</a> captures two simultaneous movements: the Ziphites rushing to aid Saul and David remaining concealed in Maon. The verse exposes human betrayal, highlights precise geography that reinforces Scripture&#8217;s accuracy, and prepares us for God&#8217;s timely intervention. Though enemies plot, the Lord&#8217;s anointed is preserved; the very wilderness meant to swallow David becomes a place of providential protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">In the wilderness of Maon.</span>--Still further to the south.

We can well imagine how gladly the dwellers in Judea, especially in later days--after the glorious reign of David had changed the tribes struggling with the surrounding petty nations for very existence into a great and renowned nation--would trace out the itinerary of the great king as he fled for his life before Saul. Is it too much to assume that each of these spots, which to us is little more than a hard, dry name, for a long period were the resort of reverent and curious pilgrims, anxious to gaze on localities made sacred by the weary wanderings and the hair-breadth escapes of the glorious king of Israel?<p><span class= "bld">The plain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Arabah, </span>the desert track which extends along the Jordan Valley from the Dead Sea to the Lake of Gennesareth; it is now called El-Ghor.
