This indicates David's fame had spread even among Israel's enemies. The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, and Gath was one of their major cities. Achish's servants likely viewed David with suspicion due to his reputation as a formidable warrior.<p><b>&#8220;Is this not David, the king of the land?</b><br>Although David was not yet officially king, he was anointed by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and recognized by many as the future leader of Israel.

This foreshadows David's eventual kingship and God's plan for him to lead Israel.<p><b>Did they not sing about him in their dances,</b><br>This refers to the popular songs sung by the women of Israel after David's victories, particularly after his defeat of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-7</a>).

Their reaction safeguards David from settling in Philistia and keeps him on course for the throne God promised. The verse underscores God&#8217;s ability to use even hostile voices to confirm His plans and to highlight the rising leader through whom He will shepherd His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Is not this David?</span>--Some expositors have supposed, but quite needlessly, that it was the sword of Goliath which betrayed the identity of the hero; but although David in his humility did not suspect how widely spread was his fame, he was evidently as well known in Philistia as in his own land. That popular lilt, the folk-song of the Israelitish maidens, which sang of the prowess of David, the son of Jesse, was no doubt current in frontier towns like Gath, and at once the fugitive was recognised. We hear of no attempt made upon his life, or even against his liberty. The feeling among his generous foes was rather pitiful admiration mingled with wonder at seeing the doer of such splendid achievements in poverty and in exile.<p><span class= "bld">David the king.</span>--Here, again, the title king is vaguely used. Neither the people of Gath nor his own countrymen--save, perhaps, a few chosen spirits--knew of the sacred anointing by Samuel at Bethlehem. The appellation simply means: Is not this the renowned warrior, the greatest man in Israel of whom the people sing? Saul, our sovereign, has been a valiant captain over us, and has slain his thousands; but this one is greater still, he has slain his ten thousands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David the king of the land.</span> The servants of Achish use the title of king in a very general way. Thus Achish, though really a <span class="accented">seren</span> (see on 1 Samuel 5:11), is called king of Gath; and they meant nothing more as regards David than that he was Israel's great man, though in accepting Goliath's challenge he had undertaken what in old time was regarded as the king's especial duty. <span class="cmt_word">Did they not sing one to another of him in dances?</span> The Hebrew method of singing was by choruses, who sang and danced in turns to the music of their tambours (see on 1 Samuel 18:7). David evidently had hoped not to be recognised, but to be admitted to serve as a soldier, or in some other capacity, without many questions being asked. As we find an Edomite in Saul's service, Cushites, Maachathites, and other foreigners in the employment of David, there was probably much of this desertion of one service for another, especially as kings in those days had absolute authority and their displeasure was death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;&#7695;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Achish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_397.htm">Strong's 397: </a> </span><span class="str2">Achish -- king of Gath</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;[Is] this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the land?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Did they not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6030.htm">Strong's 6030: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer, respond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
