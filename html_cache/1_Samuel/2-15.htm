The priests' actions here show a blatant disregard for God's commands, highlighting their corruption and disrespect for sacred practices. This phrase sets the stage for the sinful behavior of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were priests at Shiloh.<p><b>the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing</b><br>The priests employed servants to carry out their demands, indicating a system of abuse and exploitation. This reflects the hierarchical structure within the temple service, where those in power could manipulate religious practices for personal gain. The man sacrificing represents the faithful Israelite coming to worship, whose offerings were being mishandled.<p><b>&#8220;Give the priest some meat to roast</b><br>The demand for roasted meat instead of boiled meat signifies a preference for personal taste over divine ordinance. Roasting meat was considered a luxury compared to boiling, which was the prescribed method for certain offerings. This reflects the priests' self-indulgence and lack of reverence for God's laws.<p><b>because he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.&#8221;</b><br>The insistence on receiving raw meat before the fat was burned contravenes the sacrificial laws, which required the fat to be offered to God first. This act of taking raw meat symbolizes the priests' greed and their prioritization of personal desires over their sacred duties. It also foreshadows the judgment that would come upon Eli's house due to their contempt for the Lord's offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29-34</a>).
