It was a period when shepherds and landowners would gather to shear the wool from their flocks, often resulting in a time of feasting and hospitality. This context sets the stage for the narrative, as it was customary to share the abundance with others, especially those who had provided protection or assistance. The timing of this event is crucial, as it provides the backdrop for David's request to Nabal, highlighting the expectation of generosity during such prosperous times.<p><b>When your shepherds were with us,</b><br>David and his men had been in the wilderness of Paran, near Carmel, where Nabal's shepherds were tending their flocks. This phrase indicates a period of interaction between David's men and Nabal's shepherds. David's presence in the area was significant, as he was a fugitive from King Saul, yet he maintained a peaceful and protective stance towards the local shepherds. This reflects David's leadership qualities and his ability to maintain order and goodwill even while on the run.<p><b>we did not harass them,</b><br>David's assurance that his men did not harass Nabal's shepherds underscores the ethical conduct of David and his followers. In a time when banditry and raiding were common, David's restraint and protection of the shepherds were notable. This behavior aligns with biblical principles of justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>, which advises against plotting harm against a neighbor. David's actions here can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Good Shepherd, protecting His flock.<p><b>and nothing of theirs was missing</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the integrity and honesty of David's men. In a culture where theft and loss were common, the fact that nothing was missing from Nabal's flocks speaks to the trustworthiness of David's group. This mirrors the biblical theme of stewardship and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, where those who are faithful with little are also faithful with much. David's men acted as faithful stewards, ensuring the safety and security of the resources entrusted to them.<p><b>the whole time they were in Carmel.</b><br>Carmel, a region known for its fertile land and agricultural productivity, serves as the setting for this narrative. The mention of Carmel highlights the duration and consistency of David's protection over Nabal's shepherds. This ongoing protection further establishes David's reputation as a leader who values peace and security. The geographical context of Carmel, with its rich pastures, also underscores the potential wealth and resources available to Nabal, making his later refusal of David's request even more significant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently leading a group of men while on the run from King Saul.

The verse teaches that God honors righteous conduct, expects gratitude toward those who safeguard His blessings, and showcases how His chosen servants embody protective care long before they wear a crown.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Neither was there ought missing unto them.</span>--These words doubtless refer to the protection which David's armed band had afforded to the herdsmen against the frequent raids of the neighbouring people--the Philistines and other more savage and unscrupulous tribes who dwelt on the borders of Palestine. The request was certainly a fair one, for, as Lange and Ewald remark, "apart from the Eastern custom of giving largely at such great merry-makings, according to which such a request would seem in no way strange, David had a certain right to ask a gift from Nabal's wealth. He had indirectly no small share in the festal joy of Nabal and his house. Without some part of the superfluity of the inhabitants whom he protected, he could not have maintained himself and his army."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
