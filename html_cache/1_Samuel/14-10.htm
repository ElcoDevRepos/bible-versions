Jonathan, the son of King Saul, is seeking a sign from God to determine His will. In the ancient Near Eastern context, seeking signs was a common practice to ascertain divine guidance. This moment is reminiscent of Gideon's fleece test in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>, where Gideon also sought confirmation from God. The phrase indicates Jonathan's reliance on God's direction rather than human wisdom or military strategy.<p><b>then we will go up,</b><br>The act of going up signifies an advance into enemy territory, which in this case is the Philistine garrison. The geographical context is significant here; the Israelites were positioned in a lower area, and the Philistines were on higher ground, making the ascent a tactical challenge. This phrase demonstrates Jonathan's courage and trust in God's promise, echoing the faith of other biblical figures who acted on divine assurance, such as David facing Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>.<p><b>because this will be our sign</b><br>In the biblical narrative, signs often serve as confirmations of God's will or presence. This phrase underscores the importance of divine signs in the life of Israel, as seen in the story of Moses and the burning bush (Exodus 3) or the signs given to Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8-11</a>). Jonathan's request for a sign reflects a deep-seated belief in God's active involvement in the affairs of His people, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>that the LORD has delivered them into our hands.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a declaration of faith in God's sovereignty and power. The concept of God delivering enemies into the hands of His people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the victories of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>). It highlights the belief that success in battle is not due to human strength but to divine intervention. This foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who conquers sin and death, delivering believers from spiritual enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

By stating, &#8220;But if they say,&#8221; he shows that he expects God to speak through the ordinary words of the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-9.htm">1 Samuel 14:9-10</a>).<p>- Scripture often records believers asking God for unmistakable clarity before acting. Compare Gideon&#8217;s fleece in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a> and David&#8217;s inquiry in <a href="/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23-24</a>.<p>- The condition is not doubt-driven but discernment-driven; Jonathan believes God can guide through human speech just as easily as through a prophet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Come on up&#8217;</b><p>- The Philistines&#8217; invitation would look, humanly speaking, like a challenge to fight on their own high ground&#8212;an apparent disadvantage.<p>- God delights in turning apparent disadvantages into victories (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>- Jonathan&#8217;s request focuses on words, not circumstances. He is listening for God&#8217;s cue, not reading the terrain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then we will go up</b><p>- Immediate obedience is assumed. Once the pre-arranged sign occurs, there is no need for further debate.<p>- Obedient action always follows genuine faith (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>- Jonathan&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8221; includes his armor-bearer, illustrating how faith can inspire others to join in courageous obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/14-7.htm">1 Samuel 14:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because this will be our sign</b><p>- Jonathan expects supernatural confirmation in a very natural form. Signs in Scripture often attach to everyday realities: a baby wrapped in cloths (<a href="/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12</a>) or rustling treetops (<a href="/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a>).<p>- He is not testing God arrogantly; he is seeking the Lord&#8217;s predetermined indicator so that the glory clearly rests with Him (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD has delivered them into our hands</b><p>- The victory is declared before the battle begins. Using the perfect tense (&#8220;has delivered&#8221;) reflects absolute confidence in God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>).<p>- &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>). Jonathan&#8217;s words echo this enduring truth.<p>- The phrase underscores a biblical pattern: God grants triumph so His people may acknowledge His power, not their own skill (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-10.htm">1 Samuel 14:10</a> shows Jonathan setting a simple, God-directed condition: if the Philistines call him up, he will climb, knowing the LORD has already secured the outcome. The verse illustrates discernment, immediate obedience, and unwavering confidence that victory belongs to God alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A sign.</span> The waiting of the garrison for Jonathan and his armour bearer to mount up to them would be a sign of great indifference and supineness on their part; but what he rather meant was that they were to regard it as an omen. Kim'hi has a long digression in his commentary on this place to show that there was nothing superstitous in their looking for a prognostic to encourage them in their hazardous undertaking. God, he says, bade Gideon go to the camp of the Midianites to obtain such a sign. as Jonathan looked for here (see <a href="/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
