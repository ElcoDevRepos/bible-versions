Saul, though anointed as king, was still engaged in everyday labor, indicating the transitional period of Israel from a theocracy to a monarchy. This setting underscores the contrast between Saul's current life and his future role as king. The use of oxen for plowing fields was common in ancient Israel, emphasizing the agricultural society of the time.<p><b>&#8220;What troubles the people?&#8221; asked Saul.</b><br>Saul's inquiry demonstrates his concern for the people, a quality expected of a leader. This moment foreshadows his role as a protector and deliverer of Israel. The question also indicates Saul's initial ignorance of the crisis, suggesting a disconnect between him and the political affairs of the nation, which may reflect the decentralized nature of Israelite society before the establishment of a strong monarchy.<p><b>&#8220;Why are they weeping?&#8221;</b><br>The weeping of the people signifies a communal distress, often seen in the Old Testament as a response to threats or calamities. This emotional reaction is indicative of the gravity of the situation faced by the Israelites, specifically the threat from Nahash the Ammonite. Weeping in biblical texts often precedes divine intervention or the rise of a deliverer, setting the stage for Saul's leadership.<p><b>And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh.</b><br>The men from Jabesh Gilead were under siege by Nahash the Ammonite, who threatened to gouge out the right eye of every man, a tactic meant to disgrace and incapacitate them. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of Israel's need for a king to unify and protect them from external threats. The mention of Jabesh Gilead also ties back to the tribe of Benjamin, Saul's own tribe, as the people of Jabesh had previously shown kindness to the Benjamites (<a href="/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8-14</a>), creating a personal connection for Saul.

At first this would seem strange, but it must be remembered that the regal authority was something quite new in republican Israel, and that the new king's duties and privileges at first were vague, and but little understood; besides which, jealousies, such as have already been noticed (<a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm" title="But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.">1Samuel 10:27</a>), no doubt induced Saul and his advisers to keep the royalty in the background till some opportunity for bringing it to the front should present itself. It is, therefore, quite to be understood that the newly-elected king should be spending at least a portion of his time in pursuits which hitherto had occupied his whole life. He was not the first hero summoned from agricultural labours to assume, in a national emergency, the command of an army. Gideon, we read, was called from the threshing-floor to do his great deeds; and to quote from profane history, one of the noblest of the sons of Rome, like Saul, was ploughing when the Senate fetched him to be the dictator and the general of their armies; and to the plough we know that that great man returned when his work was successfully accomplished and his country saved.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Just then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
