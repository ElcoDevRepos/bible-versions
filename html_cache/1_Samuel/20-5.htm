Their friendship is a central theme in this narrative, highlighting loyalty and covenantal love. David's communication with Jonathan is crucial as it reflects the trust and bond between them, despite the tension with Saul.<p><b>Look, tomorrow is the New Moon</b><br>The New Moon was a significant time in the Hebrew calendar, marking the beginning of a new month. It was often observed with special sacrifices and feasts (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). This context indicates that David, as a member of Saul's court, was expected to participate in the royal feast, which was customary during such observances.<p><b>and I am supposed to dine with the king</b><br>David's expected presence at the king's table signifies his high status and favor in Saul's court. However, it also places him in a precarious position due to Saul's growing jealousy and intent to harm him. This tension is a recurring theme in David's life, illustrating the trials he faces before ascending to the throne.<p><b>Instead, let me go and hide in the field</b><br>David's decision to hide underscores his awareness of Saul's hostility. The field represents a place of refuge and safety, away from the king's reach. This act of hiding is symbolic of David's reliance on God's protection, as he often sought refuge in the wilderness during times of danger (<a href="/psalms/57.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>).<p><b>until the third evening from now</b><br>The specific mention of "the third evening" suggests a planned period of absence, allowing time for Jonathan to gauge Saul's intentions. The number three often holds significance in biblical narratives, symbolizing completeness or divine intervention. David's strategic planning reflects his wisdom and discernment in navigating the threats against him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently serving in King Saul's court.

The episode teaches believers to blend trust in God with thoughtful action, to honor sacred gatherings, and to rely on faithful companions when confronting danger and discerning truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The new moon.</span>--On the religious ceremonies connected with the day of the new moon at the beginning of each month, see the Mosaic enactments in <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm" title="Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;">Numbers 28:11-15</a>.<p>At the court of Saul the feast seems to have been carefully observed, doubtless with the blast of trumpets, and with solemn burnt offerings and sin offerings, for we notice in this narrative that the plea of possible ceremonial uncleanness was at once accepted as an excuse for absence. (See <a href="/1_samuel/20-26.htm" title="Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.">1Samuel 20:26</a>.)<p>The sacrificial and ceremonial rites were accompanied by a state and family banquet, at which David, as the king's son-in-law, and also as holding a high post in the royal army, was expected to be present.<p>Jonathan persisted in looking upon his father's later designs against the life of David as simply frenzied acts, incident upon his distressing malady, and evidently believed that after his strange seizure at Ramah he would return, and treat David with the confidence of old days when he met him at the feast of the new moon. David, however, believed otherwise, and was convinced, to use his own expressive words, that there was but a step between him and death. He would not trust himself, therefore, to Saul's hands until his friend had made the experiment he suggested.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow is the new moon</span>. The first day of the new moon was a joyful festival, its appearance being greeted with the sounding of trumpets, and celebrated by a burnt offering and a sin offering. It was, moreover, kept by Saul as a family festival, at which David, as his son-in-law, was expected to be present. As, moreover, David was to hide <span class="cmt_word">unto the third day at even</span>, counting from the time when he was arranging his plans with Jonathan, it is plain that it was the rule to prolong the feasting unto the second day. When then Jonathan, convinced by David's pleading, had consented to aid him in his own way, they arrange that he shall absent himself from this festival, and remain during it hidden out of sight. In case Saul missed him and asked the reason of his absence, Jonathan was to offer as an excuse for him that he had earnestly requested leave to pay a hurried visit to Bethlehem, in order to be present at an annual festival: and if Saul took the excuse in good part it would be a sign that he had no malicious purposes towards David, whereas if he fell into a rage it would be a proof of a settled evil design. <span class="cmt_word">A yearly sacrifice for all the family.</span> For all the <span class="accented">mishpachah, i.e.</span> not for all Jesse's household, but for all that subdivision of the tribe of Judah to which Jesse belonged; for a tribe was divided into families, and these again into fathers' houses (<a href="/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16, 17</a>). The occasion would thus be a grand one. In <a href="/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a> we have an instance of a special sacrifice at Bethlehem, but this feast of the <span class="accented">mishpachah</span> was held every year; and evidently before the temple was built at Jerusalem these local sacrifices were the rule.
