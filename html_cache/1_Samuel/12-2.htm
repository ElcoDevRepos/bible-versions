The king "walking before" the people signifies his role as a leader and representative. This moment fulfills the people's request for a king to lead them, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>. The king's presence symbolizes a shift in governance, reflecting the people's desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>). This transition is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon, and ultimately points to the future Messianic King, Jesus Christ, who will perfectly fulfill the role of a righteous and eternal king.<p><b>and I am old and gray</b><br>Samuel's acknowledgment of his age underscores his long service and faithfulness to God and Israel. His "old and gray" status lends weight to his words, as he speaks with the authority and wisdom of a life dedicated to God's service. This phrase also highlights the natural progression of leadership, as Samuel prepares to pass the mantle to the newly anointed king. Samuel's life parallels other biblical figures who served God into their old age, such as Moses and Joshua, emphasizing the value of lifelong faithfulness.<p><b>and my sons are here with you</b><br>Samuel's mention of his sons, who are present among the people, serves as a reminder of their previous failure in leadership. In <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>, it is noted that Samuel's sons did not walk in his ways and were corrupt judges. This reference underscores the need for a new form of leadership, as the people's dissatisfaction with Samuel's sons partly motivated their demand for a king. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of righteous leadership and the consequences of failing to uphold God's standards.<p><b>I have walked before you from my youth until this day</b><br>Samuel's statement about his lifelong service to Israel highlights his integrity and dedication. From his miraculous birth and early dedication to God (1 Samuel 1-2), Samuel has been a faithful servant, prophet, and judge. His "walking before" the people signifies his role as a spiritual leader and mediator between God and Israel. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of walking with God, as seen in figures like Enoch and Noah, who "walked with God" (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24, 6</a>:9). Samuel's life of service foreshadows the ultimate Servant, Jesus Christ, who perfectly walked in obedience to the Father and served humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and last judge of Israel, who served as a bridge between the period of the judges and the establishment of the monarchy.

Samuel&#8217;s age, his family&#8217;s visibility, and his lifelong integrity frame the scene, reminding Israel&#8212;and every reader&#8212;that leadership changes, human strength fades, but faithfulness to God&#8217;s covenant endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And now, behold, the king walketh before you.</span>--No doubt, here pointing to Saul by his side. The term "walketh before you implied generally that the kingly office included the guiding and governing the people, as well as the especial duty of leading them in war; from henceforth they must accept his authority on all occasions, not merely in great emergencies. Both king and people must understand that the days when Saul could quietly betake himself to his old pursuits on the farm of the Ephraim hills were now past for ever. He must lead, and they must follow. The metaphor is taken from the usual place of a shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock. Compare the words of our Lord, who uses the same image of a shepherd walking before his sheep (<a href="/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27</a>): "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they <span class= "ital">follow </span>me."<p><span class= "bld">And I am old and grayheaded.</span>--Here the prophet, with some pathos, refers to the elders' own words at Ramah (chap 8:5). Yes, said the seer, I am old--grown grey in your service; listen to me while I ask you what manner of service that has been. Can any one find in it a flaw? has it not been pure and disinterested throughout?<p><span class= "bld">My sons are with you.</span>--Yes, old indeed, for my offspring are numbered now among the grown men of the people. Possibly, however, a tinge of mortified feeling at the rejection of himself and his family, mixed with a desire to recommend his sons to the favour and goodwill of the nation, is at the bottom of this mention of them.--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary. </span>It is evident that these sons, whose conduct as Samuel's deputies had excited the severest criticism on the part of the elders (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.">1Samuel 8:5</a>), had been reduced--with the full consent, of course, of their father, who up to this period exercised evidently supreme power in all the coasts of Israel--to the condition of mere private citizens.<p><span class= "bld">From my childhood unto this day.</span>--Samuel's life had in truth been constantly before the public observation from very early days; well known to all were the details of his career--his early consecration under peculiar and exceptional circumstances to the sanctuary service, the fact of the "word of the Lord" coming directly to him when still a boy, his recognition by the people directly afterwards as a prophet, then his restless, unwearied work during the dark days which followed the fall of Shiloh. It was indeed a public life. He would have Israel, now they had virtually rejected his rule, think over that long busy life of his for a moment, and then pronounce a judgment on it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king walketh before you</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> you have now one to protect and lead the nation, whereas my business was to raise its religious and moral life. The metaphor is taken from the position of the shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock to guide and guard them. On this account the word shepherd or pastor is used in the Bible of the temporal ruler (<a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, etc.), and not, as with us, of the spiritual guide. <span class="cmt_word">My sons are with you.</span> This is no mere confirmation of the fact just stated that he was old, but a direct challenge of their dissatisfaction with his sons' conduct, as far at least as concerns any connivance on his part, or support of them in their covetousness.
