David, anointed by Samuel as the future king, was seen as a threat to Saul's reign. The discovery of David's location highlights the tension and danger David faced. This pursuit is a recurring theme, illustrating Saul's growing paranoia and the divine protection over David. The phrase also sets the stage for the events that follow, showing the relentless nature of Saul's pursuit.<p><b>At that time Saul was sitting under the tamarisk tree</b><br>The tamarisk tree is significant as it provides shade and is often associated with places of rest or decision-making in the ancient Near East. Saul's choice to sit under this tree may symbolize a moment of contemplation or authority. Trees in biblical narratives often serve as landmarks or places of significant events, such as Abraham's oak at Mamre. The tamarisk tree here may also symbolize Saul's temporary and fading reign, as trees can be seen as symbols of life and stability.<p><b>on the hill at Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was Saul's hometown and the center of his power. It is located in the territory of Benjamin, Saul's tribe. The hill at Gibeah provided a strategic vantage point, reflecting Saul's military mindset. Gibeah's history includes previous acts of violence and judgment, such as the events in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>, which may foreshadow the turmoil and bloodshed during Saul's reign.<p><b>with his spear in hand</b><br>The spear is a symbol of Saul's authority and his warrior status. It also represents his readiness for violence and his unstable mental state, as seen in previous attempts to kill David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a>). The spear in Saul's hand contrasts with David's reliance on God for protection and victory, highlighting the difference in their leadership and faith.<p><b>and all his servants standing around him.</b><br>The presence of Saul's servants indicates his kingly status and the loyalty of his followers. However, it also underscores the isolation Saul feels, as his paranoia grows and his trust diminishes. The servants' presence contrasts with David's band of loyal followers, who support him despite his fugitive status.

Sitting there signals that Saul feels secure, yet spiritual decay lurks beneath the surface.<p>&#8211; The tamarisk tree offers shade, a small picture of earthly comfort contrasting with Saul&#8217;s inner turmoil (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>, where Saul previously sat under a pomegranate tree while Jonathan acted in faith).<p>&#8211; A hilltop throne might look impressive, but true security comes only from obedience to God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8211; Geographical notes subtly remind us that the kingdom is still located in Benjamin, though God is preparing Judah&#8217;s David to rule from Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with his spear in hand</b><p>&#8211; The spear is Saul&#8217;s signature weapon and symbol of authority, yet it also recalls his repeated attempts to kill David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10&#8211;11</a>; 19:9&#8211;10).<p>&#8211; Gripping the spear suggests paranoia and violence, not shepherd&#8208;like leadership (contrast <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>, where David will &#8220;shepherd My people Israel&#8221;).<p>&#8211; The picture foreshadows what Saul is about to do to the priests at Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17&#8211;19</a>): the hand that holds the spear soon sheds innocent blood.<p>&#8211; In Scripture, righteous rulers wield power for protection; unrighteous rulers wield it for control (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his servants standing around him</b><p>&#8211; A circle of servants emphasizes Saul&#8217;s outward power, but their posture also reveals tension; they must await orders they may not agree with (note their hesitation in <a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Saul&#8217;s isolation is growing: he is surrounded, yet alone in spirit, unlike David, who attracts loyal companions (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene contrasts two kinds of kingdoms: one held together by fear, the other by covenant love (<a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8211; This snapshot warns leaders today: coercion may gather a crowd, but only godliness gains true allegiance (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a> paints a vivid picture of Saul&#8212;enthroned in outward splendor but consumed by insecurity.

Servants encircle him, but their presence cannot mask the erosion of his spiritual authority. The verse exposes the emptiness of power divorced from obedience to God and sets the stage for the tragic choices that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When Saul heard.</span>--No note of time is here given. Probably the return of David with a disciplined force to the land, and the pitching of an armed camp in the "forest of Hareth," excited anew Saul's jealous fears.<p><span class= "bld">Now Saul abode in Gibeah.</span>--In Gibeah of Saul, his own royal city. The LXX. wrongly render, instead of Gibeah, "on the hills." The margin of the English Version, "under a grove in a high place," is correct as regards the later words, <span class= "ital">baramah </span>signifying here upon the height. "Under a tree" is, however, nearer the original than "under a grove." The literal rendering would be "under a tamarisk tree." The sentence then should run, "Now Saul abode in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height." The tamarisk, which grows so abundantly on the sea-shore of England and in warmer climates, develops into a very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts. Saul's love for trees has been noticed before. This solemn council of his, when the darkest deed of his reign was decided upon, was held in the spot Saul loved so well, under the spreading tamarisk branches. There we see him, leaning, as was his wont in peace as in war, upon his tall spear, surrounded by his valiant captains, chosen apparently, with one exception, from his own tribe of Benjamin--the exception being his wicked counsellor, the Edomite Doeg, who was over the royal herds. This is one of the earliest councils we have any definite account of in the world's history. The king, surrounded by his chosen "fideles," complaining of the treason of one of them lately exiled from their midst, bewailing the want of fidelity of his son, the heir to the throne--then the stepping forward of one of these "fideles," one invested with high office, and publicly denouncing the chief religious official of the kingdom--forms a striking and vivid picture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Saul heard that David was discovered.</span> Hebrew, "was known." The meaning is easy enough, though rendered obscure by the involved translation of the A.V., and is as follows: When Saul heard that there was information concerning David and his men, he held a solemn council, in which we see how simple was the dignity of his court, but how great the ferocity to which he was now a prey. There is no parenthesis, but the account of Saul taking his seat, surrounded by his officers, follows directly upon the narration of the fact that news of David had reached him, and should be translated thus: "And Saul takes his seat in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height, holding his javelin (as a sceptre) in his hand, and all his officers stand in order by him." For Saul's fondness for trees see ch. 14:2; but at a time when there were no large buildings a branching tree formed a fit place for a numerous meeting. <span class="cmt_word">A tree.</span> Really a tamarisk tree, which "sometimes reaches such a size as to afford dense shade .... It is a very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts, closely clad with the minutest of leaves, and surmounted in spring with spikes of beautiful pink blossom" (Tristram, 'Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 357). It grows abundantly on the seashore of England, but requires a warmer climate to develope into a tree. In Spain beautiful specimens may be seen, as for instance at Pampeluna. <span class="cmt_word">In Ramah.</span> Conder (Handbook) thinks that Gibeah was the name of a district, which included Ramah; others take the word in its original signification, and render "on the height." <span class="cmt_word">Standing</span>. The word means that they took each their proper posts around him (See on 1 Samuel 10:23; 12:7, 16; 17:16). Saul was holding a formal court, to decide what steps should be taken now that David had openly revolted from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Soon Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">learned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
