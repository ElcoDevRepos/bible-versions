This highlights her wisdom and courage. Abigail's actions can be seen as a type of intercession, similar to how Christ intercedes on behalf of humanity. Her return signifies her commitment to her marriage despite Nabal's foolishness, reflecting the biblical principle of faithfulness.<p><b>there he was in the house</b><br>Nabal's presence in the house indicates his obliviousness to the danger he narrowly escaped due to Abigail's intervention. The house serves as a symbol of Nabal's self-centered world, disconnected from the reality outside. This setting contrasts with the open fields where David and his men were, emphasizing Nabal's isolation and ignorance.<p><b>holding a feast fit for a king</b><br>The feast signifies Nabal's wealth and self-indulgence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, feasts were often associated with celebrations and abundance. However, Nabal's feast is ironic, as he is unaware of the threat to his life. This mirrors the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where wealth and self-indulgence lead to spiritual blindness.<p><b>in high spirits and very drunk</b><br>Nabal's drunkenness underscores his lack of discernment and control, a common biblical theme warning against the dangers of excessive drinking (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). His inebriation contrasts with Abigail's sobriety and wisdom, highlighting the moral and spiritual gap between them. This state of drunkenness also foreshadows his vulnerability to divine judgment.<p><b>So she told him nothing until morning light</b><br>Abigail's decision to wait until morning to speak to Nabal demonstrates her prudence and understanding of timing. In biblical literature, light often symbolizes revelation and truth (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). By waiting for the morning light, Abigail ensures that Nabal is sober and able to comprehend the gravity of the situation, reflecting the wisdom of speaking truth at the right time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>A wise and discerning woman, the wife of Nabal.

Nabal may be taken as an extreme, though not an uncommon, example of the leading Israelites of the days <span class= "ital">before </span>Samuel; Abigail as the representative of the nobler spirit among the higher classes <span class= "ital">after </span>the spirit of Samuel had influenced the inhabitants of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he was very drunken.</span> Hebrew, "and he was very drunken." This was not the cause of his heart being merry, but the result; he gave himself up to enjoyment till he became drunken, and then his merriment was over. When Abigail came back he was stupefied by drink, and it was not until the next day, when his debauch was passing off, that he was capable of being told what his wife had done. And when Abigail recounted to him David's fierce resolve, and how she had pacified him, he seems to have given way to a fit of violent indignation, flying out possibly at her as he had at David's messengers (ver. 14), the result of which was an attack of apoplexy, and after lying in a state of insensibility for ten days, he died. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Abigail</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;
