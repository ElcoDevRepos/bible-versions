The context is a critical moment after Saul had made a rash oath that cursed anyone who ate before evening. Saul's command reflects his authority as king and the seriousness of the situation. This moment highlights the tension between Saul's leadership and the actions of his son, which is a recurring theme in 1 Samuel. Saul's leadership is often marked by impulsive decisions, contrasting with Jonathan's more measured and faithful character.<p><b>So Jonathan told him,</b><br>Jonathan's response to Saul's command is immediate and honest, demonstrating his integrity. This reflects the biblical principle of truthfulness and transparency, even when facing dire consequences. Jonathan's willingness to confess his actions shows his respect for his father and the authority structure, despite the potential personal cost.<p><b>&#8220;I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand.</b><br>Jonathan's action of tasting honey was innocent and unintentional in breaking Saul's oath. The honey symbolizes sustenance and enlightenment, often seen as a gift from God in the Bible. The staff in his hand signifies his role as a leader and warrior, and the act of tasting honey with it underscores the simplicity and innocence of his action. This incident also highlights the impracticality of Saul's oath, as it inadvertently endangered his own people.<p><b>And now I must die?&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan's rhetorical question underscores the injustice of the situation. It reflects the tension between human law and divine justice. Jonathan's potential death for such a minor infraction points to the flawed nature of Saul's leadership and foreshadows the eventual decline of Saul's reign. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where an innocent person faces death due to the failings of human authority, prefiguring Jesus' own unjust suffering and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The demand is direct, assuming absolute accountability before God and king. Since <a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a> records Saul&#8217;s oath that no one eat, the question presses for truth so that divine judgment can proceed, reflecting <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Saul commanded him&#8221;</b><p>As king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), Saul wields God-ordained authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Yet his oath was rash, akin to Jephthah&#8217;s vow in <a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-35</a>. The narrative shows how authority can be misapplied: Saul&#8217;s command here is procedural, but it is rooted in an earlier decree that ignored God&#8217;s gracious provision of honey for weary soldiers (<a href="/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25-30</a>). The verse reminds us that earthly leaders answer to the higher law of God (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;So Jonathan told him&#8221;</b><p>Jonathan responds with transparent integrity. He neither hides nor minimizes his action, embodying <a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;He who speaks truth declares righteousness.&#8221; His honesty also upholds <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, describing the one &#8220;who speaks truth in his heart.&#8221; Even when truth may cost his life, Jonathan refuses deceit, foreshadowing the believer&#8217;s call in <a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a> to &#8220;speak truth each one to his neighbor.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand&#8221;</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s explanation highlights the innocence of the act:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Only&#8221;&#8212;it was a minimal, unintended breach (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;A little honey&#8221;&#8212;the very food God set before the troops (<a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;With the end of the staff&#8221;&#8212;not gathered by hand, just a quick dip.<p>The phrase contrasts God&#8217;s provision with Saul&#8217;s prohibition, revealing the folly of human legalism that burdens rather than blesses (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>). God&#8217;s sweet gifts are meant for strength, not strangled by man-made restriction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And now I must die?&#8221;</b><p>Jonathan voices the logical outcome of Saul&#8217;s vow: death (cf. <a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>). He submits to the penalty, accepting personal responsibility even though the oath was ill-advised. Yet the narrative soon shows God&#8217;s mercy through the people&#8217;s intervention (<a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>). Scripture balances justice and mercy: while &#8220;the soul who sins shall die&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>) and &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), God often provides a substitute or deliverance pointing to the ultimate salvation fulfilled in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-43.htm">1 Samuel 14:43</a> exposes the collision between Saul&#8217;s rash legalism and Jonathan&#8217;s truthful humility. Saul demands confession; Jonathan gives it without evasion. The tasting of honey, though technically a breach, underscores how human vows can conflict with God&#8217;s life-giving provision. Jonathan&#8217;s readiness to die reveals integrity, while the surrounding passage (14:45) will showcase divine mercy that overrides misguided human decrees. The verse therefore teaches the believer to honor truth, test every human command against God&#8217;s Word, and trust the Lord who tempers justice with grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43, 44) <span class= "bld">Lo, I must die.</span>--These wild and thoughtless vows are peculiarly characteristic of this half-barbaric period. We have already observed that the age now closing had been peculiarly the age of vows. A similar terrible oath, equalling Saul's in its rashness, had been taken by Jephthah. It is noticeable that not only Saul, who vowed the vow, but Jonathan, its victim, were convinced that the vow, though perhaps hastily and rashly made, must be kept. "Against both these," says Erdman in <span class= "ital">Lange </span>with great force "rises the people's voice as the voice of God, the question (in <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm" title="And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.">1Samuel 14:45</a>), 'Shall Jonathan die? 'and the answer,' Far be it,' expresses the sorrowful astonishment and the energetic protest of the people, who were inspired by Jonathan's heroic deed and its brilliant result. . . . Over against Saul's oath the people set their own: <span class= "ital">'</span>As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.' Probably Saul was not unwilling in this awful question, when his son's life trembled in the balance, to submit his will for once to the people's."<p>"Take then no vow at random: ta'en in faith,<p>Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,<p>Blindly to execute a rash resolve,<p>Whom better it had suited to exclaim,<p>'I have done ill than to redeem his pledge<p>By doing worse."--Dante, <span class= "ital">Paradise, </span>5:63-68.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
