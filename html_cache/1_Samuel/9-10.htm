This moment is significant as it marks the beginning of Saul's journey towards kingship, a role he was initially unaware of. Saul's character is introduced here as someone who listens to advice, a trait that is both commendable and necessary for leadership. This phrase also highlights the servant's influence, suggesting that God can use anyone, regardless of social status, to guide His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;Come, let us go.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase demonstrates initiative and action, reflecting a readiness to pursue God's will. It echoes the biblical theme of seeking God&#8217;s guidance, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages trust in the Lord for direction. Saul's decision to go to the man of God is a step of faith, showing reliance on spiritual insight rather than solely on human wisdom. This action can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call to follow Christ, who is the ultimate "man of God."<p><b>So they set out for the city where the man of God was.</b><br>The city referred to is likely Ramah, where Samuel, the prophet, resided. This journey is not just a physical one but also a spiritual quest for understanding and revelation. The "man of God" is a term used for prophets, indicating someone who speaks on behalf of God, as seen with Moses and Elijah. This journey foreshadows Saul's anointing as king, a pivotal moment in Israel's history. The act of seeking out the man of God underscores the importance of prophetic guidance in the Old Testament, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, the ultimate prophet, priest, and king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who would later become the first king of Israel.

This openness shows humility; he does not cling to his own plan but values wise input&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a> and <a href="/exodus/18-24.htm">Exodus 18:24</a>.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;Good&#8221; reveals agreement that God may work through ordinary voices.
