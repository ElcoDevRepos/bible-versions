Names in biblical times often carried significant meaning, indicating the parents' faith or hopes for their children. Joel's name suggests a recognition of God's sovereignty, which is ironic given the later actions of Samuel's sons. This name is also shared by the prophet Joel, who authored the Book of Joel, emphasizing the importance of divine judgment and repentance.<p><b>and the name of his second was Abijah</b><br>Abijah means "My Father is Yahweh," further emphasizing the spiritual legacy intended by Samuel. This name underscores the expectation that Abijah would follow in the footsteps of his father, who was a faithful servant of God. The name Abijah is also found in other parts of the Bible, such as in the lineage of the kings of Judah, indicating its common use and the hope for leadership and faithfulness.<p><b>They were judges in Beersheba</b><br>Beersheba, located in the southern part of Israel, was a significant city in biblical history, often marking the southern boundary of the Promised Land. It was a place of covenant and worship, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac. The role of judges was to provide leadership and maintain justice, yet the context of <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a> reveals that Samuel's sons did not walk in his ways, leading to corruption and dissatisfaction among the Israelites. This failure contributed to the people's demand for a king, setting the stage for the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy. The location of Beersheba, far from the central religious sites, may have contributed to their isolation and subsequent moral decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge over Israel, who was instrumental in transitioning Israel from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Samuel, who served as a judge in Beersheba.

By naming Joel and Abijah and locating them in Beersheba, the Spirit shows how leadership can drift when separated from faithful oversight and personal devotion. The verse prepares us for Israel&#8217;s demand for a king by proving once again that human judges&#8212;even those sprouting from prophetic roots&#8212;cannot replace wholehearted obedience to the Lord who alone rules perfectly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The name of his firstborn was Joel.</span> The names of Samuel's sons are pledges of his faith - Joel meaning <span class="accented">Jehovah is God</span>, and Abiah <span class="accented">Jab is Father.</span> The name given in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-28.htm">1 Chronicles 6:28</a>, <span class="accented">Vashni</span>, is a mistake. It means, "and the second," the name of Joel the firstborn having somehow been omitted. The names of Saul's sons, and even of Jonathan's, unlike those in Samuel's family, bear witness to their religion having been of a curiously mixed character. <span class="cmt_word">In Beer-sheba.</span> Not, therefore, in any of the places to which Samuel went in person, and which were all near Ramah, his home. Beer-sheba was in the extreme south of the tribe of Judah (see on Genesis 21:31), on the Philistine border, and his being able to place his sons there in authority proves, not merely that his rule was acknowledged throughout the whole country, but also that the Philistines did not interfere much with the internal arrangements of the Israelites. Josephus ('Antiq.,' 6:3, 2) represents only one son as placed at Beer-sheba, and says that the other was judge at Dan, but it may be doubted whether the northern tribes were sufficiently under control to submit to be governed by a southern judge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;em-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8034.htm">Strong's 8034: </a> </span><span class="str2">A name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his firstborn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
