In ancient Israel, greeting someone was a sign of peace and goodwill. It reflects the cultural importance of community and fellowship. The act of greeting also signifies acceptance and acknowledgment of Saul's new role as king, as he is being recognized by others in the community.<p><b>and give you two loaves of bread</b><br>The giving of bread is significant in the biblical context, symbolizing provision and sustenance. Bread is a staple food in the ancient Near East, and its offering represents a gesture of goodwill and support. The number two may symbolize witness or confirmation, as seen in other scriptural contexts (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This act of giving bread can also be seen as a foreshadowing of God's provision for Saul's kingship, similar to how God provided manna for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>which you will accept from their hands</b><br>Acceptance of the bread signifies Saul's willingness to receive what God has provided through others. It demonstrates humility and acknowledgment of God's provision through human means. This act of acceptance can be seen as a type of Christ, who also received and gave bread, symbolizing His provision for humanity (e.g., the feeding of the 5,000 in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>). Saul's acceptance is a step in his journey of obedience and trust in God's plan for his leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>- The prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.
