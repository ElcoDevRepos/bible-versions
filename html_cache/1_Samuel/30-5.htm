His marriages often had political implications, strengthening alliances and consolidating power. David's two wives mentioned here reflect his personal and political life, which was complex and multifaceted.<p><b>Ahinoam of Jezreel</b><br>Ahinoam is first mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/25-43.htm">1 Samuel 25:43</a>. Jezreel was a city in the territory of Issachar, known for its fertile land. Ahinoam's marriage to David likely had strategic importance, linking him to the northern tribes. Her inclusion in this narrative highlights the personal cost of the Amalekite raid on Ziklag, as David's family was directly affected.<p><b>and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel</b><br>Abigail is introduced in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>, where her wisdom and intervention prevent David from committing bloodshed. Her marriage to David followed the death of her first husband, Nabal, and she is often noted for her intelligence and discernment. Carmel, where Nabal lived, was a region in Judah, indicating David's connections to various parts of Israel. Abigail's presence in David's life is significant, as she is seen as a type of Christ in her role as a peacemaker and intercessor.<p><b>had been taken captive</b><br>The capture of David's wives by the Amalekites was part of a larger raid on Ziklag, as described in <a href="/1_samuel/30.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-2</a>. This event tested David's leadership and faith, as he faced personal loss and the distress of his men. The captivity of his family underscores the vulnerability and challenges David faced before becoming king. This incident also foreshadows the future deliverance and restoration that God would bring, paralleling themes of redemption found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, though not yet reigning, who is leading his men during a time of great personal distress and loss.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahinoam_of_jezreel.htm">Ahinoam of Jezreel</a></b><br>One of David's wives, originally from Jezreel, a city in the territory of Issachar.

Scripture records that Saul gave his daughter Michal to another man (<a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>), so at this moment David&#8217;s household consisted of Ahinoam and Abigail.<p>&#8226; Earlier we read, &#8220;David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-43.htm">1 Samuel 25:43</a>).<p>&#8226; By the time David becomes king in Hebron, these two are still by his side (<a href="/2_samuel/2-2.htm">2 Samuel 2:2</a>).<p>Their mention here reminds us that David&#8217;s leadership decisions affected real families, not just armies and kingdoms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ahinoam of Jezreel</b><p>Ahinoam is the first wife listed. She came from Jezreel in Judah, and nothing negative is said about her in Scripture.<p>&#8226; Her name reappears when David divides the spoil after the victory over the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Her son Amnon will later be David&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>), showing that God will preserve her line despite this crisis.<p>By including Ahinoam&#8217;s name, the Holy Spirit spotlights God&#8217;s concern for each individual, not merely the more famous Abigail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel</b><p>Abigail&#8217;s description recalls her remarkable back-story in <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>.<p>&#8226; She was &#8220;intelligent and beautiful&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>) and acted swiftly to avert bloodshed when her first husband, Nabal, insulted David (v. 18-35).<p>&#8226; After Nabal&#8217;s death, &#8220;David sent word to speak with Abigail...and she became his wife&#8221; (v. 39-42).<p>Mentioning that she was &#8220;the widow of Nabal&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s redemptive turn in her life. Formerly bound to a foolish man, she now shares the trials and triumphs of a future king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had been taken captive</b><p>The Amalekites raided Ziklag while David and his men were away (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;They had attacked Ziklag, burned it, and taken captive the women and all who were in it&#8221; (v. 1-2).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s grief is palpable: &#8220;David and the men with him wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep&#8221; (v. 4).<p>Yet this loss becomes the pivot for one of Scripture&#8217;s greatest turnarounds: &#8220;But David found strength in the LORD his God&#8221; (v. 6). The captivity drives David to seek God, consult the ephod, pursue the raiders, and recover &#8220;everything the Amalekites had taken&#8221; (v. 18-19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-5.htm">1 Samuel 30:5</a> is more than a passing detail; it highlights the personal cost of David&#8217;s wilderness years. By naming Ahinoam and Abigail and stating that they were taken captive, the verse:<p>&#8226; Reminds us that leaders&#8217; families share in their hardships.<p>&#8226; Shows God&#8217;s providence in preserving the very women through whom David&#8217;s family line&#8212;ultimately leading to Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a>)&#8212;will continue.<p>&#8226; Sets the stage for David&#8217;s reliance on the Lord, resulting in complete restoration.<p>The verse therefore calls readers to trust God&#8217;s faithfulness in their own crises, confident that He can turn every captivity into a testimony of His deliverance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
