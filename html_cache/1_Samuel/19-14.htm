This action reflects Saul's spiritual decline and disobedience to God, as he was once chosen by God to be king. The sending of messengers indicates Saul's authority and the seriousness of his intent to capture David. This event occurs in the context of Saul's increasing paranoia and the divine favor shifting from Saul to David, as seen in previous chapters. The messengers represent Saul's attempt to maintain control and eliminate perceived threats to his throne.<p><b>Michal said, &#8220;He is ill.&#8221;</b><br>Michal, David's wife and Saul's daughter, plays a crucial role in protecting David. Her statement that David is ill is a deception intended to buy time for David to escape. This act of loyalty to David over her father highlights the familial and political tensions within Saul's household. Michal's actions can be seen as a fulfillment of her love and commitment to David, as well as a reflection of the divided loyalties that often occur in times of political turmoil. Her deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals use cunning to protect God's chosen, such as Rahab hiding the spies in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<div

Michal intervenes with a risky, quick-thinking reply, &#8220;He is ill,&#8221; delaying the arrest long enough for David to flee. The verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereign protection, the courage required to side with His purposes, and the tragic depths of Saul&#8217;s rebellion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - When, after waiting till the usual hour for David's appearance, he came not, the watchers send and inform Saul, who now orders his open arrest. But Michal despatches a messenger to tell her father that he is sick. Upon this Saul orders bed and all to be brought, that he may slay him. As an Oriental bed is usually a mere strip of carpet, this would be easy enough. But when the messengers force their way through, in spite of every obstruction which Michal can devise to waste time, and come up close to the sleeping figure, "Lo, teraphim in the bed, and a goatskin at its head." They carry the news to Saul, who sends for Michal, and reproaches her for letting his enemy go. And she, afraid of bringing her father's anger upon herself, answers with a falsehood, such as we find David also too readily having resort to; for she tells Saul that his flight was David's own doing, and that she had taken part in it only to save her life. <span class="cmt_word">Why should I kill thee?</span> She pretends that David had told her not to force him to kill her by refusing to give her aid in his escape. Saul, no doubt, saw that she had been a willing agent; but as she professed to have been driven to do what she had done by David's threats, he could say no more.
