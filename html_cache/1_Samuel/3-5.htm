This reflects the cultural importance of honoring elders and leaders in ancient Israel. Samuel's willingness to serve Eli is indicative of his character and foreshadows his future role as a prophet who listens and responds to God's call. The act of running signifies urgency and eagerness, traits that are commendable in a servant of God.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you have called me.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's response, "Here I am," is a phrase often used in Scripture to denote readiness and availability to serve, as seen in the responses of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>). This phrase indicates Samuel's readiness to serve and his attentiveness to Eli's needs. The assumption that Eli called him shows Samuel's trust and the close relationship between the two, as Eli was both his mentor and guardian.<p><b>&#8220;I did not call,&#8221; Eli replied.</b><br>Eli's response indicates a lack of awareness of the divine encounter taking place. This moment highlights Eli's spiritual dullness, a theme that is evident in the preceding chapters where Eli's sons are described as corrupt, and Eli himself is portrayed as failing to restrain them. Eli's inability to recognize God's voice contrasts with Samuel's openness and sets the stage for the transition of spiritual leadership from Eli to Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;Go back and lie down.&#8221;</b><br>Eli's instruction to Samuel to return to bed reflects a practical response, assuming that Samuel was mistaken. This instruction also serves to emphasize the setting of the narrative, which takes place at night, a time often associated with divine revelation in the Bible. The repetition of this command in the subsequent verses underscores the persistence of God's call and the importance of discernment in recognizing God's voice.<p><b>So he went and lay down.</b><br>Samuel's obedience in returning to his place demonstrates his humility and willingness to follow Eli's guidance, even when he does not fully understand the situation. This act of lying down again symbolizes a posture of rest and readiness, preparing Samuel for the continued call of God. It also foreshadows the eventual revelation that will come to Samuel, marking the beginning of his prophetic ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under Eli's guidance.

Though Eli initially misses heaven&#8217;s call, Samuel&#8217;s swift compliance keeps him in position to receive it. The verse invites us to cultivate the same readiness: run toward what we believe is right, present ourselves without reservation, listen carefully, and rest obediently until the LORD speaks again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He ran</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1464;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
