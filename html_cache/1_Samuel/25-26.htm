Abigail addresses David with respect, acknowledging his future kingship. The phrase "as surely as the LORD lives" is a common biblical oath formula, emphasizing God's eternal nature and sovereignty (see <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>). It underscores the belief in God's active presence and involvement in human affairs.<p><b>since the LORD has held you back from bloodshed</b><br>Abigail recognizes God's providential intervention in preventing David from committing unnecessary violence. This reflects the biblical principle that vengeance belongs to the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). David's restraint is seen as a sign of his righteousness and trust in God's justice. The narrative highlights the importance of divine guidance in moral decision-making.<p><b>and from avenging yourself with your own hand</b><br>The cultural context of the time often involved personal retribution, but Abigail's words remind David of a higher moral standard. The restraint from personal vengeance aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, where believers are encouraged to leave justice to God. This moment foreshadows the New Testament ethic of forgiveness and reliance on divine justice.<p><b>may your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal</b><br>Abigail's wish for David's enemies to be like Nabal, whose name means "fool," implies that they would meet a similar fate of divine judgment and disgrace. This reflects the biblical theme of the downfall of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>). Nabal's fate serves as a warning against foolishness and opposition to God's anointed.

Literally, <span class= "ital">As true as that the Lord liveth, so true is it that the Lord hath withholden thee, &c., </span>from coming into blood-guiltiness." So confident is this pious and wise woman that she is doing the Lord's work, and that He is standing by her, that, in presence of the armed band and their angry leader, she speaks as though the danger to her husband's house was a thing of the past, and that David had real cause for thankfulness in that he had been prevented from doing a wanton, wicked act.<p><span class= "bld">Now let thine enemies . . . be as Nabal.</span>--Nabal, the insulter of David, she dismisses as too insignificant to be considered; she regards him as utterly powerless to harm one like David; and her prayer is that his other enemies may only be like him--equally harmless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - Abigail begins her appeal by affirming that it was Jehovah who thus made her come to prevent bloodshed; she next propitiates David with the prayer that his enemies may be as Nabal, insignificant fools; and finally asks him to accept her present, not for himself, - that would be too great an honour, - but as good enough only for his followers. The first of these affirmations is obscured by the rendering in the A.V., and should be translated, "And now, my lord (an ordinary title of respect, like our <span class="accented">sir</span>), as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, so true is it that Jehovah hath withholden thee from blood guiltiness, and from saving thyself with thine own hand; and now let thine enemies," etc. The same words recur in vers. 31, 33. <span class="cmt_word">Blessing</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> gift, present (see <a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>). This beautiful term shows the deep religiousness of the Hebrew mind. The gift is something that comes not from the donor, but from God, in answer to the donor's prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
