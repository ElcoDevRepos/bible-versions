Saul, Jonathan's father, is the king of Israel, and David is a favored servant who has become a threat to Saul due to his popularity and God's favor. The phrase implies a test of Saul's intentions towards David. In the cultural context, missing someone at a royal feast would be noticeable, especially if that person held a significant position. This reflects the tension and suspicion in Saul's court.<p><b>tell him, &#8216;David urgently requested my permission</b><br>David and Jonathan devise a plan to gauge Saul's feelings towards David. The urgency in David's request suggests a matter of great importance, highlighting the seriousness of the situation. In the historical context, seeking permission from a superior or a friend in authority was customary, showing respect and maintaining social order. This also reflects the trust and friendship between Jonathan and David.<p><b>to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the City of David, is significant in biblical history. It is the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah's lineage. Geographically, Bethlehem is a small town in Judah, emphasizing David's humble beginnings. The mention of his hometown underscores his roots and connection to his family and heritage.<p><b>because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan</b><br>The annual sacrifice indicates a religious and familial obligation, common in Israelite culture. Such sacrifices were times of communal gathering and worship, reflecting the importance of family and religious duties. This provides a plausible reason for David's absence, as attending such events was customary. The mention of the clan highlights the tribal structure of Israelite society, where family and clan ties were paramount. This also foreshadows the sacrificial system fulfilled in Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

Similar earnest petitions appear in Nehemiah&#8217;s request to Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s appeal to Jonathan, rather than a direct approach to Saul, reflects the rupture in David-Saul relations while preserving decorum.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown</b><p>&#8226; Bethlehem is repeatedly identified as &#8220;the city of David&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).

"In the then disorganised condition of public worship to which David first gave regular form, family usages of this sort, after the manner of other nations, had established themselves, which were contrary to the (Mosaic) prescriptions concerning the unity of Divine worship."--O. von Gerlach, in <span class= "ital">Lange. </span>It is highly probable that the festival in question was at this time being held at Bethlehem. It is, however, clear that David did not purpose being present at it, and therefore the excuse was a feigned one.
