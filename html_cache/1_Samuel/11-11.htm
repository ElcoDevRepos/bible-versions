This reflects the military strategies seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as Gideon's division of his men in <a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>. The number three often symbolizes completeness and divine perfection in the Bible, suggesting that Saul's plan was divinely inspired. This moment marks Saul's first major military campaign as king, highlighting his role as a leader chosen by God.<p><b>and during the morning watch they invaded the camp of the Ammonites</b><br>The morning watch refers to the last third of the night, from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., a time when enemies would be least prepared for an attack. This strategic timing shows Saul's wisdom and understanding of warfare. The Ammonites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), were long-standing enemies of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. This invasion signifies a turning point where Israel begins to assert itself against its oppressors.<p><b>and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of the day</b><br>The phrase indicates a complete and overwhelming victory for Saul and the Israelites. The battle lasting until the hottest part of the day suggests both the intensity and the thoroughness of the conflict. This victory can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from their enemies, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death.<p><b>And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together</b><br>This scattering of the Ammonites signifies a total rout, emphasizing the completeness of Israel's victory. It reflects the biblical theme of God scattering His enemies, as seen in <a href="/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68:1</a>. The disarray among the Ammonites can be seen as a divine intervention, ensuring that they could not regroup or pose a future threat.
