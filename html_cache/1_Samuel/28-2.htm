At this point, David is living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit. His statement is intentionally ambiguous, allowing him to maintain his loyalty to Israel while appearing to serve Achish. This duality in David's actions is a recurring theme in his life, showcasing his wisdom and ability to navigate complex political situations. The phrase "your servant" is significant, as it reflects David's humility and willingness to serve, a characteristic that aligns with his later role as a servant-leader in Israel. This moment foreshadows David's future as a king who is both a warrior and a diplomat.<p><b>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Achish.</b><br>Achish's response indicates his trust in David, which is remarkable given the historical enmity between the Israelites and the Philistines. This trust may have been built over time, as David had been living in Philistine territory and conducting raids that he claimed were against Israelite enemies. Achish's acceptance of David suggests a level of desperation or political calculation, as having a warrior like David on his side would be advantageous. This interaction highlights the complex relationships between neighboring nations in the ancient Near East, where alliances were often formed out of necessity rather than genuine friendship.<p><b>&#8220;I will make you my bodyguard for life.&#8221;</b><br>Achish's offer to make David his bodyguard is significant, as it implies a position of great trust and honor. In ancient times, a bodyguard was not only responsible for the physical protection of a leader but also served as a close advisor and confidant. This role would have given David access to Philistine military strategies and political plans, which could be advantageous for Israel. The phrase "for life" suggests a permanent arrangement, indicating Achish's confidence in David's loyalty. This situation is ironic, as David, the future king of Israel, is being positioned as a protector of a Philistine king. This role can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though rejected by His own, serves as the protector and savior of all who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who has given refuge to David and his men.

Achish, deceived by David&#8217;s earlier actions, entrusts him with the role of lifelong bodyguard. The verse underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: even Philistine plans serve His purpose of safeguarding the future king of Israel until the right moment of deliverance arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And David said to Achish.</span>--Sorely perplexed, David temporises.

(See <a href="/1_samuel/29-3.htm" title="Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?

It is also quite conceivable, too, that whispers respecting David s expeditions during the past year were current in some Philistine quarters. The eyes of the king, thought these more far-seeing nobles, were blinded by his partiality for his military vassal. (See Note on <a href="/1_samuel/29-3.htm" title="Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?
