The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles with them. The phrase suggests that God has withdrawn His protection from Israel due to Saul's disobedience and rejection of God's commands, as seen earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>. The Philistines, known for their military prowess and iron weaponry, were formidable adversaries. This judgment reflects the consequences of Saul's failure to fully obey God, as seen in his incomplete destruction of the Amalekites and his unlawful sacrifice.<p><b>and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me</b><br>This prophecy foretells the imminent death of Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, who was a close friend of David. The phrase "with me" is spoken by the spirit of Samuel, indicating that Saul and his sons will join him in the realm of the dead. This reflects the Hebrew understanding of Sheol, the abode of the dead, where both the righteous and unrighteous reside. The mention of "tomorrow" underscores the immediacy of the prophecy, highlighting the urgency and certainty of God's judgment. This also serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's guidance.<p><b>And the LORD will deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines</b><br>This reiterates the earlier part of the prophecy, emphasizing the totality of Israel's defeat. The army of Israel, once victorious under leaders like Joshua and Gideon, will now face defeat due to the nation's and its king's disobedience. This serves as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant. The defeat also sets the stage for David's eventual rise to kingship, as Saul's downfall clears the way for God's chosen leader to ascend. This transition is part of God's sovereign plan, demonstrating His control over the nations and His faithfulness to His promises, despite human failure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is seeking guidance from the prophet Samuel through a medium, as God has stopped answering him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The deceased prophet who is summoned by the medium at Endor to deliver a message to Saul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel, who are preparing to battle against Saul and his army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>The location where Saul visits a medium to summon the spirit of Samuel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan_and_saul's_sons.htm">Jonathan and Saul's Sons</a></b><br>Saul's sons, including Jonathan, who are prophesied to die in the upcoming battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's life is a cautionary tale of how disobedience to God leads to dire consequences.

(c) The sacking of the Israelitish camp, which was to follow the defeat, and which would terribly augment the horrors and disasters of the rout of the king's army.<p>"This overthrow of the people was to heighten Saul's misery, when he saw the people plunged with him into ruin through his sin."--<span class= "ital">O. von Gerlach.</span><p><span class= "bld">To morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.</span>--The Hebrew word here rendered "to morrow," <span class= "ital">machar, </span>need not signify "the next day," but some near future time. In saying "thou shalt be with me," Samuel does not pronounce Saul's final condemnation, for he had no mission to do so, but rather draws him by his tenderness to a better mind. He uses a mild and charitable expression, applicable to all, good and bad, "Thou shalt be as I am: no longer among the living." In the vision of the world of spirits, revealed to us by our blessed Lord, the souls of Dives and Lazarus may be said to be together in the abode of the departed spirits, for Dives saw Lazarus, and conversed with Abraham, though there was a gulf fixed between them. "If Samuel had said to Saul, 'Thou shalt be among the damned,' he would have crushed him with a weight of despair, and have hardened him in his impenitence; but by using this gentler expression, he mildly exhorted him to repentance. While there was life there was hope: the door was still open."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p>"Shalt thou be with me" does not refer to an equality in bliss, but to a like condition of death.--<span class= "ital">St. Augustine. </span>Augustine here means that to-morrow Saul would be "a shade," like to what Samuel then was;
