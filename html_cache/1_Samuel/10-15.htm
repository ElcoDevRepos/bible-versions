In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family ties were strong, and communication within the family was expected. The request implies a level of curiosity or concern, which is common in familial relationships.<p><b>Saul&#8217;s uncle asked,</b><br>Saul's uncle is not named here, but he is part of Saul's family, which was from the tribe of Benjamin. The tribe of Benjamin was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and its history includes the near destruction of the tribe in the events of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. This background adds depth to the family dynamics and the significance of Saul's rise to kingship. The uncle's inquiry may reflect the family's interest in Saul's interactions with Samuel, a prominent prophet and judge in Israel.<p><b>&#8220;what did Samuel say to you?&#8221;</b><br>Samuel was a significant figure in Israel, serving as a prophet, priest, and judge. His words carried weight and authority, as he was seen as God's spokesperson. The question reflects the expectation that Samuel's communication would be important, possibly containing divine guidance or prophecy. This moment follows Samuel's anointing of Saul as the first king of Israel, a pivotal event in Israel's history. The inquiry may also hint at the anticipation of change in Israel's leadership structure, transitioning from judges to a monarchy. Samuel's role as a prophet is echoed in other scriptures, such as his anointing of David in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, and his life is a type of Christ as a mediator between God and the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel. At this point in the account, Saul is still a young man, not yet fully aware of the significant role he will play in Israel's history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul's_uncle.htm">Saul's Uncle</a></b><br>A relative of Saul who inquires about Saul's recent activities. His question sets the stage for Saul to reveal his encounter with Samuel, though Saul chooses to withhold the full details.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy. Samuel anoints Saul as king, acting on God's instructions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_donkeys.htm">The Donkeys</a></b><br>The lost donkeys serve as a catalyst for Saul's journey, leading him to Samuel. This seemingly mundane event is used by God to bring about His divine plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>The place where Samuel resides and where Saul goes to seek guidance.

The uncle wants facts, not rumors.<p>- Scripture often shows godly concern expressed with the same simple plea:<p>&#8226; Eli to young Samuel&#8212;&#8220;What is the word that He spoke to you? Do not hide it from me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob to Joseph&#8212;&#8220;Go now, see about the welfare of your brothers&#8230;and bring word back to me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>).<p>- Such requests underscore the biblical value of truthfulness (<a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>) and accountability within family lines (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul&#8217;s uncle asked,</b><p>- The speaker is likely Abner, son of Ner (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>), a respected military man. His question carries weight.<p>- By noting that it is an &#8220;uncle&#8221; who asks, the text highlights:<p>&#8226; Family oversight: elders keeping the younger generation grounded (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Public interest: Saul&#8217;s encounter with the prophet has wider significance for Israel&#8217;s future leadership (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>).<p>- Asking, rather than ordering, shows relational concern, echoing Paul&#8217;s appeal to Philemon &#8220;yet for love&#8217;s sake I rather appeal to you&#8221; (Philemon 9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;what did Samuel say to you?&#8221;</b><p>- Samuel&#8217;s words carry prophetic authority; people instinctively want to know God&#8217;s message (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>- The uncle&#8217;s focus is not on the lost donkeys but on divine revelation&#8212;he senses something weighty occurred.<p>- Saul&#8217;s guarded reply in the next verse (&#8220;He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found,&#8221; v. 16) reveals:<p>&#8226; Humility&#8212;he withholds news of the anointing until God brings it to light publicly (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>).<p>&#8226; A test of obedience&#8212;like Mary later &#8220;treasuring up all these things&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>), Saul waits for God&#8217;s timing.<p>- Cross-echo: when Elisha&#8217;s servant returned, King Ben-hadad asked, &#8220;What did Elisha tell you?&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a>). Hearing the word of the LORD is always pivotal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-15.htm">1 Samuel 10:15</a> captures a moment of family inquiry that spotlights Israel&#8217;s hunger for God&#8217;s voice, the importance of honest testimony, and Saul&#8217;s initial restraint. The verse shows a godly pattern: loved ones pressing for truth, prophetic words valued above ordinary news, and God&#8217;s chosen servant learning to wait for the right time to reveal His plans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Tell me,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
