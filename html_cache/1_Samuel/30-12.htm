Figs and raisins are mentioned frequently in the Bible as symbols of provision and abundance (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/16.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>). The offering of these foods to the Egyptian servant by David's men signifies an act of mercy and hospitality, reflecting the biblical principle of caring for the needy (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>). This act also prefigures the provision of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, offering spiritual sustenance to those in need (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>So he ate and was revived</b><br>The physical revival of the Egyptian servant after eating symbolizes spiritual renewal and restoration. In biblical terms, eating often represents receiving life-giving sustenance, akin to how believers are spiritually nourished by the Word of God (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>). This revival can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual awakening that occurs when one encounters the grace and provision of God. It also echoes the resurrection theme, where life is restored through divine intervention, pointing to the ultimate resurrection through Christ (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><b>for he had not had any food or water for three days and three nights</b><br>The mention of "three days and three nights" is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing a period of trial or testing followed by deliverance or resurrection. This time frame is notably paralleled in the story of Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The servant's lack of sustenance for this period highlights his dire condition and the miraculous nature of his revival, underscoring themes of redemption and divine intervention. This phrase also emphasizes the importance of compassion and timely aid, as demonstrated by David's men, reflecting God's call to care for the vulnerable and oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is leading his men in pursuit of the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_servant.htm">The Egyptian Servant</a></b><br>A young man found in the field, abandoned by his Amalekite master because he fell ill.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town given to David by the Philistine king Achish, which was raided and burned by the Amalekites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that attacked Ziklag, taking captives and plundering the town.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David's Men</a></b><br>The group of warriors loyal to David, who are with him in pursuit of the Amalekites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>David's men demonstrate compassion by providing for the Egyptian servant's physical needs, reminding us of the importance of mercy and kindness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revival_through_provision.htm">Revival through Provision</a></b><br>The physical revival of the Egyptian servant after receiving food and water illustrates how meeting basic needs can lead to restoration and strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty in Circumstances</a></b><br>The encounter with the Egyptian servant was providential, showing how God can use unexpected situations to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_generosity.htm">The Power of Generosity</a></b><br>The act of giving, even to a stranger or enemy, can lead to unexpected blessings and alliances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>True faith is demonstrated through tangible acts of kindness and provision for those in need.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_30_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 30:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_30_12_Kindness_to_strangers.htm">How does 1 Samuel 30:12 demonstrate the importance of showing kindness to strangers?
