Knowing someone's father often provided insight into their social standing, tribe, and potential alliances. This request by the king reflects the cultural emphasis on genealogy, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the genealogies of Genesis and the detailed records in Chronicles. It also highlights the importance of family identity in understanding one's role and future within the community.<p><b>this young man</b><br>The phrase "young man" refers to David, who at this point in the narrative has just defeated Goliath. David's youth is significant, as it underscores the miraculous nature of his victory over the seasoned warrior Goliath. This victory is a testament to God's power working through the seemingly weak and insignificant, a theme echoed in other biblical narratives, such as Gideon's victory over the Midianites (Judges 7). David's youth also foreshadows his future as a young king chosen by God, reminiscent of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>is!</b><br>The exclamation point indicates the king's urgency and curiosity. This reflects the unexpected nature of David's triumph and the king's immediate interest in understanding more about him. The king's reaction can be seen as a turning point in David's life, marking the beginning of his rise to prominence in Israel.<p><b>said the king.</b><br>The king in this context is Saul, the first king of Israel. Saul's inquiry about David's lineage is significant because it marks the beginning of a complex relationship between Saul and David. Saul's initial interest in David eventually turns to jealousy and fear as David's popularity and success grow. This dynamic is a critical element in the narrative of 1 Samuel, illustrating the themes of divine favor, human jealousy, and the transition of leadership from Saul to David. Saul's reign and his interactions with David also serve as a backdrop for understanding the establishment of the Davidic covenant, which is central to the messianic prophecies fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_saul.htm">King Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Rewards promised by Saul include tax-free status &#8220;for his father&#8217;s house&#8221; (17:25), so the king needs the father&#8217;s name to honor that pledge.<p>&#8226; Knowing David&#8217;s father will anchor David in Israel&#8217;s tribal structure (<a href="/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often ties identity to parentage&#8212;think of Jonathan &#8220;son of Saul&#8221; (14:1) or Jesus called &#8220;Son of David&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this young man is!</b><p>&#8226; David is repeatedly called &#8220;young&#8221; (17:14, 33), highlighting God&#8217;s pattern of using what seems weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The exclamation point underscores Saul&#8217;s amazement: a shepherd-boy just felled Goliath (17:50).<p>&#8226; God sees potential where humans see inexperience&#8212;mirrored later when Jeremiah protests, &#8220;I am only a youth&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said the king</b><p>&#8226; As monarch, Saul&#8217;s words carry legal authority; the court must obey (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes Saul&#8217;s superficial knowledge of David even after David had served as his harpist (16:21). His spiritual dullness contrasts with Jonathan&#8217;s immediate affection for David (18:1).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s inquiry foreshadows the tension that will grow between Saul&#8217;s throne and David&#8217;s destiny (18:8&#8211;9; 24:20).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s question is not idle curiosity. He urgently seeks the hero&#8217;s lineage so he can honor royal promises, integrate David into national life, and assess potential threat to his throne. In spotlighting David&#8217;s youth, the verse magnifies God&#8217;s power to exalt the humble and sets the stage for the unfolding drama between Israel&#8217;s first king and the shepherd who will become &#8220;a man after God&#8217;s own heart&#8221;
