Pride is often the root of rebellion against God, as seen in the fall of Lucifer (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>) and the downfall of humanity in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). The Bible consistently teaches that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). In the context of 1 Samuel, Hannah's prayer contrasts her humility with the pride of those who oppose God, such as the house of Eli, whose sons were corrupt and arrogant (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>).<p><b>or let arrogance come from your mouth</b><br>Arrogance is often expressed through speech, revealing the condition of the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The Bible emphasizes the power of words and the importance of controlling one's tongue (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). In ancient Israel, boasting was not only a personal vice but also a societal issue, as leaders and nations often boasted of their strength and achievements, forgetting their dependence on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>). This warning serves as a reminder to acknowledge God's sovereignty and to speak with humility.<p><b>for the LORD is a God who knows</b><br>This phrase highlights God's omniscience, a fundamental attribute of His nature. God&#8217;s knowledge is perfect and complete, encompassing all things past, present, and future (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). In the historical context of 1 Samuel, this truth reassures the faithful that God is aware of their circumstances and the injustices they face. It also serves as a warning to those who act wickedly, as nothing is hidden from God's sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>and by Him actions are weighed</b><br>God's role as the ultimate judge is emphasized here. He evaluates not only the actions themselves but also the motives behind them (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). This concept of divine justice is central to the biblical narrative, where God consistently rewards righteousness and punishes wickedness (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>). In the broader context of 1 Samuel, this principle foreshadows the eventual judgment and downfall of Eli's house due to their unrepentant sin (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11-14</a>). It also points to the ultimate judgment through Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>The mother of Samuel, who offers this prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God after dedicating her son to the Lord's service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is characterized in this verse as omniscient and just, weighing the deeds of individuals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom this message is directed, serving as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_pride_and_arrogance.htm">Avoiding Pride and Arrogance</a></b><br>Pride is a sin that distances us from God.
