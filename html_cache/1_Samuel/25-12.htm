The cultural expectation was that Nabal would reciprocate David's protection of his shepherds and flocks. However, Nabal's refusal was a significant breach of hospitality norms in ancient Israel. The phrase indicates the obedience and discipline of David's men, who did not retaliate against Nabal's insult but instead returned to David. This reflects the military and social structure of David's followers, who were loyal and acted under his command.<p><b>and they relayed to him all these words</b><br>The men faithfully reported Nabal's insulting response to David. This act of communication is crucial in the narrative, as it sets the stage for David's initial reaction of anger and his decision to seek vengeance. The phrase highlights the importance of accurate communication and the role of messengers in biblical narratives. It also underscores the tension between David's human impulse for retribution and the divine call for justice and mercy, a theme that resonates throughout the scriptures. This moment foreshadows the intervention of Abigail, Nabal's wise and discerning wife, who will later prevent bloodshed and demonstrate God's providential care over David's future kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently leading a group of men while on the run from King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David&#8217;s Men</a></b><br>Loyal followers of David who serve as his messengers and soldiers during his time in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but foolish man who refuses to provide hospitality to David and his men, despite their protection of his shepherds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>Nabal&#8217;s wise and discerning wife, who later intervenes to prevent David from taking vengeance on Nabal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_paran.htm">Wilderness of Paran</a></b><br>The region where David and his men are staying, a place of refuge and survival during David&#8217;s flight from Saul.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wise_counsel.htm">The Importance of Wise Counsel</a></b><br>David&#8217;s initial reaction to Nabal&#8217;s insult is one of anger and a desire for revenge.
