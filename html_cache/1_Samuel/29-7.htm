At this point in the narrative, David has been living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit. The Philistines are preparing for battle against Israel, and David, along with his men, is expected to join them. However, the Philistine commanders distrust David, fearing he might turn against them in battle. The command to "turn back" signifies a pivotal moment where David is spared from fighting against his own people, Israel. This reflects God's providential care over David, ensuring he remains aligned with his future role as king of Israel.<p><b>and go in peace</b><br>Achish's instruction for David to "go in peace" is significant, as it underscores the peaceful resolution of a potentially dangerous situation. Despite the tension, David is sent away without conflict, highlighting the theme of divine intervention and protection. The phrase "go in peace" is often used in Scripture to denote a blessing or a safe departure, as seen in other instances such as in <a href="/genesis/26-29.htm">Genesis 26:29</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a>. It reflects a desire for well-being and safety, which is consistent with God's overarching plan for David's life.<p><b>so that you will not do anything to displease</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the concern of the Philistine leaders that David might act against their interests. The Philistines remember David's reputation as a formidable warrior, particularly his victory over Goliath, a Philistine champion. Their fear is that David might seize the opportunity to regain favor with Saul by turning against them during the battle. This highlights the tension between David's past as an Israelite hero and his current position among the Philistines. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of loyalty and the potential for divided allegiances.<p><b>the leaders of the Philistines.</b><br>The Philistine leaders, or "lords," were the rulers of the five major Philistine cities: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza. These leaders were influential and held significant power in the region. Their decision to exclude David from the battle underscores their authority and the political dynamics at play. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, and their interactions with David provide insight into the complex relationships between neighboring nations. This situation also foreshadows David's future as a king who will eventually subdue the Philistines, fulfilling God's promise to deliver Israel from its enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who at this time is living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The Philistine king of Gath who trusts David and wants him to fight alongside the Philistines against Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_leaders.htm">Philistine Leaders</a></b><br>The commanders of the Philistine army who distrust David and fear he might turn against them in battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_camp.htm">Philistine Camp</a></b><br>The location where the Philistine army is gathered to prepare for battle against Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whom David is anointed to lead, but currently finds himself in a complex situation due to his alliance with the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even when circumstances seem dire or confusing, like David's situation among the Philistines, trust that God is in control and working behind the scenes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection.htm">God's Protection</a></b><br>David's dismissal from the battle is a divine intervention that prevents him from fighting against his own people, illustrating God's protective hand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_complex_situations.htm">Integrity in Complex Situations</a></b><br>David's life among the Philistines teaches us the importance of maintaining integrity and faithfulness to God, even when surrounded by those who do not share our beliefs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing.htm">God's Timing</a></b><br>David's journey reminds us that God's timing is perfect.
