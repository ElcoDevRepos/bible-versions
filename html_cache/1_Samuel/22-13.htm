His reign began with promise but was marred by disobedience to God, leading to his eventual rejection as king. This question is directed at Ahimelech the priest, reflecting Saul's growing paranoia and instability. Saul's inquiry is accusatory, indicating his suspicion and fear of losing power.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me?</b><br>The "son of Jesse" refers to David, who was anointed by Samuel to be the next king of Israel. Saul's use of "son of Jesse" instead of David's name may indicate disdain or an attempt to depersonalize David. The accusation of conspiracy highlights Saul's belief that David is actively seeking to overthrow him, despite David's loyalty. This reflects Saul's increasing paranoia and the tension between Saul and David, which is a central theme in 1 Samuel.<p><b>You gave him bread and a sword</b><br>Ahimelech provided David with the showbread and the sword of Goliath when David fled from Saul. This act of kindness was interpreted by Saul as an act of treason. The bread symbolizes sustenance and the sword represents protection, both of which were seen as enabling David to continue evading Saul. This incident is recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21</a>, where David deceives Ahimelech by not revealing his true situation.<p><b>and inquired of God for him</b><br>Ahimelech's inquiry of God for David suggests seeking divine guidance or blessing, which was a common practice for priests. Saul interprets this as a religious endorsement of David's actions. This reflects the role of priests as intermediaries between God and the people, and Saul's perception that Ahimelech's actions were supportive of David's supposed rebellion.<p><b>so that he could rise up against me</b><br>Saul's fear is that David is gathering strength and support to challenge his kingship. This phrase indicates Saul's belief that David's actions are part of a larger plot to usurp the throne. Historically, this reflects the political instability and the threat Saul felt from David's growing popularity and success.<p><b>to lie in wait, as he is doing today.&#8221;</b><br>Saul accuses David of actively plotting against him, portraying David as a threat to his reign. This accusation is unfounded, as David consistently shows restraint and respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed. The phrase "as he is doing today" suggests Saul's immediate concern and the urgency he feels in addressing what he perceives as a direct threat. This reflects the ongoing conflict and tension between Saul and David, which is a significant narrative in the books of Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly paranoid and sees David as a threat to his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (Son of Jesse)</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be the next king of Israel, currently fleeing from Saul's attempts to kill him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a></b><br>The priest who unknowingly aids David by giving him bread and a sword, and inquiring of God for him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>The city of priests where Ahimelech resides and where David receives help.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/conspiracy.htm">Conspiracy</a></b><br>Saul accuses Ahimelech and David of conspiring against him, reflecting his growing paranoia and detachment from God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_paranoia_and_fear.htm">The Dangers of Paranoia and Fear</a></b><br>Saul's fear leads him to see enemies where there are none, causing harm to innocent people.
