The spear in Saul's hand is symbolic of his kingship and military prowess, yet it also foreshadows his violent intentions. The spear is a recurring motif in Saul's interactions with David, representing his growing paranoia and hostility. Historically, the spear was a common weapon and symbol of leadership in ancient Near Eastern cultures, emphasizing Saul's role as a warrior king.<p><b>a spirit of distress from the LORD came upon him</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine involvement in Saul's mental and emotional state. The "spirit of distress" suggests a supernatural influence that causes turmoil, reflecting God's judgment on Saul for his disobedience. This aligns with earlier passages where Saul's rejection by God leads to his spiritual and psychological decline. Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God in using even distressing circumstances to fulfill His purposes. This spirit contrasts with the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in David's life, illustrating the divergent paths of the two men.<p><b>While David was playing the harp</b><br>David's role as a musician in Saul's court is significant, as music was believed to have therapeutic effects in ancient cultures. David's harp playing is intended to soothe Saul's troubled spirit, showcasing David's talents and his initial role as a servant to the king. This moment also foreshadows David's future as a leader who brings peace and order. Theologically, David's music can be seen as a precursor to his role as a psalmist, whose compositions would become central to Israel's worship. This scene also highlights the contrast between Saul's inner turmoil and David's God-given peace and skill.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

His throne room is now a living room, revealing how personal sin shrinks a king&#8217;s world. The same Saul who once &#8220;gathered all Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>) now isolates himself, stewing over David&#8217;s rising favor (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6&#8211;9</a>). In Scripture, isolation often accompanies spiritual decline&#8212;think of Cain leaving the presence of the Lord (<a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>) or Elijah fleeing in despair (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3&#8211;4</a>). Saul&#8217;s choice of setting signals inward collapse before any outward violence erupts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with his spear in his hand</b><p>The spear has become Saul&#8217;s dark companion&#8212;first seen in the royal tent (<a href="/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>), later thrust at Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-33.htm">1 Samuel 20:33</a>). It symbolizes:<p>&#8226; Hostility toward God&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>).<p>&#8226; A false sense of control; Saul grips steel because he has lost spiritual grip.<p>&#8226; Readiness to damage rather than defend. By contrast, David will later refuse to raise Saul&#8217;s own spear against him (<a href="/1_samuel/26-11.htm">1 Samuel 26:11&#8211;12</a>), embodying trust in God&#8217;s timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a spirit of distress from the LORD came upon him</b><p>God remains sovereign even over judgment. As earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>, the Lord removes His favor and allows a tormenting spirit to magnify Saul&#8217;s inner rebellion (compare <a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>). The phrase does not blame God for evil but affirms His right to use even dark agents to accomplish holy purposes (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19&#8211;23</a>). Saul&#8217;s affliction testifies that rejecting God&#8217;s Spirit invites spiritual oppression (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>). The episode confronts us with the seriousness of sin: divine patience has limits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>While David was playing the harp</b><p>God provides grace amid judgment. David&#8217;s music had previously soothed Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>), foreshadowing how Messiah&#8217;s presence calms troubled hearts (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). Yet the same melody now becomes background to murderous intent, showing that hardened hearts can turn a blessing into provocation (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15&#8211;16</a>). David&#8217;s faithful service under threat models:<p>&#8226; Obedience in hostile workplaces (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Overcoming evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Trusting God to vindicate rather than seizing self-defense (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9</a> pictures a tragic collision: a king clutches a spear, gripped by jealousy, while God&#8217;s chosen servant strums healing notes. Saul&#8217;s self-chosen isolation and violence invite divine discipline in the form of a distressing spirit. Yet God simultaneously offers mercy through David&#8217;s music. The verse warns that rejecting God&#8217;s rule leads to inner torment and outward aggression, while also highlighting the quiet power of faithfulness to shine in the darkest rooms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And the evil spirit . . . was upon Saul.</span>--Again the terrible malady was upon the king--not unlikely brought on by the wild storm of jealous fury which Saul allowed to sweep unchecked across his soul.
