The concept of a guilt offering, or trespass offering, is rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-19</a>), where it was used to atone for unintentional sins and offenses against God. The Philistines, though pagans, recognized the need to make amends for their transgression against the God of Israel, showing an understanding of divine retribution and the necessity of atonement.<p><b>&#8220;Five gold tumors and five gold rats,&#8221; they said,</b><br>The choice of gold tumors and rats as offerings directly correlates to the plagues that afflicted the Philistines. The tumors likely refer to the physical afflictions described in <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6-12</a>, while the rats may symbolize the destruction of their land, possibly through disease or famine. Gold, a precious metal, signifies the value and seriousness of the offering. This act reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of creating votive offerings that represent the affliction or sin being atoned for.<p><b>&#8220;according to the number of rulers of the Philistines,&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines were organized into a pentapolis, consisting of five major city-states: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. Each city was governed by a ruler or lord. The offering of five gold tumors and five gold rats corresponds to these five rulers, indicating a collective acknowledgment of guilt and a unified attempt to seek relief from the divine punishment affecting all their territories.<p><b>&#8220;since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.&#8221;</b><br>The plagues affected not only the common people but also the rulers, emphasizing the widespread nature of the divine judgment. This mirrors the biblical theme that God's judgment is impartial and affects all levels of society, as seen in other instances of divine retribution (e.g., the plagues of Egypt in <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>). The acknowledgment of shared suffering underscores the Philistines' recognition of the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel, compelling them to seek reconciliation through the prescribed guilt offering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were adversaries of Israel and had captured the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/five_philistine_rulers.htm">Five Philistine Rulers</a></b><br>Leaders of the five principal cities of the Philistines&#8212;Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_tumors_and_rats.htm">Gold Tumors and Rats</a></b><br>Objects made by the Philistines as a guilt offering to God, symbolizing the plagues that afflicted them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment that struck the Philistines, causing them to seek a way to appease the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_guilt_offerings.htm">Understanding Guilt Offerings</a></b><br>The Philistines recognized their need to make amends for offending the God of Israel.

Though they do not possess the Law, they grasp one of its core ideas: a guilt offering is meant to acknowledge sin and seek release from divine wrath (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-19</a>; 7:1-7).<p>&#8226; They ask, &#8220;What guilt offering&#8230;?&#8221;&#8212;showing that they want direction, not mere guesswork.<p>&#8226; The question also signals surrender: the Ark will go back, and some token of atonement must go with it (<a href="/1_samuel/6-8.htm">1 Samuel 6:8</a>).<p>Their inquiry illustrates an important principle: when confronted by God&#8217;s holiness, even pagans instinctively know restitution is required (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five gold tumors and five gold rats</b><p>Their priests recommend images of the very things that plagued them&#8212;tumors on their bodies and rats overrunning their land (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>; 5:11).<p>&#8226; Gold turns symbols of shame into costly acknowledgments of God&#8217;s power.<p>&#8226; By sending replicas of the afflictions, they confess, &#8220;These came from Your hand; only You can remove them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The strategy echoes <a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>, where a bronze serpent depicted the judgment yet became the means of healing.<p>The choice of gold further underlines that nothing less than their best is suitable for the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the number of rulers of the Philistines</b><p>Five major city-states&#8212;Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, Ekron&#8212;each ruled by a &#8220;lord&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; One gold tumor + one gold rat for each city = total representation.<p>&#8226; Corporate guilt calls for corporate confession; none can opt out (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors Israel&#8217;s own tribal offerings in <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>, where every leader brings an identical gift before the LORD.<p>The Philistines unwittingly follow a biblical pattern: measured, representative offerings that confess shared responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers</b><p>Judgment was democratic: ordinary people and leaders alike suffered (<a href="/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God shows no partiality (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; When rulers sin, the people suffer; when people sin, leaders are not exempt (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The equal scope of the plague justifies equal participation in the offering.<p>Acknowledging the shared nature of the punishment is the first step toward shared relief (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a> records a pagan nation wrestling with Israel&#8217;s holy God.

Their actions, though imperfect, affirm the unchanging principle that genuine acknowledgment of guilt accompanied by costly, representative submission opens the door for God&#8217;s mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Five golden emerods, and five golden mice.</span>--It was a general custom in the nations of antiquity to offer to the deity, to whom sickness or recovery from sickness was ascribed, likenesses of the diseased parts; so, too, those who had escaped from shipwreck would offer pictures, or perhaps their garments, to Neptune, or, as some tell us, to Isis. (See, for instance, Horace, <span class= "ital">Carm. i.</span> 5.) Slaves and gladiators would present their arms to Hercules; captives would dedicate their chains to some deity. This practice has found favour in more modern times. In the fifth century Christians--Theodoret tells us--would often offer in their churches gold or silver hands and feet, or eyes, as a thank-offering for cures effected in reply to prayer.
