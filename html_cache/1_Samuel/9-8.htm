Servants in ancient Israel often played significant roles in the lives of their masters, sometimes offering wisdom and guidance. This reflects the cultural norm where servants were trusted members of the household, often involved in important decisions. The servant's response indicates a level of respect and understanding of the situation, suggesting that he is not merely a passive observer but an active participant in seeking divine guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said,</b><br>The word "Look" is an invitation to pay attention, emphasizing the importance of what follows. It suggests urgency and the need for Saul to consider the servant's proposal seriously. This moment highlights the servant's role in redirecting Saul's focus, which is crucial in the unfolding narrative of Saul's anointing as king.<p><b>&#8220;I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver.</b><br>The quarter shekel of silver represents a small but significant amount of money, indicating the servant's preparedness and willingness to contribute to the cause. In the ancient Near East, silver was a common medium of exchange, and this specific amount suggests a modest offering, yet sufficient for the purpose at hand. This reflects the cultural practice of bringing a gift or offering when seeking the counsel of a prophet or man of God, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>).<p><b>I will give it to the man of God,</b><br>The term "man of God" is used to describe a prophet or someone who speaks on behalf of God. In this context, it refers to Samuel, who is recognized as a prophet and judge in Israel. The act of giving a gift to a prophet was customary, acknowledging the prophet's role and the value of divine guidance. This practice underscores the respect and honor given to those who served as intermediaries between God and His people.<p><b>and he will tell us our way.&#8221;</b><br>The expectation that the man of God will provide direction highlights the belief in divine guidance through prophets. This reflects the historical context where prophets were sought for counsel on various matters, both personal and national. The phrase "tell us our way" indicates a desire for specific guidance, which in this narrative, foreshadows Saul's eventual anointing as king. This reliance on prophetic insight is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's will through His appointed messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys.
