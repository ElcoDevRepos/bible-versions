These cities were significant Philistine strongholds. The restoration of these cities to Israel signifies a reversal of Philistine dominance, which had been a persistent threat since the time of Samson and the early days of Samuel. This restoration can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from their enemies when they turned back to Him (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-4</a>). The return of these cities also symbolizes the restoration of Israel's territorial integrity and God's favor upon them.<p><b>who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>The deliverance of the surrounding territory indicates a broader liberation beyond just the cities. This suggests a significant military victory and a shift in power dynamics in the region. The Philistines had been a constant oppressor, and their defeat here is reminiscent of earlier victories under leaders like Joshua. This deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, liberating believers from spiritual bondage.<p><b>And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites</b><br>The mention of peace with the Amorites, who were Canaanite inhabitants of the land, indicates a period of stability and security for Israel. This peace is significant because it shows that Israel's obedience to God and their reliance on Him for deliverance resulted in not only military success but also diplomatic and social stability. The peace with the Amorites can be seen as a foreshadowing of the peace that Christ brings, reconciling humanity to God and establishing harmony among people. This peace is a testament to God's covenant faithfulness and His desire for His people to live in harmony with their neighbors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron_and_gath.htm">Ekron and Gath</a></b><br>These were major Philistine cities.

Their mention marks the whole Philistine coastal corridor, showing how far Israel&#8217;s victory reached.<p>&#8226; God had earlier allowed the Philistines to oppress Israel because of Israel&#8217;s sin (<a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10</a>; <a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). Now, after national repentance led by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-6</a>), the Lord reverses that loss.<p>&#8226; The reference highlights concrete geography; this is not a vague spiritual triumph but a literal reclaiming of land, fulfilling God&#8217;s covenant promises of specific territory (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which the Philistines had taken</b><p>&#8226; The Philistines had seized these towns during Israel&#8217;s spiritual decline (<a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1-2</a>).

The verse assumes that history: the land was in enemy hands because Israel had strayed.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that the Philistines&#8217; power was never ultimate; it existed only by divine allowance, soon to be revoked when Israel returned to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were restored to Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Restored&#8221; means literally handed back.

Nothing remains under Philistine control between Ekron and Gath.<p>&#8226; This mirrors later victories under David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>) and anticipates final restoration themes seen in prophets like <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines</b><p>&#8226; The reclaiming radiates outward: farmland, villages, trade routes are liberated.

It fulfills covenant blessings promised for obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This peace shows that when God acts, even potential enemies stand down (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-29.htm">2 Chronicles 20:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Israel&#8217;s heartfelt repentance under Samuel leads to a sweeping, literal restoration: cities, countryside, and regional peace.

This note respecting them tells us that in these glorious days of the restoration of Israel under Samuel, not only were the Philistines of the coast kept in check and gradually subdued, but that the Canaanite tribes of the interior of the land submitted quietly to the old conditions imposed by Joshua at the time of the conquest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Ekron even unto Gath.</span> Not that Israel captured these two towns, but they mark the limits upon the borders, within which the Philistines had previously seized towns and villages belonging to Israel, and which Samuel now recovered. <span class="cmt_word">There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> In Israel's weakness the remains of this once powerful Canaanitish stock had probably made many a marauding expedition into the land, and carried off cattle and other plunder; now they sue for peace, and unite with Israel against the Philistines.
