The judgment on Eli's house is a divine decree due to the persistent sin within his family. The concept of "house" in biblical terms often refers to one's family lineage or dynasty. This judgment is significant as it marks a shift in the priestly line, which was initially promised to Aaron's descendants. The idea of a perpetual judgment highlights the severity of the offense and the importance of holiness in leadership roles.<p><b>for the iniquity of which he knows</b><br>Eli was aware of the sins committed by his sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who served as priests. Their actions were not hidden, and Eli's knowledge of their iniquity implies a level of responsibility. In the biblical context, leaders are held accountable for the actions of those under their authority, especially when they fail to address known sin. This reflects the broader biblical principle that to whom much is given, much is required (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><b>because his sons blasphemed God</b><br>Hophni and Phinehas' actions were considered blasphemous because they showed contempt for the sacred duties of the priesthood. They abused their positions by taking the best portions of sacrifices for themselves and engaging in immoral acts with women serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17, 22</a>). Blasphemy, in this context, is not just about speech but includes actions that desecrate what is holy. This connects to the broader biblical theme of reverence for God and His commands.<p><b>and he did not restrain them</b><br>Eli's failure to restrain his sons is a critical point of judgment. As a father and high priest, Eli had both familial and spiritual authority to correct his sons. His lack of action is seen as complicity in their sins. This highlights the biblical principle of discipline and correction within the family and community of faith (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Eli's inaction serves as a warning about the consequences of failing to uphold God's standards, especially for those in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, who served at the tabernacle in Shiloh.

Eli&#8217;s sons brazenly blasphemed, and Eli&#8217;s failure to act made him answerable. The verse calls every believer to uphold God&#8217;s holiness, exercise faithful oversight in the home and church, and respond promptly to divine warnings, trusting that obedience secures blessing while tolerated sin eventually meets God&#8217;s just discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Because his sons made themselves vile.</span>--The enormity of the sin of Eli and his house, which was to be so fearfully punished, must be measured by the extent of the mischief it worked; well-nigh all Israel were involved in it. The fatal example the priests had set at Shiloh filtrated through the entire people; the result was, that unbelief in the Eternal was becoming general throughout the land. The old pure religion was rapidly dying out of the hearts of the men, and the profligacy and covetousness of Shiloh would soon have been copied only too faithfully in all the homes of Israel. This fearful state of things was known to the high priest and judge, and still the weak and indulgent father refrained from removing his sons from their high office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I have told him,</span> etc. These words may be translated, with the Septuagint and Vulgate, "For I have told him that I would judge his house," referring back to the message of the man of God; or, with the Syriac, "And I will show him that I do judge his house." <span class="cmt_word">Forever</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> finally; his house shall pass away. <span class="cmt_word">His sons made themselves vile.</span> The verb used here invariably means <span class="accented">to curse</span>; but "they cursed themselves" does not, without straining, give a good sense.
