The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during Saul's reign, often engaging in battles with the Israelites. Saul's return from pursuing them suggests a temporary reprieve in hostilities, allowing him to focus on internal matters, particularly his pursuit of David. This pursuit of the Philistines highlights Saul's role as king and military leader, tasked with defending Israel from its enemies. The Philistines' presence in the land is a reminder of the incomplete conquest of Canaan, as they were one of the groups not fully driven out by the Israelites.<p><b>he was told, &#8220;David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.&#8221;</b><br>The wilderness of En-gedi is a significant geographical location, known for its rugged terrain and natural springs, providing a strategic hideout for David. En-gedi, meaning "spring of the young goat," is located near the Dead Sea, offering a place of refuge and sustenance in an otherwise arid region. This area is historically and archaeologically recognized for its caves and strongholds, making it an ideal location for David to evade Saul's pursuit. The mention of David being in En-gedi underscores his status as a fugitive, constantly on the run from Saul's attempts to capture him. This pursuit is a pivotal part of David's journey, shaping his character and reliance on God. The wilderness experience is a common biblical motif, often associated with testing and preparation, as seen in the lives of Moses and Jesus. David's time in En-gedi can be seen as a period of divine preparation for his future role as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Just moments earlier, Saul had almost caught David, but &#8220;a messenger came to Saul, saying, &#8216;Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-27.htm">1 Samuel 23:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s duty as king required him to break off the chase and defend Israel&#8212;echoing his original calling: &#8220;He will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is unmistakable: by steering Saul toward the Philistines, the Lord preserved David, much as He had done when &#8220;Jonathan told David, &#8216;Saul my father is seeking to kill you&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord orchestrating national threats to redirect personal conflicts (cf. <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a>). Here, a Philistine incursion becomes God&#8217;s instrument to protect His anointed servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was told</b><p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s intelligence network re-engages immediately. Earlier, the Ziphites ran to &#8220;Saul in Gibeah and said, &#8216;Is not David hiding among us?&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a>). Now, fresh informants hand Saul David&#8217;s new coordinates.<p>&#8226; The pattern highlights Saul&#8217;s reliance on human reports while neglecting divine guidance&#8212;a contrast to David, who &#8220;inquired of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeated alerts from subjects (Doeg in <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>; the Ziphites in 23:19) expose a kingdom on edge, ready to please an increasingly paranoid king.<p>&#8226; The wording underscores how quickly the adversary regroups: no sooner has Saul discharged one royal duty than gossip draws him back into personal vendetta.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; En-gedi (lit. &#8220;spring of the wild goats&#8221;) sits along the rugged west shore of the Dead Sea. Joshua cataloged it among Judah&#8217;s desert towns (<a href="/joshua/15-62.htm">Joshua 15:62</a>).<p>&#8226; The location blends harsh wilderness with life-giving springs&#8212;imagery later echoed in Song of Songs 1:14 (&#8220;my beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En-gedi&#8221;).<p>&#8226; For a fugitive, En-gedi&#8217;s cliffs, caves, and fresh water made ideal strongholds. David had already sought &#8220;strongholds at En-gedi&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-29.htm">1 Samuel 23:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This geographical note foreshadows the cave encounter where David spares Saul&#8217;s life (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3&#8211;7</a>), demonstrating mercy and trust in God&#8217;s timing.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the scene illustrates refuge in barren places, reminiscent of Elijah at the brook Cherith (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3-4</a>) and Jesus in the Judean wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a> sets the stage for one of Scripture&#8217;s most powerful lessons on restraint and godly character. God rescues David via a Philistine diversion, Saul returns to vengeance the moment the crisis passes, and David hides where rock, spring, and solitude converge. The verse reminds us that the Lord sovereignly directs national events for His redemptive purposes, exposes hearts by the reports they heed, and provides life-sustaining refuge even in the desert.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">When Saul was returned.</span>--How intent Saul was on his bloody purpose with regard to his supposed rival is clear, for no sooner was the Philistine raid repulsed than with sleepless animosity he at once set forth with a force, as the next verse relates, of considerable magnitude to hunt down his foe. Saul was encouraged in this fresh enterprise by the offer of the Ziphites (see preceding 1Sam <a href="/context/1_samuel/24-19.htm" title="For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? why the LORD reward you good for that you have done to me this day.">1Samuel 24:19-22</a>). These bitter enemies of David, in the interval of the Philistine war--accustomed to the passes and mountains of the barren region of the south of Canaan--complying with the king's request (<a href="/1_samuel/23-23.htm" title="See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.">1Samuel 23:23</a>), had taken careful knowledge of the lurking-places where David was hiding, and were now prepared to act as guides to the well-equipped and disciplined forces under Saul in its marches and counter-marches in the deserts bordering on the south of Judah.<p><span class= "bld">En-gedi.</span>--David and his band were now wandering along a lofty plateau, upon the tops of cliffs some 2,000 feet above the Dead Sea. En-gedi--still known as Ain-jedy, the Fountain of the Kid--is a beautiful oasis, in the barren wilderness to the south of Judah. Its original name was Hazazon Tamar--"The Palm Wood" (see <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm" title="Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against you from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.">2Chronicles 20:2</a>)--and was once an ancient settlement of the Amorites (see <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>). It has in all ages been a favourite spot with the possessors of the land. King Solomon appears to have paid peculiar attention to this garden of the wilderness. He planted the hills round it with vines; from the fountain flows a warm limpid stream, delicious to the taste. The remains of ancient gardens tell us that in the golden days of the kings En-gedi was probably a favourite resort of the wealthy citizen of Jerusalem. Solpmon, in his "Song of Songs," writes of it in a strain which shows how he loved it, when he compares his beloved "to a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi."--<a href="/songs/1-14.htm" title="My beloved is to me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>. Its present condition, as described by modern travellers, more nearly resembles the En-gedi when Saul hunted David among the rocks and caverns than the En-gedi the resort of the Jerusalem citizens, beautiful with gardens and vines of Solomon.--Conder: <span class= "ital">Tent Life. </span>Dean Stanley and others have described the spot with great care, and left us a vivid picture of the scene. They tell us of the long and weary journey-across the desolate valleys and precipitous barren heights, and of the enchanting scene which lay before them when once Ain-jedy was reached. They describe in flowing language the plentiful and rich vegetation, the trees and fruits, the ruins of the ancient gardens, and remains of the beautiful groves, still inhabited by a multitude of singing birds. In the limestone cliffs are numerous caves, some of them very large and deep, well calculated to be the temporary shelter of large bodies of men. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of En-gedi.</span> Finding no safety on the western side of the desert of Judah, where the Ziphites were ever watching his movements, David now boldly crossed this arid waste, and sought shelter in the remarkable oasis of En-gedi, on the shore of the Dead Sea. The word may signify either the Fountain of Luck or the Kid's Spring, the latter being the meaning of the name Ain-Jadi, which it still bears. In <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a> it is identified with Hazazon-Tamar, the Palm Wood, an ancient seat of the Amorites, and evidently famous from of old for its fertility (<a href="/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>). Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:126) describes the country over which David would have to travel as almost impassable, so that in four and a half hours of hard riding be and his party advanced only six miles, so deep were the valleys which they were obliged to cross. From a lofty peak on their way the view was most extraordinary. On every side were other ridges, equally white, steep, and narrow; their sides seamed by innumerable torrent beds, their summits sharp and rugged in outline. Not a tree was visible, and the whole region was like the dry basin of a former sea, scoured by the rains, and washed down in places to the hard foundation of metamorphic limestone which underlies the whole district. But the desert once crossed, "there is no scene," he says, "more vividly impressed on my memory than that of this magnificently rocky and savage pass, and the view from the spring below." He had encamped on a plateau upon the top of the cliffs, which rise to a height of 2000 feet above the Dead Sea; and 1340 feet below him the warm spring of En-gedi, 83&deg; F., rises from under a great boulder, and dashing down the rest of the descent, flows across the plate at the foot of the cliffs, which is about half a mile square. All around are the ruins of ancient gardens and thickets, among which he saw the beautiful black grackles with gold-tipped wings, bulbuls, and thrushes. Solomon seems to have delighted in the spot, and to have covered the hills with vines; for he compares his beloved to a "cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi" (<a href="/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>). Neither palm nor vine is to be found there now, but there is still a rich vegetation, and groves of trees. According to Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 602) the sides of the ravines leading to En-gedi are full of natural and artificial caves and sepulchres. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
