This annual pilgrimage to Shiloh was part of the Israelites' adherence to the Mosaic Law, which required them to appear before the Lord at the tabernacle for certain feasts (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>).<p><b>his mother would make him a little robe</b><br>Hannah, Samuel's mother, made him a robe, which signifies her ongoing care and love for her son, even after dedicating him to the Lord's service. The robe, or "ephod," was a garment associated with priestly duties, suggesting Samuel's growing role in the tabernacle. This act of making a robe each year also symbolizes Hannah's continued commitment to her vow to God (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>).<p><b>and bring it to him</b><br>Hannah's act of bringing the robe to Samuel demonstrates her personal involvement and dedication to her son's well-being and spiritual growth. It reflects the nurturing aspect of motherhood and the importance of parental support in a child's spiritual journey.<p><b>when she went with her husband</b><br>This phrase underscores the unity and partnership between Hannah and her husband, Elkanah, in their religious observance and family responsibilities. It highlights the importance of family unity in worship and the shared commitment to fulfilling vows made to God.<p><b>to offer the annual sacrifice</b><br>The annual sacrifice refers to the offerings made during the pilgrimage to the tabernacle, which were part of the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. These sacrifices were acts of worship, thanksgiving, and atonement, reflecting the centrality of sacrificial worship in Israelite religion.

Not improbably the old man, too, well aware of the character of his own sons, hoped to train up the favoured child--whose connection with himself and the sanctuary had begun in so remarkable a manner--as his successor in the chief sacred and civil office in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His mother made him a little coat.</span> The coat, <span class="accented">meil</span>, was worn by priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a>), by kings and their sons (<a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>), by prophets (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 28:14), and even by women (<a href="/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>). It was an under garment of wool, woven throughout without seam, with holes for the head and arms, and reaching nearly to the ground: when used by women it had sleeves (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). Under it they had a tunic or shirt fitting so closely that a man simply so clad was considered naked (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), and over it priests and Levites wore the ephod, and so also David on the occasion mentioned above (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>). The <span class="accented">meil</span> seems, moreover, to have often been a handsome dress, as that of the priests was of purple blue, with embroidery of pomegranates in three colours, and golden bells (<a href="/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-34</a>); and when made of delicate materials for the use of the rich, it and the tunic are the soft luxurious clothing spoken of in <a href="/matthew/11-8.htm">Matthew 11:8</a>. As the meal was the ordinary dress of all classes of people, it was made for Samuel at home, and can have no special meaning; but the ephod shows that he was brought up in the daffy practice of holy duties. This annual present, however, of clothing made by the mother's hands proves that the dedication of her son to God was not allowed to interfere with home affections, and both parents and child must have looked forward with joy to happy meetings at each recurrence of the family visit to the sanctuary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Each year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
