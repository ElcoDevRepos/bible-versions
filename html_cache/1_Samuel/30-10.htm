The phrase highlights the physical and emotional exhaustion of David's men after a long journey and the distress of finding their homes devastated. The "brook" referred to is the Brook Besor, a geographical location in the southern part of Judah. This brook served as a natural boundary and resting place. The exhaustion of the two hundred men underscores the human limitations and the need for rest, even in times of crisis. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of human frailty and the need for divine strength, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives power to the faint.<p><b>But David and four hundred men continued in pursuit.</b><br>Despite the exhaustion of part of his force, David's leadership and determination are evident as he continues the pursuit with four hundred men. This decision demonstrates David's reliance on God's promise of victory and his role as a decisive leader. The number four hundred is significant, as it often represents a complete and sufficient force in biblical narratives. David's pursuit is a testament to his faith and trust in God's guidance, reminiscent of his earlier victories, such as his triumph over Goliath. This pursuit also foreshadows the relentless pursuit of Christ for His people, as seen in the parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>, where the shepherd leaves the ninety-nine to find the one lost sheep. David's actions here prefigure the redemptive mission of Jesus, who seeks and saves the lost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, leading his men in pursuit of the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that attacked Ziklag, taking captives and plundering the city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brook_besor.htm">The Brook Besor</a></b><br>A stream in the southern part of Judah, serving as a natural barrier in the pursuit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_hundred_men.htm">The Two Hundred Men</a></b><br>Part of David's forces who were too exhausted to continue the pursuit beyond the brook.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_hundred_men.htm">The Four Hundred Men</a></b><br>The remaining part of David's forces who continued the pursuit with him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_in_adversity.htm">Leadership in Adversity</a></b><br>David exemplifies leadership by continuing the pursuit despite the exhaustion of his men.

These soldiers had marched three days from Aphek to Ziklag, discovered their city burned, then set off in immediate pursuit of the Amalekites. The text underscores real human limits; even the bravest warriors can reach the end of their strength (cf. <a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>). The Spirit-inspired record simply states the fact without rebuke, reminding us that fatigue is not failure&#8212;God remembers we are dust (<a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To cross the brook</b><p>&#8226; The Brook Besor lay about fifteen miles south of Ziklag. In early spring its banks can be steep and its waters swift. For exhausted men, one more ford was impossible. Scripture often uses physical barriers to highlight dependence on the Lord (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-17</a>; <a href="/psalms/124-2.htm">Psalm 124:2-5</a>). Here the brook becomes a providential resting point where the faint can recover supplies and guard baggage (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But David and four hundred men</b><p>&#8226; David began with six hundred followers (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). Four hundred press on&#8212;twice the number of those who stay. This balance keeps the focus on God&#8217;s promise, not human math. The four hundred mirror the earlier description of David&#8217;s band: &#8220;everyone in distress&#8230; and David became their commander&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>). Loyalty has grown; the same men who once fled from Saul now trust David enough to pursue an enemy deep into the desert.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Continued in pursuit</b><p>&#8226; David is acting on the clear word he had just received: &#8220;Pursue them, for you will surely overtake them and rescue the captives&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>). Obedience looks like motion&#8212;even when resources are halved. The verse anticipates complete victory (<a href="/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18-19</a>) and equitable sharing of spoils with those who stayed behind (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>; cf. <a href="/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a>). The episode echoes God&#8217;s pattern in Gideon&#8217;s day: a reduced force highlights divine deliverance, not human strength (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-10.htm">1 Samuel 30:10</a> records a simple logistical detail that carries rich meaning. Two hundred men, spent after days of forced march, stop at the Brook Besor; four hundred keep going with David because God has promised success. The verse illustrates human limitation, wise leadership, and steadfast faith in God&#8217;s word. By including both the exhausted and the pursuing, Scripture affirms that every believer&#8212;whether resting or advancing&#8212;has a place in the Lord&#8217;s unfolding victory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were too exhausted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(pig&#183;g&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6296.htm">Strong's 6296: </a> </span><span class="str2">To relax, become exhausted</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to cross</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
