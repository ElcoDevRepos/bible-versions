Abner's role as a military leader is significant, as he is expected to protect the king. This interaction underscores the tension between David and Saul, as well as David's respect for the anointed king despite being pursued by him.<p><b>&#8220;You are a man, aren&#8217;t you?</b><br>David questions Abner's competence and courage, emphasizing the expectation of strength and vigilance in a leader. This rhetorical question challenges Abner's failure to fulfill his duty, reflecting the biblical theme of accountability. It also highlights the irony of David, the fugitive, demonstrating more integrity and capability than the king's own commander.<p><b>And who in Israel is your equal?</b><br>David acknowledges Abner's high status and reputation in Israel, which makes his failure even more glaring. This phrase points to the cultural importance of honor and reputation in ancient Israelite society. It also serves to contrast Abner's esteemed position with his lack of action, further emphasizing the gravity of his oversight.<p><b>Why then did you not protect your lord the king</b><br>David's question underscores the sacred duty to protect the anointed king, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. This reflects the biblical principle of loyalty to God's chosen leader, despite personal conflicts. David's respect for Saul's anointing is a recurring theme, illustrating his own righteousness and foreshadowing his future as king.<p><b>when one of the people came to destroy him?</b><br>David refers to his own opportunity to harm Saul, which he refrained from taking. This highlights David's integrity and his trust in God's timing for his ascension to the throne. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the divine protection over Saul, despite his disobedience, and foreshadows the eventual transfer of kingship to David, aligning with God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.

He has Saul&#8217;s spear and water jug in hand, tangible proof that he could have killed the king yet chose restraint, just as he had previously in the cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8-12</a>). By speaking directly to the commander, David:<p>&#8226; Exposes the failure without humiliating Saul in front of the troops.<p>&#8226; Demonstrates his continued respect for &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Shows that genuine righteousness can challenge wrongdoing while still honoring God-ordained authority (cf. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are a man, aren&#8217;t you?</b><p>This rhetorical question appeals to Abner&#8217;s sense of honor and masculinity. In Israelite culture, a &#8220;man&#8221; was expected to be courageous and vigilant (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>). David&#8217;s tone implies, &#8220;Act like the warrior you claim to be.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Responsibility goes hand-in-hand with identity; title alone is meaningless if duty is neglected.<p>&#8226; God repeatedly links courage with obedience (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Abner&#8217;s lapse shows that courage without watchfulness falls short.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And who in Israel is your equal?</b><p>Abner is the army&#8217;s top commander (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7, 39</a>). David grants him full credit:<p>&#8226; Acknowledging a leader&#8217;s stature heightens the weight of accountability (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>, &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Even the most gifted are answerable to God&#8217;s standards; prominence never exempts from vigilance (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why then did you not protect your lord the king</b><p>Abner&#8217;s core duty was to guard Saul. David&#8217;s question unmasks dereliction:<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s safety was non-negotiable; sleep-duty failures warranted death (compare <a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; David, though hunted, still honors Saul&#8217;s rightful office, modeling submission to God&#8217;s order (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Failure of guardianship threatens national stability, illustrating that spiritual neglect endangers more than just individuals (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When one of the people came to destroy him?</b><p>David references Abishai, the companion who urged him to kill Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/26-8.htm">1 Samuel 26:8</a>). Abner missed the entire incursion:<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;one of the people&#8221; minimizes Abishai&#8217;s identity, underscoring that even a single unnoticed intruder could end the king&#8217;s life.<p>&#8226; Vigilance is a round-the-clock assignment; lapses invite disaster (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, &#8220;Guard your heart with all diligence&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence, not Abner&#8217;s prowess, preserved Saul. Yet human responsibility remains (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s midnight call confronts Abner with four piercing questions that expose negligent leadership. By honoring Saul while rebuking his guard, David reaffirms God&#8217;s order, the necessity of vigilant stewardship, and the sobering truth that position without faithfulness is empty. The verse reminds believers that recognition, strength, and titles are gifts meant to be exercised in loyal service to God and the authorities He establishes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">A valiant man.</span>--The English translators have rightly emphasised the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ish </span>here by rendering a "valiant" man. <span class= "ital">Ish </span>was used not unfrequently in this "nobler" sense; so in <a href="/psalms/49-2.htm" title="Both low and high, rich and poor, together.">Psalm 49:2</a>, when the <span class= "ital">b'ne adam, </span>as "the poor mean ones," were contrasted with the <span class= "ital">b'ne ish, "</span>the noble ones."
