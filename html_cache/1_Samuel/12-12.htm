The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, and their territory was east of the Jordan River. Historically, the Ammonites were known for their hostility towards Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>. Nahash's aggression is a catalyst for Israel's demand for a human king, highlighting their fear and lack of trust in God's protection. This reflects a recurring theme in Israel's history where external threats lead to internal spiritual crises.<p><b>you said to me, &#8216;No, we must have a king to rule over us&#8217;</b><br>This statement marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history. The Israelites' demand for a king signifies a shift from a theocratic system, where God directly ruled through judges, to a monarchy. This request was not merely political but spiritual, indicating a desire to conform to the surrounding nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). It reveals a lack of faith in God's sovereignty and protection, despite His past deliverances. This decision would have long-term consequences, as seen in the subsequent reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon.<p><b>even though the LORD your God was your king</b><br>This phrase underscores the theological error in Israel's request. God was their true king, as established in the covenant at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The demand for a human king was a rejection of God's kingship and a failure to recognize His provision and guidance. This reflects a deeper spiritual issue of idolatry and self-reliance. The desire for a human king foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingship in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, who perfectly embodies God's rule and reign (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahash.htm">Nahash</a></b><br>King of the Ammonites, an enemy of Israel who threatened them, prompting their demand for a human king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet who anointed Saul as king and delivered God's messages to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who demanded a king to lead them, rejecting God's direct kingship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, led by Nahash during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who was their divine king and protector.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_vs._human_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty vs. Human Leadership</a></b><br>The Israelites' demand for a king reflects a lack of trust in God's sovereignty.

We thus, too, should be able to account for the rancour displayed in his wish so to treat the men of that town as to make them a reproach to all Israel; for his hatred of Israel may have grown in intensity in the course of a harassing war, or he may have learnt to despise a people incapable of offering a regular resistance.
