In the context of ancient Israel, growth often implied increasing wisdom and stature in the community. Samuel's upbringing in the temple under Eli's guidance positioned him uniquely for his prophetic role. His growth can be compared to that of Jesus, who "grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man" (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p><b>and the LORD was with him</b><br>The presence of the LORD with Samuel indicates divine favor and guidance. This phrase echoes the covenantal promise seen throughout the Old Testament, where God assures His presence with His chosen leaders, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). It underscores Samuel's role as a prophet and leader, chosen by God to guide Israel during a tumultuous period.<p><b>and He let none of Samuel&#8217;s words fall to the ground</b><br>This phrase signifies the effectiveness and reliability of Samuel's prophetic ministry. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a prophet's words were considered powerful and authoritative when they consistently came to pass. The imagery of words not falling to the ground suggests that everything Samuel spoke was fulfilled, affirming his role as a true prophet of God. This reliability is reminiscent of the prophetic accuracy expected of God's messengers, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>. Samuel's words being upheld by God also prefigure the ultimate fulfillment of God's Word in Jesus Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young prophet and judge in Israel, dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah.

Earlier we were told, &#8220;The boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>), and this theme echoes the pattern later seen in Christ: &#8220;And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s growth marks the steady unfolding of God&#8217;s plan despite the moral decline surrounding him (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). His life demonstrates that faithful obedience positions us to develop exactly as the Lord intends (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: Growth is not an optional add-on for believers; it is expected. Just as Samuel didn&#8217;t remain a perpetual child in the tabernacle, we are called to mature in faith (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD was with him</b><p>&#8226; Scripture records the Lord&#8217;s personal presence with key servants&#8212;Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>), Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>), Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). Samuel belongs in that line: God wasn&#8217;t distant; He was unmistakably &#8220;with him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The divine presence gave Samuel authority well before Israel recognized him as prophet (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). When God is &#8220;with&#8221; someone, His power, protection, and guidance follow (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the contrast with Eli&#8217;s household, where &#8220;the word of the LORD was rare&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>). Samuel&#8217;s intimacy with God shines brighter against that backdrop.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: The Lord&#8217;s presence is the heartbeat of effective ministry. Talents or heritage cannot substitute for it (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He let none of Samuel&#8217;s words fall to the ground</b><p>&#8226; A vivid picture: not a single prophetic utterance dropped uselessly &#8220;to the ground.&#8221; God upheld every word, fulfilling it precisely. That fulfils His own standard: &#8220;When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the word does not come to pass&#8230; that is a word the LORD has not spoken&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Soon &#8220;all Israel from Dan to Beersheba&#8221; would recognize Samuel as an established prophet (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>), because the Lord Himself vindicated him. The same principle is later affirmed to Jeremiah: &#8220;I am watching over My word to accomplish it&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This reliability undergirds our confidence in Scripture today (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). If the Lord safeguarded Samuel&#8217;s spoken words, we can trust He has preserved the written Word for us with equal faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God&#8217;s promises never fail; our task is to know them, speak them faithfully, and expect Him to honor them (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s steady growth, the Lord&#8217;s abiding presence, and the flawless fulfillment of Samuel&#8217;s words combine to show how God develops, empowers, and authenticates His servants. We are invited to grow consistently, live consciously in the Lord&#8217;s presence, and trust wholeheartedly that every promise He has spoken will stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him.</span>--Again in a brief sentence the life of Samuel was contrasted with another: this time with that of his predecessor in the judgeship. As the boy grew up to manhood, we hear that while, on the one hand, as, no doubt, in earlier days with Eli, so now with Samuel, the Lord was with His servant, giving him strength and wisdom, guiding him and guarding him; and, on the other, different from Eli, we hear how the young prophet let none of the Divine words fall to the ground. In those dark days of sin and shame at Shiloh, in the midst of scenes of temptation, the boy stood firm; his early life was a perpetual protest against covetousness and iniquity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel grew.</span> His childhood up to this time has been carefully kept before our view; now he passes from youth to manhood. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehovah was with him.</span> By special gifts, but especially by establishing his words. Spoken by Divine inspiration, they were all fulfilled. So in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a> the words of the wise are compared to "nails fastened" securely, and which may therefore be depended upon. But in their case it is experience and sound judgment that makes them foresee what is likely to happen; it was a higher gift which made Samuel's words remain safe and sure, and capable of firmly holding up all enterprises that were hung upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grew,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7713;&#183;dal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
