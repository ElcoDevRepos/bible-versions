This moment occurs during a period when David is being pursued by King Saul, who is seeking to kill him. David's restraint and respect for Saul's position as the Lord's anointed king are central themes in this narrative.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives,</b><br>This phrase underscores David's deep faith and reliance on God. It reflects the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. David's oath indicates his belief in God's sovereignty and justice, a common theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>the LORD Himself will strike him down;</b><br>David expresses his conviction that God will deal with Saul in His own time and way. This reflects a broader biblical principle of divine retribution and justice, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares that vengeance belongs to Him. David's refusal to harm Saul demonstrates his trust in God's righteous judgment.<p><b>either his day will come and he will die,</b><br>David acknowledges the inevitability of death, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, which speaks of a time to be born and a time to die. This phrase suggests David's understanding that every person has an appointed time, and it is not his place to hasten Saul's end.<p><b>or he will go into battle and perish.</b><br>This reflects the common fate of many ancient Near Eastern kings and warriors, who often met their end in battle. It foreshadows Saul's eventual death in battle against the Philistines, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>.

When he says, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives&#8221;, he is anchoring every following statement in the living God who never fails to act justly. Similar affirmations appear in <a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a> and <a href="/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>, underscoring that believers may rely on God&#8217;s unchanging character. By swearing on the Lord&#8217;s life, David:<p>&#8226; Reminds Abishai that God is watching and ruling (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Confesses that all events unfold under God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Declares his own submission to divine timing and method rather than seizing control (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD Himself will strike him down</b><p>David refuses to harm Saul because he trusts that &#8220;the LORD Himself will strike him down&#8221;. He recognizes God as the righteous Judge who alone has the prerogative to remove kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). This conviction echoes earlier events&#8212;God struck Nabal dead for his folly (<a href="/1_samuel/25-38.htm">1 Samuel 25:38</a>) and later judged Uzziah for presumption (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). By stepping back:<p>&#8226; David relinquishes personal vengeance (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>).<p>&#8226; He models faith in God&#8217;s promised justice (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; He protects his conscience from bloodguilt (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>either his day will come and he will die</b><p>&#8220;Either his day will come and he will die&#8221; points to the fixed boundary God sets for every life (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). David believes:<p>&#8226; Each person faces an appointed &#8220;day&#8221; determined by the Lord (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s downfall need not be forced; it will arrive in God&#8217;s perfect schedule (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Waiting on that day keeps David from shortcuts that might disqualify him for future kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or he will go into battle and perish</b><p>David adds a second, equally plausible scenario: Saul &#8220;will go into battle and perish&#8221;. The battlefield was a common means by which God judged rulers (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34-38</a>). Indeed, Saul&#8217;s end came in combat on Mount Gilboa (<a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-6</a>). This option highlights that:<p>&#8226; God may use ordinary circumstances&#8212;warfare, illness, or accident&#8212;to fulfill His word (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine sovereignty works through both natural and extraordinary means (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Trusting God&#8217;s methods frees believers from manipulating outcomes while still pursuing righteousness (<a href="/psalms/37-34.htm">Psalm 37:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s statement teaches that the living God will bring justice in His own time and way. Because God is alive, sovereign, and just, His servants can refuse personal vengeance, wait for His appointed day, and trust that He will either directly intervene or work through ordinary events to accomplish His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">David said furthermore.</span>--David suggests three possible cases in which the Divine arm might smite the "anointed of Jehovah." The first, the Lord "shall smite him" by some sudden death from disease--no doubt, the recent death of Nabal was in his mind; the second by what is termed "natural death;" and the third by some blow received in battle. The idea of an arrow winged by some unseen hand was evidently here in the speaker's thoughts.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">added,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
