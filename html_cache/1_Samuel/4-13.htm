In the context of ancient Israel, messengers were often sent to deliver news of military outcomes. The arrival signifies a moment of anticipation and potential dread, as the outcome of the battle would have significant implications for the nation.<p><b>there was Eli</b><br>Eli was the high priest and judge of Israel at the time. His presence here highlights his leadership role and his personal investment in the events unfolding. Eli's age and declining physical condition are noted earlier in the text, emphasizing his vulnerability and the gravity of the situation.<p><b>sitting on his chair beside the road</b><br>Eli's position by the road indicates his anxious waiting for news. In ancient times, roads were the primary means of communication between cities and battlefields. His sitting posture suggests a state of readiness and concern, as he is unable to participate actively due to his age.<p><b>and watching</b><br>Eli's watching signifies his deep concern and anticipation. This vigilance reflects his responsibility as a leader and his personal connection to the ark of God, which was central to Israel's worship and identity.<p><b>because his heart trembled for the ark of God</b><br>The ark of God was the most sacred object in Israel, representing God's presence among His people. Eli's trembling heart indicates his fear for the ark's safety, knowing its capture would be a devastating spiritual and national loss. This concern underscores the ark's significance and foreshadows the tragic events to follow.<p><b>When the man entered the city to give a report</b><br>The messenger's entry into the city marks the transition from anticipation to the revelation of the battle's outcome. In ancient Israel, cities were centers of community life, and news of this magnitude would have been of immediate and intense interest to all inhabitants.<p><b>the whole city cried out</b><br>The collective cry of the city reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where the fate of the nation was shared by all. This outcry signifies the depth of despair and the impact of the news, which would have included the loss of life, the defeat of the army, and the capture of the ark. The city's reaction underscores the gravity of the situation and sets the stage for the subsequent events in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, Eli was an elderly man whose heart was deeply concerned for the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_god.htm">The Ark of God</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.

Scripture treats such messengers as reliable witnesses to literal events (<a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2-4</a>), underscoring the historical trustworthiness of the narrative.<p>&#8226; God allows the news to travel quickly so that Israel may reckon with the consequences of sin and misplaced confidence (<a href="/psalms/78-59.htm">Psalm 78:59-61</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>b).<p>&#8226; The high priest is positioned outside Shiloh rather than in the sanctuary, signaling anxious anticipation and perhaps a sense of unworthiness to stand before the LORD after allowing his sons&#8217; corruption (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; His posture recalls the watchman who waits for tidings in <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24-27</a> and underlines a shepherd&#8217;s duty to look after the flock (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s physical blindness (<a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>) contrasts with his spiritual awareness&#8212;he cannot see clearly, yet he senses the gravity of the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His heart trembled for the ark of God</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;because his heart trembled for the ark of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s fear is not chiefly for Israel&#8217;s armies or even for his sons but for the sacred ark that represents God&#8217;s covenant presence (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse exposes Israel&#8217;s misplaced confidence: they treated the ark as a battle talisman (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-4</a>), but Eli rightly fears losing fellowship with God more than losing a battle (<a href="/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The trembling heart fulfills Samuel&#8217;s earlier warning that judgment would strike Eli&#8217;s house in one day (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The man entered the city to give a report</b><p>&#8220;When the man entered the city to give a report&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

Shiloh&#8217;s collective wail echoes Israel&#8217;s reaction after the spies&#8217; bad report (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1</a>) and anticipates the mourning at the exile of the ark in <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-64</a>.<p>&#8226;

The verse underscores three truths: God&#8217;s presence is more vital than military strength, sin&#8217;s consequences are certain, and fulfilled prophecy proves the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;even in judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Eli sat upon a seat.</span>--The text here is a little confused, but the sense is perfectly clear.

(See <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>here.) The LXX. renders it, "by the side of the gate watching the way."<p>The old judge was naturally anxious for news from the army. It must be remembered the people had already (<a href="/1_samuel/4-2.htm" title="And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.">1Samuel 4:2</a>) suffered a great reverse in the first battle of Aphek, when 4,000 fell, but his chief anxiety was for that sacred Ark which he had allowed--no doubt against his better judgment--to leave the sanctuary. All had gone wrong lately, and the high priest was deeply conscious that he, for his part, with his culpable weakness, and his priestly sons, with their flagrant wickedness, had broken the covenant with the invisible King. Eli knew too much of the Eternal Guardian of Israel to put any real trust in the power of the lifeless Ark. It was a long time, the high priest well knew, since the glory had rested on its golden mercy-seat between the silent cherubim. Had that mysterious light shone in the dark Holy of Holies since the night when the Divine voice spoke to the child, telling him the doom of the house of Ithamar? So he waited with sorrowful forebodings the advent of the messenger, asking himself, Would the Ark ever return to Shiloh?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon a seat</span> - literally, "the throne" - <span class="cmt_word">by the wayside,</span> whither his official chair had been removed to some spot near the gate of the city (see ver. 18), and probably commanding a view of the pathway by which a messenger would arrive. There probably for hours he had sat, anxiously awaiting tidings of the ark, which, we may feel sure, he had very unwillingly allowed to be carried away into the camp. <span class="cmt_word">When the man came into the city.</span> Literally the words are, "And the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out." We are not to suppose with some that Eli, being old and now blind, let the messenger slip by unobserved. A man of his high rank would not be alone, and the mention of his throne suggests that he was seated there in somewhat of official dignity. And so, as the runner drew near, with the symbols of disaster upon his person, the priests and Levites in attendance upon Eli would begin the cry of sorrow, and soon it would spread throughout all Shiloh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When he arrived,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
