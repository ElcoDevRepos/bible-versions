The context is significant as it follows the Israelites' demand for a king, which Samuel viewed as a rejection of God's direct rule. The terms "cheated" and "oppressed" reflect common grievances against leaders in ancient times, where corruption and abuse of power were prevalent. Samuel's leadership is contrasted with the potential for corruption under a monarchy, as seen later in the reigns of Saul and other kings. This statement underscores the biblical principle of righteous leadership, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, which warns against perverting justice.<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The response of the people is crucial as it serves as a public testimony to Samuel's character. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal affirmation was a powerful tool for establishing truth and accountability. This collective reply indicates a consensus among the people, highlighting the respect and trust Samuel had earned. It also sets a standard for future leaders, emphasizing the importance of public accountability and integrity.<p><b>nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Samuel's refusal to exploit his position for personal gain, a common issue among leaders in the ancient Near East. The mention of "the hand of man" suggests a broader context of fairness and justice, aligning with the biblical theme of leaders serving rather than being served. This echoes the warnings against covetousness and greed found in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a> and is a precursor to the New Testament teachings on servant leadership, as exemplified by Jesus Christ in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>.
