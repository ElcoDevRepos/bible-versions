Nabal's excessive drinking reflects the cultural practices of feasting and revelry common in ancient Near Eastern societies. The morning signifies a new beginning or revelation, often used in Scripture to denote clarity or judgment (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). Nabal's sobriety allows him to comprehend the gravity of the situation, highlighting the contrast between his previous foolishness and the impending consequences.<p><b>his wife told him about these events</b><br>Abigail, Nabal's wife, plays a crucial role as a mediator and wise counselor. Her actions earlier in the chapter prevented David from taking vengeance on Nabal. This moment underscores the biblical theme of a prudent wife being a blessing (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>). Abigail's communication of the events to Nabal demonstrates her integrity and the importance of truth-telling, even when it involves delivering difficult news.<p><b>and his heart failed within him</b><br>This phrase suggests a sudden and severe emotional or physical reaction, possibly a heart attack or stroke. In biblical literature, the heart often symbolizes the center of emotions and will. Nabal's heart failing can be seen as divine retribution for his folly and arrogance, aligning with the biblical principle that God opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). It also serves as a narrative turning point, leading to the fulfillment of God's justice.<p><b>and he became like a stone</b><br>The imagery of becoming "like a stone" indicates paralysis or death, emphasizing the finality of Nabal's condition. Stones in Scripture often symbolize judgment or a hardened heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). This transformation from a living, active man to a lifeless state serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's anointed and living foolishly. It foreshadows the ultimate judgment that awaits those who oppose God's purposes, drawing a parallel to the fate of those who reject Christ, the cornerstone (<a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but foolish man whose name means "fool" in Hebrew.

Scripture often uses morning as a moment of reckoning or mercy&#8212;&#8220;They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>). Here it is a reckoning. Much like Abraham rising &#8220;early in the morning&#8221; to view the smoke of Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>), the early light reveals consequences that cannot be postponed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when Nabal was sober</b><p>The contrast between Nabal&#8217;s previous intoxication and present sobriety is stark. God&#8217;s Word warns, &#8220;Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). Once the wine&#8217;s fog lifts, Nabal has no defenses. <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> reminds us that wine can mock and deceive; Nabal&#8217;s temporary escape only stored up greater terror for the moment clear thinking returned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his wife told him about these events</b><p>Abigail recounts how close Nabal came to annihilation and how the Lord spared their household through her intervention. A godly wife &#8220;does him good and not evil all the days of her life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-12.htm">Proverbs 31:12</a>). Her honesty fulfills the helper role given in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>. Unlike Ananias and Sapphira who conspired in sin (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>), Abigail stands for righteousness and transparency, even when truth is painful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his heart failed within him</b><p>The phrase paints a sudden collapse of courage, and likely of physical strength. Scripture describes the wicked whose &#8220;hearts melt like wax within them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>). Fear, guilt, and divine judgment converge&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; words about men &#8220;fainting from fear and the expectation of what is coming upon the earth&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>). Nabal&#8217;s inner defenses crumble before the realization of God&#8217;s near judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he became like a stone</b><p>Whether a stroke, paralysis, or sheer terror, the effect is immediate immobilization. Similar language appears when the dread of the LORD makes enemies &#8220;still as a stone&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>). Ten days later &#8220;the LORD struck Nabal dead&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-38.htm">1 Samuel 25:38</a>), confirming that his condition was more than medical&#8212;it was divine sentence. Jeroboam&#8217;s hand withering at the altar (<a href="/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>) supplies another instance where God freezes a rebel in judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/25-37.htm">1 Samuel 25:37</a> shows the sober dawn of accountability. Once the wine is gone, Abigail&#8217;s truthful report confronts Nabal with his folly. Fear seizes him, God&#8217;s judgment immobilizes him, and his fate is sealed. The verse warns that a heart hardened in self-indulgence can face sudden, irrevocable reckoning, while also highlighting the protective grace that God extends through the righteous actions of the faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">When the wine was gone out.</span>--Simply, when the brutish, selfish reveller had become sober by lapse of time.<p><span class= "bld">His heart died within him.</span>--These words are generally understood as signifying that an attack of apoplexy had seized the intemperate man. Commentators are a little divided as to the immediate cause of the stroke. (a) It was brought on by fear, hearing to what a terrible danger he had been, through his reckless, unguarded language and churlish conduct, exposed. In that drunken sleep, out of which he was then scarcely awakened, he and all his family would have perished miserably had it not been for his wife's forethought. In his enfeebled state, feverish and excited still with the strong drink, terror and horror seized him, and the "stroke" followed. (b) A furious burst of anger at his wife's intelligence swept over him: that she should have humiliated herself before one whom he evidently hated, like David, was to him unbearable; and the wild burst of anger acting on the ruined, drink-shattered frame completed the mischief, and the result was the stroke of apoplexy. The first is, however, the more probable.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the morning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
