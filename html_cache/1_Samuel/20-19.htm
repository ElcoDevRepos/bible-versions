In this context, it reflects the urgency and gravity of the situation between David and Jonathan. The number three is frequently seen in Scripture, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), symbolizing a time of transition or divine intervention.<p><b>hurry down to the place you hid</b><br>This phrase indicates a prearranged plan between David and Jonathan, highlighting their deep friendship and trust. The act of hiding suggests the danger David is in due to King Saul's jealousy and intent to kill him. The need to "hurry" underscores the imminent threat and the urgency of the situation. This reflects the broader theme of God's protection over David, who is anointed to be king despite Saul's pursuit.<p><b>on the day this trouble began</b><br>The "trouble" refers to Saul's growing hostility towards David, which began after David's success and popularity following his victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-9</a>). This marks a turning point in David's life, where he transitions from a favored servant to a fugitive. It also highlights the spiritual battle between God's chosen king and the rejected king, Saul.<p><b>and remain beside the stone Ezel</b><br>The stone Ezel serves as a landmark for David, providing a specific location for Jonathan to communicate with him. Stones often serve as memorials or witnesses in biblical narratives, such as the stones set up by Joshua in the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20-24</a>). The stone Ezel may symbolize God's faithfulness and the covenant between David and Jonathan. It also foreshadows Christ, the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), who is a refuge and foundation for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks his life.

David must resist the urge to act prematurely, knowing the Lord &#8220;acts on behalf of those who wait for Him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s command protects David by staggering his movements, making Saul&#8217;s surveillance less likely (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;&#8230;hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s urgency&#8212;&#8220;hurry&#8221;&#8212;acknowledges real danger: Saul&#8217;s hostility is escalating (<a href="/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9-10</a>; 20:30-33).<p>&#8226; Returning to the same hiding spot shows the reliability of a proven refuge, echoing <a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>: &#8220;You are my hiding place.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;The day this trouble began&#8221; points back to Saul&#8217;s earlier attempt on David&#8217;s life (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10-12</a>). Remembering past threats keeps David vigilant yet assured of God&#8217;s continued rescue (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s obedience to Jonathan, his covenant brother (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3-4</a>), illustrates submission to godly counsel (<a href="/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and remain beside the stone Ezel</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;&#8230;and remain beside the stone Ezel.&#8217; &#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Remain&#8221; underscores steadfastness; David is to stay put until Jonathan signals him (<a href="/1_samuel/20-20.htm">1 Samuel 20:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; A fixed landmark&#8212;the stone Ezel&#8212;provides precision.

The Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac here interpret rather than translate, "on the third day thou will be missed the more." "It did not matter," writes the Dean, "whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him."<p><span class= "bld">When the business was in hand.</span>--The expression, <span class= "ital">b'yom hamma?seh, </span>rendered in our version by "when the business was <span class= "ital">in hand," </span>is one hard to understand.
