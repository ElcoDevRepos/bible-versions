In biblical context, the staff represents authority and leadership, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>). David's use of the staff highlights his role as a shepherd, a humble beginning that foreshadows his future leadership as king. The staff also signifies reliance on God's provision rather than human weaponry.<p><b>selected five smooth stones from the brook</b><br>The choice of five stones may symbolize preparedness and faith, as David only needed one to defeat Goliath. The smooth stones, shaped by water, suggest the refining process of God's creation. The brook likely refers to the Valley of Elah, a geographical location where the battle took place. This act demonstrates David's practical wisdom and trust in God's guidance, as he chose stones that would fly true from his sling.<p><b>and put them in the pouch of his shepherd&#8217;s bag</b><br>The shepherd's bag, or scrip, was a simple leather pouch used to carry provisions. This detail emphasizes David's identity as a shepherd, contrasting with the armor and weapons of a warrior. It reflects the biblical theme of God using the humble and lowly to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>.<p><b>And with his sling in hand</b><br>The sling was a common weapon for shepherds, used to protect the flock from predators. It required skill and precision, attributes David had honed during his time as a shepherd. The sling symbolizes faith and reliance on God rather than conventional means of warfare. This foreshadows the spiritual battles believers face, where faith is the primary weapon (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>).<p><b>he approached the Philistine</b><br>David's approach to Goliath demonstrates courage and faith in God's deliverance. The Philistines were a formidable enemy, often at odds with Israel. David's confrontation with Goliath is a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, as both faced seemingly insurmountable foes with divine assistance.

David stepped onto the battlefield confident that the same Lord who protected his flock would now protect Israel.<p>&#8226; Like Moses&#8217; staff that God used to part the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>) or to bring water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-5.htm">Exodus 17:5-6</a>), this ordinary stick became an instrument through which the Lord would display His power.

Obedience is expressed by faithfully using the gifts and experiences God has already provided.<p>&#8226; The brook was a place of constant flowing water, naturally polishing the stones for accuracy and speed. In the same way, God shapes believers through daily, often unnoticed, experiences so that they are ready when a public challenge arises (<a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Though only one stone would be needed (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>), taking five shows preparedness without presumption. Faith trusts God while still planning wisely (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Later Scripture records four other giants from Gath who fell (<a href="/2_samuel/21-18.htm">2 Samuel 21:18-22</a>).

Nothing about this scene is theatrical; it is everyday faithfulness meeting an extraordinary moment (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The shepherd&#8217;s bag contrasts sharply with Goliath&#8217;s massive armor and shield (<a href="/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5-7</a>). Salvation does not come by human strength but &#8220;from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By keeping the stones close at hand, David demonstrated readiness. Believers are called to keep the word of God hidden in the heart (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>), ready to be applied when spiritual battles arise (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine</b><p>&#8226; David moved toward the enemy, not away, acting on the conviction he had just voiced: &#8220;The battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). True faith advances in obedience, confident that God will honor His promises (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The sling, when skillfully used, was a formidable weapon (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). God often pairs divine power with human responsibility; David had practiced, and now the Spirit amplified his skill for kingdom purposes.<p>&#8226; Approaching the Philistine publicly testified to Israel&#8212;and to the watching nations&#8212;that the living God is unrivaled (<a href="/joshua/4-24.htm">Joshua 4:24</a>). The scene foreshadows Christ, who stepped forward to conquer our ultimate enemies&#8212;sin and death&#8212;on our behalf (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every detail of <a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a> highlights how God uses ordinary tools, practiced skills, and prepared hearts to accomplish extraordinary deliverance. David&#8217;s staff, stones, pouch, and sling showcase a faith that rests in the Lord&#8217;s power while responsibly employing what He provides. The verse invites believers to trust Scripture&#8217;s promise that victory belongs to God and to step forward&#8212;humbly, courageously, and ready&#8212;to face whatever giants stand in the way of His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">And he took his staff in his hand.</span>--It was a true stroke of military genius in David, this determination of his to fight only with the weapons, weak and unimportant though they seemed, with which he was familiar, and in the use of which he was so skilful; nor was the issue of the combat, now he had resolved to use the sling, even doubtful. It has been well said he was like one armed with a rifle, while his enemy had only a spear and a sword, and if only he could take sure aim the result was absolutely certain.<p>Wordsworth, again, on the words "chose him five smooth stones out of the brook," refers to Augustine's Commentary, who finds here a deep mystical signification. It is an admirable specimen of the Patristic School of Exposition, which, although quaint, and not unfrequently "far-fetched," will always, and with good reason, possess great power over the minds of the earnest and devout student. "So our Divine David, the Good Shepherd of Bethlehem, when He went forth at the temptation to meet Satan--our ghostly Goliath--chose <span class= "ital">five stones </span>out of the brook. He took the five books of Moses out of the flowing stream of Judaism. He took what was solid out of what was fluid. He took what was permanent out of what was transitory. He took what was moral and perpetual out of what was ceremonial and temporary. He took stones out of a brook, and with one of these He overthrew Satan. All Christ's answers to the tempter are <span class= "ital">moral </span>precepts, taken from <span class= "ital">one </span>Book of the Law (Deuteronomy), and He prefaced His replies with the same words, '<span class= "ital">It is written;' </span>and with this sling and stone of Scripture He laid our Goliath low, and He has taught us by His example how we may also vanquish the tempter."
