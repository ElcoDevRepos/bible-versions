This action demonstrates David's determination and focus on the task at hand, undeterred by familial opposition. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects the theme of perseverance in the face of discouragement, as seen in other figures like Joseph and Moses. David's turning away can also be seen as a foreshadowing of his future leadership, where he often had to make decisions independent of others' opinions.<p><b>and asked about the offer</b><br>David's inquiry about the offer shows his interest in the reward for defeating Goliath, which included wealth, the king's daughter in marriage, and tax exemption for his family. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where such rewards were significant incentives. It also highlights David's practical nature and his understanding of the stakes involved. Theologically, this can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of counting the cost before undertaking a task (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>).<p><b>and those people answered him just as the first ones had answered</b><br>The repetition of the answer indicates the consistency of the message about the reward, emphasizing its importance and the seriousness of the challenge. This consistency can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging promises, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. The people's response also underscores the widespread fear and reluctance among the Israelites, contrasting with David's faith and courage. This sets the stage for David's role as a type of Christ, who also faced opposition and disbelief but remained steadfast in His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd who would later become King of Israel.
