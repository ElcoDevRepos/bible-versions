He had previously selected five smooth stones from a brook, demonstrating his reliance on God rather than conventional weapons. This act reflects the biblical principle of using what God has provided, as seen in the story of Moses and his staff (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>).<p><b>took out a stone</b><br>The stone represents the seemingly insignificant tools God uses to achieve His purposes. In biblical times, stones were common weapons for shepherds, highlighting David's background and experience. This choice of weapon underscores the theme of God using the humble and lowly to confound the mighty, as echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>and slung it</b><br>The sling was a simple yet effective weapon, requiring skill and precision. David's use of the sling demonstrates his confidence and trust in God, as well as his own abilities honed as a shepherd. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who used seemingly weak means (His death on the cross) to defeat sin and death.<p><b>striking the Philistine on the forehead</b><br>The forehead was a vulnerable spot, and David's precise aim signifies divine guidance. The Philistine, Goliath, represents the enemies of God's people, and his defeat symbolizes God's power over evil. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over Satan, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>.<p><b>The stone sank into his forehead</b><br>The stone sinking into Goliath's forehead indicates the totality of God's victory. It was not merely a superficial wound but a decisive blow. This imagery parallels the crushing of Satan's head by Christ, fulfilling the promise of redemption and victory over sin.<p><b>and he fell facedown on the ground</b><br>Goliath's fall facedown is significant, as it mirrors the posture of submission and defeat. In ancient Near Eastern culture, falling facedown was a sign of humiliation and surrender. This event prefigures the ultimate submission of all powers and authorities to Christ, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, the future king of Israel, who demonstrates faith and courage by confronting Goliath with only a sling and a stone.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A Philistine giant and warrior who defies the armies of Israel, representing the challenges and opposition faced by God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>An ancient people and frequent adversaries of Israel, symbolizing the worldly forces that oppose God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_elah.htm">The Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The battlefield where the confrontation between David and Goliath takes place, representing the spiritual battlegrounds in our lives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sling_and_stone.htm">The Sling and Stone</a></b><br>Simple tools used by David, symbolizing the power of God working through humble means to achieve victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>David's confidence in God allowed him to face Goliath without fear.

But the head-pieces of the armour then do not appear to have possessed "visors;" the face was covered with the heavy shield, which was borne, we are told (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm" title="And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.">1Samuel 17:7</a>), before him. No doubt the Philistine, utterly despising his youthful "unarmed" antagonist, advanced towards him without using, as was customary, the face protection of the shield.<p>Slinging stones had been brought among the Israelites to an extraordinary perfection.
