The term "the LORD's anointed" refers to someone consecrated by God, in this case, King Saul, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). David's refusal to harm Saul demonstrates his reverence for God's authority and timing, acknowledging that it is God's prerogative to remove Saul from kingship, not his own. This respect for divine anointing is echoed in David's earlier encounter with Saul in the cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). The concept of "the LORD's anointed" also foreshadows the ultimate Anointed One, Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Messiah, meaning "Anointed One" in Hebrew.<p><b>Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head,</b><br>The spear and water jug symbolize Saul's vulnerability and David's ability to take his life, yet choosing not to. The spear, a weapon of war, represents Saul's power and authority, while the water jug signifies life and sustenance, especially in the arid wilderness of Ziph where this event occurs. By taking these items, David demonstrates his power over Saul without resorting to violence, proving his loyalty and righteousness. This act serves as a tangible proof of David's integrity when he later confronts Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/26-22.htm">1 Samuel 26:22</a>). The geographical setting in the wilderness of Ziph, a desolate area, highlights the harsh conditions David endured while fleeing from Saul.<p><b>and let us go.&#8221;</b><br>David's decision to leave peacefully underscores his trust in God's justice and timing. This action aligns with biblical principles of leaving vengeance to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) and living peaceably with others. David's restraint and wisdom in handling the situation reflect his character as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This moment also prefigures the teachings of Jesus, who advocated for turning the other cheek and loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39, 44</a>). David's leadership and reliance on God set a precedent for future kings of Israel and provide a model of godly conduct for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is being pursued by King Saul.
