In the context of ancient Israel, peace was not merely the absence of conflict but a state of wholeness and well-being. Jonathan's blessing of peace is significant given the tension and danger David faces from King Saul. It reflects Jonathan's genuine care and the divine favor he wishes upon David.<p><b>for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD,</b><br>Swearing in the name of the LORD underscores the solemnity and sacredness of their covenant. In ancient Israel, oaths made in God's name were binding and inviolable, reflecting a deep commitment to truth and faithfulness. This covenant is not just a personal agreement but one that invokes divine witness and accountability.<p><b>saying, &#8216;May the LORD be a witness between you and me,</b><br>The invocation of the LORD as a witness highlights the seriousness of their agreement. In biblical times, calling upon God as a witness was a way to ensure that both parties remained faithful to their promises. This reflects the understanding that God is omnipresent and omniscient, aware of all human actions and intentions.<p><b>and between your descendants and mine forever.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase extends the covenant beyond Jonathan and David to their descendants, indicating a perpetual bond. It reflects the biblical theme of generational blessings and curses, where the actions and covenants of one generation impact future ones. This also foreshadows the enduring legacy of David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David.<p><b>Then David got up and departed,</b><br>David's departure marks a pivotal moment in his life, as he leaves behind the safety of Jonathan's friendship and enters a period of exile and danger. This action signifies a step of faith and trust in God's protection and plan, despite the immediate threat from Saul.<p><b>and Jonathan went back into the city.</b><br>Jonathan's return to the city, where his father Saul reigns, highlights his difficult position. He remains loyal to David while still being part of Saul's household. This reflects the tension between familial duty and spiritual conviction, a recurring theme in Scripture where believers must navigate their allegiance to God amidst challenging circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

The verse teaches that true peace and covenant love rest on God&#8217;s unchanging faithfulness, shaping both present actions and future generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">Go in peace.--</span>The abruptness of the closing words is most natural, and accords with the evident deep emotion of the speaker. David's heart was too full to reply to his friend's words; blinded with tears, he seems to have hurried away speechless.<p>"We may indeed wonder at the delicacy of feeling and the gentleness of the sentiments which these two men in those old rough times entertained for one another. No ancient writer has set before us so noble an example of a heartfelt, unselfish, and thoroughly human state of feeling, and none has described friendship with such entire truth in all its relations, and with such complete and profound knowledge of the human heart."--<span class= "ital">Phillipson, </span>quoted by Payne Smith.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
