This approach also indicates Saul's growing insecurity and indirect methods, as he sought to manipulate situations to his advantage. The use of servants highlights the king's authority and the social stratification of the time.<p><b>&#8220;Speak to David privately</b><br>David, a young shepherd who had gained fame by defeating Goliath, was becoming increasingly popular. Saul's request for a private conversation suggests a level of secrecy and manipulation, as Saul's intentions were not entirely genuine. This reflects the political intrigue common in royal courts, where private conversations could be used to sway opinions or set traps.<p><b>and tell him, &#8216;Behold, the king is pleased with you,</b><br>Saul's statement of pleasure is ironic, given his underlying jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity. This duplicity is a recurring theme in Saul's interactions with David. The phrase also highlights the importance of royal favor in ancient Israel, where the king's approval could significantly impact one's social and political standing.<p><b>and all his servants love you.</b><br>David's favor among Saul's servants underscores his charisma and leadership qualities, which were evident even at a young age. This popularity among the king's court contrasts with Saul's growing paranoia and fear of losing his throne. The love of the servants for David foreshadows his future as a beloved king of Israel.<p><b>Now therefore, become his son-in-law.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Saul's offer for David to become his son-in-law by marrying his daughter Michal was a strategic move. In ancient cultures, marriage alliances were often used to secure political loyalty and strengthen familial ties. However, Saul's offer was also a ploy to place David in dangerous situations, hoping he would fall in battle against the Philistines.

We cannot suppose that Saul first spoke to David himself, and then told his servants to coax him, as this would also require us to suppose that when offered her by Saul, David refused Michal in marriage. But we may well believe that he was displeased at having been deceived, and that the renewed proposal of marriage with one of the king's daughters had to be made carefully, as he might naturally think that there was danger of his being cajoled a second time. David replies, in fact, very discreetly, saying that to be the king's son-in-law was indeed a great honour, but that he was too poor to provide a sufficient dowry. Strictly the promises given in <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a> bound Saul to give her without dowry; but it appears quite plainly from David's words that he had lost Merab because not able to purchase her as Adriel had done.
