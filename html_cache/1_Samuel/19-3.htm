The field setting suggests a private and neutral location, away from the palace's political tensions. Fields were common meeting places in ancient Israel, often used for discussions and agreements (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>). Jonathan's willingness to stand beside his father shows his loyalty to both Saul and David, highlighting his role as a peacemaker. This act of mediation reflects the biblical principle of seeking peace and reconciliation (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>so I can ask about you</b><br>Jonathan's plan to inquire about David shows his commitment to understanding Saul's intentions. This reflects the biblical theme of seeking truth and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2-5</a>). Jonathan's approach is cautious and strategic, aiming to protect David while respecting his father's authority. The act of asking also signifies the importance of communication and discernment in resolving conflicts, a principle echoed in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>.<p><b>And if I find out anything, I will tell you.</b><br>Jonathan's promise to inform David demonstrates his loyalty and friendship, which is a central theme in their relationship (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-4</a>). This assurance of transparency and honesty is crucial in building trust, a value emphasized throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>). Jonathan's actions foreshadow the protective and intercessory role of Christ, who reveals truth and mediates on behalf of believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
