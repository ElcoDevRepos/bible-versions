Childlessness was often seen as a divine judgment or curse, adding to her emotional turmoil. Her distress is compounded by the taunting of Peninnah, her husband's other wife, who had children. This reflects the polygamous practices of the time, which often led to familial strife, as seen in other biblical accounts like Jacob, Leah, and Rachel.<p><b>Hannah prayed to the LORD</b><br>Hannah's response to her distress is to turn to prayer, demonstrating her faith and reliance on God. This act of prayer is significant, as it shows her belief in God's power to change her situation. The LORD, or Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, emphasizing a personal relationship. Her prayer is a model of earnest supplication, similar to other biblical figures who sought God's intervention, such as David in the Psalms.<p><b>and wept with many tears</b><br>Her weeping indicates the depth of her sorrow and the sincerity of her prayer. Tears in the Bible often accompany heartfelt prayer and repentance, as seen in the stories of Hezekiah and Peter. This emotional expression underscores the human experience of suffering and the biblical encouragement to bring such burdens before God. Hannah's tears also foreshadow the eventual joy and fulfillment she will experience, paralleling the biblical theme of mourning turning into joy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who is deeply distressed due to her inability to bear children.

Scripture records that she was barren (<a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm">1 Samuel 1:2</a>), mocked by Peninnah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>), and misunderstood by her husband (<a href="/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word never minimizes sorrow. <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Personal anguish does not negate faith; it often exposes it. Job poured out grief (<a href="/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20&#8211;26</a>), yet the narrative calls him blameless (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today may face seasons of bitterness&#8212;unanswered prayers, family conflict, health fears&#8212;but the Bible consistently presents such valleys as opportunities to meet the Lord more intimately (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hannah prayed to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hannah prayed to the LORD&#8221;&#8212;she ran toward God, not away from Him. <a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a> urges, &#8220;Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Her prayer shows that grief can coexist with worship. <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> commands, &#8220;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; She addressed &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; using His covenant name (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), anchoring her plea in the character of the God who keeps promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Persistent, personal, honest prayer remains the believer&#8217;s lifeline.

Honest prayer&#8212;captured in words and tears&#8212;invites divine comfort and sets the stage for God&#8217;s timely answer. Like Hannah, we can trust that the Lord hears, cares, and will turn present sorrow into future praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She... prayed unto the LORD.</span> Kneeling down in the inner court, but within sight of Eli, whose throne in the porch probably overlooked the whole inner space, Hannah prays unto "Jehovah of Sabaoth" for a male child. Her humility appears in her thrice calling herself Jehovah's handmaid; her earnestness in the threefold repetition of the entreaty that Jehovah would look on her, and remember her, and not forget her. With her prayer she also makes a twofold vow in case her request is granted. The son given her is, first, to serve not for a stipulated number of years, as was the law with the Levites (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>), but for life; and, secondly, he is to be a Nazarite. We gather from <a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a> that Moses found this singular institution in existence, and only regulated it, and admitted it into the circle of established and legalised ordinances. Essentially it was a consecration to God, a holy priesthood, but not a sacrificing priesthood nor one by right of birth, as the Aaronic, but personal, and either for a limited period, or for life. During the continuance of the vow, a Nazarite might <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> partake of no produce of the vine, signifying thereby abstinence from self-indulgence and carnal pleasure. He might <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> take no part in mourning for the dead, even though they were his nearest relatives, because his holier duties raised him above the ordinary joys and sorrows, the cares and occupations of every day life. Lastly, no razor might come upon his head, the free growing hair being at once the distinctive mark by which all men would recognise his sacred calling, and also a sign that he was not bound by the usual customs of life. By Hannah's first vow Samuel was devoted to service in the sanctuary, by the second to a holy consecrated life. This institution remained in existence unto our Lord's days; for John the Baptist was also consecrated to God as a Nazarite by his mother, though not as Samuel, also given to minister in the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In her bitter distress,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4751.htm">Strong's 4751: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bitter, bitterness, bitterly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hannah prayed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7791;&#183;pal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6419.htm">Strong's 6419: </a> </span><span class="str2">To judge, to intercede, pray</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and wept</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1499;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1058.htm">Strong's 1058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To weep, to bemoan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with many tears.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#7687;&#183;keh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1058.htm">Strong's 1058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To weep, to bemoan</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">OT History: 1 Samuel 1:10 She was in bitterness of soul and (1Sa iSam 1 Sam i sa) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Samuel 1:9"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 1:9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Samuel 1:11"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 1:11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
