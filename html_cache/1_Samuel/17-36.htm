This experience demonstrates his courage and reliance on God's strength. In the ancient Near East, lions and bears were common threats to livestock, and shepherds needed to be brave and resourceful. David's victories over these animals foreshadow his ability to confront Goliath, emphasizing that God equips those He calls for His purposes. This phrase also highlights the theme of God preparing His servants through seemingly mundane tasks for greater challenges.<p><b>this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them,</b><br>David refers to Goliath as "uncircumcised," indicating that Goliath is outside the covenant community of Israel. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). By calling Goliath "uncircumcised," David underscores the Philistine's lack of relationship with God and positions him as an enemy of God's people. This phrase also reflects David's confidence that God will deliver Goliath into his hands just as He did with the wild animals, reinforcing the idea that God is sovereign over all adversaries.<p><b>for he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221;</b><br>David's motivation for confronting Goliath is rooted in his zeal for God's honor. The Philistine's defiance is not merely against Israel but against God Himself, who is described as "the living God." This title emphasizes God's active presence and power, contrasting with the lifeless idols worshiped by other nations. David's perspective aligns with the biblical theme that God fights for His people and that His name should be revered among the nations. This phrase also prefigures Christ, who zealously defended His Father's honor and defeated the ultimate enemy, sin and death, through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel.

Shepherding was never a mild, pastoral pastime for him&#8212;it was a training ground where God proved His faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Every lion or bear that stalked the sheep exposed David to lethal danger, but each victory deepened his conviction that &#8220;The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>).<p>&#8226; God often uses smaller-scale struggles to prepare His people for larger confrontations; being &#8220;faithful in very little&#8221; leads to faithfulness &#8220;in much&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; These earlier rescues also echo God&#8217;s pattern with other servants&#8212;Samson &#8220;tore the lion apart&#8230; because the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5-6</a>). David sees the same Spirit-empowered protection at work in his own story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them</b><p>David draws a stark line between covenant insiders and outsiders. Circumcision was the physical sign of belonging to God&#8217;s people (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>). Goliath, lacking that sign, stands alone against God and His covenant promises.<p>&#8226; By calling Goliath &#8220;uncircumcised,&#8221; David isn&#8217;t just insulting him; he is underscoring that the giant has no covenant claim to God&#8217;s protection, unlike Israel.<p>&#8226; Similar language from Jonathan appears earlier: &#8220;Perhaps the LORD will act on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). David shares the same conviction&#8212;size and weaponry do not decide the outcome, covenant loyalty does.<p>&#8226; Past victories over predators assured David that future threats, no matter how intimidating, fall under the same divine jurisdiction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he has defied the armies of the living God</b><p>The heart of David&#8217;s outrage is not personal honor but God&#8217;s reputation. Goliath&#8217;s taunts (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10, 26</a>) are direct challenges to &#8220;the living God,&#8221; the One who acts, speaks, and rescues.<p>&#8226; The Old Testament repeatedly shows God defending His name when pagan powers mock Him&#8212;Hezekiah prayed, &#8220;listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>), and the Lord answered decisively.<p>&#8226; David views Israel&#8217;s troops as &#8220;the armies of the living God,&#8221; not merely a national militia. Because they belong to the living God, their humiliation is God&#8217;s concern.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s zeal mirrors later psalms: &#8220;My soul thirsts for God, for the living God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>). For him, God&#8217;s honor is personal and paramount, fueling courage far beyond natural bravado.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a> shows David linking God&#8217;s past faithfulness with present courage. Having experienced divine rescue from lions and bears, he reasons that the uncircumcised Philistine&#8212;outside God&#8217;s covenant and openly mocking God&#8212;must fall just as surely. David&#8217;s confidence rests not in skill or youth but in the living God whose name cannot be defied with impunity. The verse invites believers to recall their own history with God, recognize the covenant privileges they possess, and face new giants with unwavering trust in the same faithful Deliverer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">The lion and the bear.</span>--The lion and the bear were, in the days of Saul, common in Palestine; the country then was densely wooded.
