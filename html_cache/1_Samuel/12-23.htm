Samuel, as a prophet and judge, distinguishes his role from that of the people. His leadership is not just political but deeply spiritual, emphasizing his personal dedication to God and the people of Israel.<p><b>far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD</b><br>Samuel acknowledges that failing to fulfill his duties would be a sin against God. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders are accountable to God for their actions (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>). It underscores the seriousness of spiritual leadership and the moral obligation to remain faithful to God's calling.<p><b>by ceasing to pray for you.</b><br>Prayer is seen as an essential duty of spiritual leaders. Samuel's commitment to intercession highlights the importance of prayer in maintaining a relationship with God and seeking His guidance and mercy for the people. This is consistent with the New Testament teaching on the priesthood of all believers and the call to pray for one another (<a href="/1_timothy/2.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>).<p><b>And I will continue to teach you</b><br>Samuel's role as a teacher is crucial. Teaching the people the ways of God is a central theme throughout the Bible, seen in the roles of Moses, the prophets, and ultimately Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate teacher (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). This reflects the ongoing need for spiritual instruction and guidance.<p><b>the good and right way.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes moral and ethical instruction according to God's standards. The "good and right way" is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the path of righteousness and obedience to God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a>). It foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who declared Himself the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and calls believers to follow His example.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

His leadership is not abstract but rooted in his own walk with God. Like Joshua&#8217;s declaration, &#8220;But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), Samuel sets his footing first, signaling that spiritual influence flows from a leader&#8217;s private loyalty. His &#8220;me&#8221; reminds us that every believer is responsible for his or her own faithfulness before offering guidance to others (<a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD</b><p>Samuel treats prayerlessness as sin, not merely neglect. Scripture shows sins of omission carry weight: &#8220;If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn&#8217;t do it, it is sin for them&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>). The prophet&#8217;s conscience is tuned to God&#8217;s holiness; any failure to intercede would be a breach of duty to the One who commanded, &#8220;Pray continually&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>). In Samuel&#8217;s view, abandoning prayer is rebellion akin to Saul&#8217;s later disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by ceasing to pray for you</b><p>Intercession stands at the heart of shepherding.<p>&#8226; Moses modeled it when he pleaded, &#8220;Yet now, if You would only forgive their sin&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s restoration came as he &#8220;prayed for his friends&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul followed the pattern: &#8220;We always thank God... when we pray for you&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>).<p>The flock may forget, but the shepherd must not. By continuing to pray, Samuel becomes a living bridge between Israel&#8217;s need and God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will continue to teach you</b><p>Prayer alone is not enough; instruction accompanies intercession.

David later sings, &#8220;Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>). The &#8220;way&#8221; points ultimately to Christ&#8212;&#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Walking that way brings life (<a href="/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>) and shields from ruin (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). Samuel&#8217;s teaching is not opinion but revelation that lights Israel&#8217;s steps (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s words in <a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a> weave prayer, teaching, and personal holiness into one seamless calling. He refuses to let prayerlessness offend God, commits to ongoing instruction, and anchors everything in his own faithful stance. The verse challenges every believer to stand firm personally, intercede persistently, and guide others consistently along the good and right way revealed in Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Moreover, as for me.</span>--"In this he sets a glorious example to all rulers, showing them that they should not be led astray by the ingratitude of their subordinates or subjects; and give up on that account all interest in their welfare, but should rather persevere all the more in their anxiety for them."--<span class= "ital">Berleb. Bible</span>, quoted in Lange. Moses and Samuel, wrote S. Gregory, are especially brought forward by the Prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.">Jeremiah 15:1</a>) as having extraordinary power with Him, and why? because they prayed for their enemies. Samuel's impassioned answer when the Elders asked his prayers, "Pray for you!" God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you.<p><span class= "bld">I will teach you.</span>--The old man felt that in the future, although his powers as Judge were not abrogated yet, there would be, comparatively speaking, save on special occasions, but little opportunity for their exercise. In the presence of the regular authority of a king surrounded by armed men, such authority as he had wielded as Judge over the hearts of Israel must fall into abeyance.<p>But one, and that a still higher office, still remained to him untouched by the great constitutional change that had passed over Israel--<span class= "ital">that of prophet. </span>In this sphere, while he lived, he said he would work ceaselessly on; and the words he used on this solemn occasion tell out to all ages that the true function of the prophet or the preacher of the Eternal is to teach the people the good and the right way; and Samuel's own life of brave self-denial and noble self-effacement showed men that this teaching must be pressed home by something more than mere words. "Only a Samuel could thus quit office, proudly challenging all to convict him of one single injustice in his past career; and by the act of resignation gaining, not losing, greatness. No longer judge and ruler, but simple prophet, he is able now to discourse with greater freedom of the monarchy about to be introduced, and he seizes the moment to cast a more distant glance into all the past and future of the community."--Ewald: <span class= "ital">History of Israel, </span>Book III., 1-3.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid,</span> Hebrew, "Far be it from me." <span class="cmt_word">That I should sin... in ceasing to pray for you.</span> In no character of the Old Testament does this duty of intercessory prayer stand forward so prominently as in Samuel (see ver. 19);
