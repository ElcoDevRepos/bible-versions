The Amalekites first attacked the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), and God commanded their destruction as a consequence. Saul's mission was a direct command from God through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15:1-3</a>). This act of striking down the Amalekites was meant to fulfill God's judgment against them, highlighting the theme of divine justice and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>all the way from Havilah to Shur</b><br>Havilah and Shur are geographical markers that define the extent of Saul's campaign. Havilah is often associated with a region rich in resources, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a> as part of the land surrounding the Garden of Eden. Shur is a desert region east of Egypt, frequently mentioned in the context of the Israelites' wanderings (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). The mention of these locations indicates the comprehensive nature of Saul's campaign, covering a vast area and emphasizing the thoroughness expected in carrying out God's command.<p><b>which is east of Egypt</b><br>This phrase situates the campaign geographically, providing a clear boundary for the area of conflict. The reference to Egypt is significant, as it recalls Israel's history of bondage and deliverance. The Amalekites' location east of Egypt also underscores their role as perennial adversaries of Israel, often attacking from the desert regions. This geographical detail serves to remind readers of the broader narrative of Israel's journey from slavery to nationhood, with the Amalekites as a recurring obstacle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
