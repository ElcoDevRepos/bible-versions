This moment follows a tense encounter in the cave at En Gedi, where David spared Saul's life, demonstrating his respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed king. The oath underscores David's integrity and commitment to peace, even with an adversary. This act of mercy and honor foreshadows the teachings of Jesus on loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) and highlights David as a type of Christ, who also showed mercy and forgiveness.<p><b>Then Saul returned home,</b><br>Saul's return home indicates a temporary cessation of hostilities. This moment of peace is significant in the narrative of Saul and David, as it shows a brief respite in Saul's relentless pursuit of David. Historically, Saul's return to Gibeah, his royal residence, suggests a withdrawal from the immediate threat he perceived in David. This action reflects the unstable nature of Saul's reign and his internal conflict, as he acknowledges David's righteousness yet continues to view him as a rival.<p><b>but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</b><br>David's decision to go to the stronghold, likely referring to the wilderness strongholds in the region of Judah, indicates his continued caution and strategic acumen. The stronghold represents a place of refuge and security, essential for David and his men as they navigate the dangers posed by Saul's unpredictable behavior. This movement also symbolizes David's reliance on God's protection and guidance, as he waits for God's timing to ascend to the throne. The stronghold can be seen as a metaphor for God's protection, as echoed in Psalms attributed to David, such as <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, where God is described as a fortress and deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

The Law required a vow to be kept once made.<p>&#8226; By swearing, David demonstrates respect for the king God had anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This oath will later shape David&#8217;s actions, sparing Jonathan&#8217;s line even when political convenience might suggest otherwise (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later underscores the integrity expected of God&#8217;s people: &#8220;Let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and your &#8216;No,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>). David models that integrity here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Saul returned home</b><p>The spear-throwing king suddenly heads back to Gibeah, ending the immediate threat.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s emotion-filled confession (&#8220;You are more righteous than I,&#8221; v.17) looks sincere, yet history shows it is short-lived (<a href="/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often records short-term repentance that doesn&#8217;t reach the heart (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27-30</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>). Saul&#8217;s return home is a pause, not a permanent change.<p>&#8226; God, however, is still using Saul&#8217;s vacillations to train David in patience and faith (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but David and his men went up to the stronghold</b><p>David does not trail after Saul; he heads for the wilderness refuge&#8212;likely En-gedi&#8217;s rugged cliffs or the hill country of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith is not naivety. &#8220;The prudent see danger and take refuge&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>). David trusts God yet exercises wise caution.<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;stronghold&#8221; also points to David&#8217;s ultimate security: &#8220;The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Even while occupying physical strongholds, his real shelter is the Lord.<p>&#8226; Leading his men there keeps morale and safety intact, and it readies them for the next stage of God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s oath reveals a heart committed to truth and covenant faithfulness; Saul&#8217;s retreat exposes a repentance that fades; David&#8217;s move to the stronghold illustrates faith paired with prudence. Together the verse teaches that God-honoring integrity, patient discernment, and wise refuge belong side by side in the life of those who trust the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And David sware unto Saul.</span>--The generous son of Jesse at once complied with Saul's curious request, and for a time, at least, the persecution and pursuit of David ceased. Stricken with remorse, the gloomy king left him to himself; no word, however, seems to have passed as to restoring the exile to his home or rank. Bishop Wordsworth quotes here a characteristic passage from one of Chrysostom's eloquent homilies, in which the Patristic method of allegorising all these famous scenes of Old Testament history is well exemplified.<p>"Meditate on the example of David, and do thou imitate it: imitate it in his self-control and in his love of his enemy. The cave in which he was became like a Christian Church, and he became like a Christian bishop, who first preaches a sermon and then offers the sacrifice of the altar.<p>"So David preached a sermon by his example, and offered a true sacrifice--the spiritual sacrifice of himself and of his own anger; he became as it were a priest, a sacrifice, and an altar, and having offered his victims, he gained a glorious victory."--<span class= "ital">St. Chrysostom, </span>tom. 4, p. 761.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave his oath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
