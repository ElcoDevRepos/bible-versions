This was a significant milestone, marking the child's transition from infancy to early childhood. Weaning was often celebrated as it indicated the child had survived the vulnerable early years. Hannah's decision to wait until Samuel was weaned before fulfilling her vow to dedicate him to the LORD shows her commitment to nurturing him during his formative years.<p><b>Hannah took the boy with her</b><br>Hannah's journey to Shiloh with Samuel was a fulfillment of her vow to God. This act of dedication was a profound expression of faith and obedience. It highlights the importance of vows in the biblical narrative, where making and keeping vows to God was a serious matter (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p><b>along with a three-year-old bull</b><br>The offering of a bull was significant in the sacrificial system of Israel. A three-year-old bull was considered a valuable and substantial offering, indicating Hannah's gratitude and the seriousness of her vow. This offering aligns with the Levitical laws concerning sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-5</a>).<p><b>an ephah of flour</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. The flour was likely intended for a grain offering, which accompanied burnt offerings as a sign of dedication and thanksgiving to God (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>).<p><b>and a skin of wine</b><br>Wine was often used in drink offerings, which were poured out as a libation to the LORD (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). The inclusion of wine with the bull and flour completes the sacrificial offering, symbolizing joy and celebration in fulfilling her vow.<p><b>Though the boy was still young</b><br>Samuel's youth is emphasized to highlight the faith and trust Hannah placed in God. Despite his tender age, Samuel was dedicated to the LORD's service, foreshadowing his future role as a prophet and judge in Israel. This dedication parallels the Nazarite vow, where individuals were set apart for God's service from a young age (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p><b>she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was the central place of worship in Israel before the temple was built in Jerusalem. It housed the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant, making it the spiritual center of the nation (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>). Bringing Samuel to Shiloh signifies his consecration to God's service in the presence of the sacred symbols of Israel's faith. This act prefigures the dedication of Jesus at the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>), drawing a parallel between Samuel and Christ as dedicated servants of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who prayed earnestly for a child and vowed to dedicate him to the Lord.

In biblical culture this usually occurred around age two or three (<a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>). Hannah waited until that moment so her son would be strong enough to serve yet still tender enough to be shaped by the Lord. Her patience echoes the wisdom of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>&#8212;there is &#8220;a time for every purpose.&#8221; By trusting God&#8217;s timing, she honors the vow she made before Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11, 23</a>) without neglecting maternal responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hannah took the boy with her</b><p>Hannah personally brings Samuel to Shiloh, demonstrating that vows are fulfilled best when handled directly, not delegated (<a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>).

Three years suggests maturity and completeness, underscoring the total devotion Hannah intends for Samuel. Like Elijah&#8217;s three-year-old sacrifice on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33</a>), this offering proclaims, &#8220;The LORD&#8212;He is God!&#8221; Generosity always accompanies true worship (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An ephah of flour</b><p>An ephah&#8212;about thirty pounds&#8212;matches the grain portion that accompanies a large animal sacrifice (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>). This flour points to Christ as the &#8220;grain of wheat&#8221; who would give His life (<a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>). Hannah&#8217;s abundant measure affirms that God deserves more than minimum compliance; He is worthy of lavish obedience (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A skin of wine</b><p>Wine completed the drink offering (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5, 10</a>).

Hannah&#8217;s inclusion of wine shows her approach is festive, not forced&#8212;serving God is a delight, not a duty (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though the boy was still young</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s youth makes the surrender more striking. <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a> pictures a child leading in God&#8217;s peaceable kingdom; <a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-7</a> reminds that age does not limit divine calling.

Bringing Samuel there fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, which commanded worship &#8220;at the place the LORD your God will choose.&#8221; Hannah is not abandoning her son; she is positioning him in God&#8217;s presence, much like Mary later presents Jesus in the temple (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>). The scene anticipates Samuel&#8217;s lifelong ministry: &#8220;The boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a> showcases surrendered worship.

Her example invites believers to give back the very blessings God bestows, confident that whatever is laid on His altar is never lost but multiplied for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24, 25) <span class= "bld">With three bullocks . . . And they slew a bullock.</span>--There at first sight seems a discrepancy here, and the LXX. translators seem to have felt it, for they read, instead of "three bullocks," "a bullock of three years old." The true explanation, however, is that the one bullock alluded to in <a href="/1_samuel/1-25.htm" title="And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.">1Samuel 1:25</a> was the burnt offering by which the child was consecrated to the Lord. The other two were the yearly festival offering, the presentation of which being the usual gift, the chronicler did not think it here worth while to mention again.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
