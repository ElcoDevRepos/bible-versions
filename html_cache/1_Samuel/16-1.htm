Samuel's role as a prophet is crucial, as he serves as God's mouthpiece to the people. This divine communication underscores the personal relationship between God and His chosen servants. It also highlights the transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy in Israel.<p><b>How long are you going to mourn for Saul</b><br>Samuel's mourning for Saul reflects his deep disappointment and sorrow over Saul's failure as king. Saul was the first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel himself, and his rejection by God marks a significant turning point. This mourning can be seen as a natural human response to the failure of a leader and the potential instability it brings to the nation.<p><b>since I have rejected him as king over Israel?</b><br>God's rejection of Saul is due to Saul's disobedience and failure to follow God's commands, as seen in previous chapters. This rejection signifies a divine judgment and a shift in leadership. It emphasizes the importance of obedience to God&#8217;s will and foreshadows the rise of a new king who will be "a man after God's own heart" (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><b>Fill your horn with oil and go.</b><br>The horn filled with oil is a symbol of anointing, which is a ritual act of consecration to a holy office. Anointing with oil signifies the empowerment and setting apart of an individual for God's purposes. This act is a precursor to the anointing of David, who will be chosen as the next king.<p><b>I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, is significant as the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ. Jesse, David's father, is introduced here, establishing the Davidic line. This connection to Bethlehem is prophetic, as it aligns with <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretells the birthplace of the Messiah.<p><b>for I have selected from his sons a king for Myself.</b><br>God's choice of a king from Jesse's sons highlights divine sovereignty in leadership selection. Unlike Saul, who was chosen by the people, David is chosen by God. This selection points to God's criteria for leadership, focusing on the heart rather than outward appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). David, as a type of Christ, prefigures the ultimate King, Jesus, who will come from the line of David and fulfill God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who directs the events and chooses leaders according to His divine will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, who anointed Saul as king and is now tasked with anointing a new king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, rejected by God due to his disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>A resident of Bethlehem, father of David, from whose sons God has chosen a new king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>A small town in Judah, significant as the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>God is in control of who leads His people.

In every season, God&#8217;s plans advance, and His people are invited to trust His wisdom and act on His clear word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">How long wilt thou mourn for Saul?</span>--The constant references to the influence Saul acquired, and the love and admiration he attracted, is a striking feature in this most ancient Book of Samuel, where the fall and ruin of the first Hebrew king is so pathetically related.<p>Though it tells us how Saul was tried, and found utterly wanting, still the record, which dwells on the evil qualities which ruined the great life, never loses an opportunity of telling how men like Samuel and David mourned for Saul, and how heroes like Jonathan loved the king who <span class= "ital">might </span>have been so great. The ordinary reader of the story, but. for these touches of feeling, would be tempted to condemn with far too sweeping a condemnation the unhappy Saul, whose sun, as far as the world was concerned, set amidst clouds and thick darkness. Is it too much to think that for Saul the punishment ended here? that the bitter suffering caused by the solemn anger of his prophet friend, the gloomy last years of unhappiness and distrust, and the shame and defeat of the last campaign, purged away from the noble soul the scars left by the self-will and disobedience? The Divine Voice, so well-known to the seer, at length roused him from his mourning inactivity. Though that instrument, prepared with so much care, was broken, the work of God for which this instrument was created must be done. If Saul had failed, another must be looked for. and trained to fill the place of the deposed disobedient king.<p><span class= "bld">Fill thine horn with oil.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the oil; </span>probably, as Stanley suggests, the consecrated oil preserved in the Tabernacle at Nob. (On the use to be made of this "sacred oil," see Note on <a href="/1_samuel/16-3.htm" title="And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.">1Samuel 16:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Jesse the Beth-lehemite.</span>--From this day forward the village of Bethlehem obtained a strange notoriety in the annals of the world. David loved the village, where his father, most probably, was the sheik, or head man. "The future king never forgot the flavour," as Stanley graphically reminds us, "of the water of the well of Bethlehem" (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm" title="And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!">1Chronicles 11:17</a>). It was Bethlehem, the cradle of the great ancestor, that was selected in the counsels of the Most High as the birthplace of Jesus Christ.<p>This Jesse was evidently a man of some wealth, Mohammedan tradition speaks of him as one who, in addition to his farming pursuits, was famous for his skill in making hair-cloths and sack-cloths.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long writ thou mourn?</span> The grief of Samuel was prolonged almost to a sinful extent, nor can we wonder at it. We who see Saul's whole career, and know how deeply he fell, are in danger of discrediting his high qualities; but those who were witnesses of his military skill and prowess, and saw him and his heroic son raising the nation from its feebleness and thraldom to might and empire, must have given him an ungrudging admiration. Both David's dirge (<a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19-27</a>) and Samuel's long mourning, and the unqualified obedience which he was able so quickly to extort from a high-spirited people unused to being governed, bear decisive testimony to his powers as a ruler and commander in war. But God now warns Samuel to mourn no longer. Saul's rejection has become final, and God's prophet must sacrifice his personal feelings, and prepare to carry out the purpose indicated in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>. We must not, however, conclude that Samuel's sorrow had only been for Saul personally; there was danger for the whole nation in his conduct. If wilfulness and passion gained in him the upper hand, the band of authority would be loosed, and the old feebleness and anarchy would return, and Israel become even more hopelessly a prey to its former troubles. Samuel, therefore, is to go to Bethlehem and anoint there a son of Jesse. As this place lay at some distance from Ramah, and out of the circuit habitually traversed by Samuel as judge, he probably had but a general knowledge of the family. Evidently he had no acquaintance with David (vers. 11, 12); but as Jesse was a man of wealth and importance, his reputation had probably reached the prophet's ears. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
