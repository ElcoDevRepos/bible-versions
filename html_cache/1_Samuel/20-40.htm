The "equipment" refers to his bow and arrows, which were used in the preceding verses as part of a covert signal to communicate with David. This act of giving his equipment to the boy signifies trust and delegation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a warrior's weapons were personal and significant, often symbolizing strength and status. Jonathan's willingness to part with his equipment underscores his commitment to David's safety over his own status or security. This act also prefigures the selflessness seen in Christ, who laid down His own life for His friends (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Go, take it back to the city.&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan instructs the boy to return to the city, which in this context is likely Gibeah, Saul's capital. This instruction is part of a carefully orchestrated plan to protect David from Saul's wrath. The city represents a place of both political power and potential danger, as Saul's intentions towards David have become increasingly hostile. Jonathan's command to the boy to return alone ensures that David remains hidden and safe. This moment highlights the theme of divine providence and protection, as God uses Jonathan's loyalty to preserve David, who is anointed to be the future king of Israel. This narrative foreshadows the ultimate protection and deliverance found in Christ, who is often seen as the greater David, fulfilling the promises of God to establish an eternal kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

And so they parted, David to begin a life of danger and wandering, while Jonathan returned to the city to be a dutiful son to Saul. Phillipson remarks, "The scenes in this chapter are some of the most affecting presented to us in history, whether in old or modern times, and we may Well wonder at the delicacy of feeling and the gentleness of the sentiments which these two men in those old rough times entertained for one another. No ancient writer has set before us so noble an example of a heart felt, unselfish, and thoroughly human state of feeling, and none has described friendship with such entire truth in all its relations, and with such complete and profound knowledge of the human heart." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
