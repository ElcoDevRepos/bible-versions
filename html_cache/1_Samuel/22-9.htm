The Edomites were often in conflict with Israel, and Doeg's presence in Saul's court suggests a complex relationship between Israel and Edom. His role as a foreigner in Saul's service highlights themes of loyalty and betrayal. Edomites were known for their skills in agriculture and animal husbandry, which may explain Doeg's position as Saul's chief shepherd (<a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>).<p><b>who had stationed himself with Saul&#8217;s servants</b><br>Doeg's presence among Saul's servants suggests he held a position of some authority or trust. This phrase indicates that he was not merely passing by but was intentionally placed or had placed himself in a position to observe and report. This reflects the political tension and suspicion in Saul's court, as Saul was increasingly paranoid about David's rising popularity and perceived threats to his throne.<p><b>answered</b><br>Doeg's response is significant as it shows his willingness to inform on David. His answer is not just a report but a deliberate act that sets in motion a series of tragic events. This reflects the theme of speech and its power, as seen throughout the Bible, where words can lead to life or death (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p><b>I saw the son of Jesse</b><br>Referring to David as "the son of Jesse" rather than by his name may imply a dismissive or derogatory tone, emphasizing David's humble origins. This phrase also connects to the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where the Messiah is referred to as a "shoot from the stump of Jesse," highlighting David's significance in the lineage of Christ.<p><b>come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob</b><br>Ahimelech was the high priest, and Nob was a city of priests, indicating its religious significance. This visit is crucial as it leads to the tragic massacre of the priests by Saul, instigated by Doeg's report. The mention of Ahimelech and Nob underscores the sacredness of the priestly line and the gravity of Saul's actions against them. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's reign and highlights the theme of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/doeg_the_edomite.htm">Doeg the Edomite</a></b><br>A servant of King Saul, known for his betrayal of David and the priests of Nob.

His presence in this council meeting under the tamarisk of Gibeah, among the famous Benjamito chieftains, and the previous notice which speaks of him as the officer superintending the royal herds, indicates that he was a personage of no small importance at the Court of Saul. He occupies too a considerable position in the Psalmodic literature. (See, for instance, Psalms 52)<p>Here he is spoken of as a wicked and unscrupulous character. Jewish tradition tells us this Doeg was skilled in all the learning of his time. Doeg the Edomite, and Ahitophel (whose counsel was as the oracle of God) are represented in the Talmud as the most learned men of their time. "The Holy One, blessed be He! said to wicked Doeg, what hast thou to do to declare my statutes (Psalms 52)? When thou comest to the chapter on murderers and on spreading evil reports, what dost thou make of them?"--<span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 106, Colossians 2.<p>It is strange that this renowned man, whom evidently David looked upon as the evil genius of Saul at the period when he wrote the sad, bitter words of Psalms 52, and spoke of the tongue of this Doeg as being like a sharp razor, and dwelt with singular persistence on the wickedness, falsehood, and calumny of this relentless enemy, should have gone down among the noteworthy Talmudical traditions as "the <span class= "ital">greatest Rabbinist </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the most deeply learned in the Mosaic Law, and in its interpretation) of his time.<p><span class= "bld">Which was set over the servants of Saul.</span>--This statement would be a puzzling one were it the correct rendering. It would be unlikely in the highest degree that Saul would set a foreigner--however able and devoted--over his faithful Benjamite chieftains. The accurate translation is "who stood with the servants of Saul." In <a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm" title="When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)">1Samuel 22:6</a> we read, in the description of the council meeting under the tamarisk of Gibeah, all his servants (that is, his chief dignitaries) stood by (around) him (Saul), and with these, his peers, stood Doeg the Edomite, the hero of the terrible scene which followed.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Then answered Doeg.</span>--"Far better," quaintly writes Seb Schmid, "did Saul's other servants who kept silence." The Edomite's witness had the more effect on Saul because he related no hearsay evidence, but what he had absolutely seen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul.</span> This translation is entirely wrong, nor would Saul's Benjamites have endured to have an Edomite set over them. The verb is that used in ver. 6, and refers simply to Doeg's place in the circle of attendants standing round Saul. The words mean, "Doeg the Edomite, who stood there with the servants of Saul." As chief herdsman he was present as a person of some importance, but far below "the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds." <span class="cmt_word">I saw the son of Jesse,</span> etc. As Saul was in a dangerous state of excite. sent, bordering on insanity, Doeg's statement was probably made with the evil intent of turning the king's suspicions from the courtiers to the priests.
