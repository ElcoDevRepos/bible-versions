Samuel, a key figure in Israel's history, was a prophet, judge, and anointer of kings. His relationship with God was intimate, allowing him to receive direct instructions. This communication underscores the importance of divine guidance in leadership decisions.<p><b>Do not consider his appearance or height</b><br>This instruction challenges the cultural norms of the time, where physical stature and appearance were often equated with leadership potential. Saul, Israel's first king, was chosen partly for his impressive appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>), but his reign was marked by disobedience. This directive serves as a corrective to the previous choice, emphasizing that God's criteria differ from human expectations.<p><b>for I have rejected him</b><br>This refers to Eliab, Jesse's eldest son, whom Samuel initially thought was the chosen one due to his appearance. The rejection highlights God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and His ability to see beyond human judgment. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God choosing the unlikely or overlooked, as seen with David, the youngest son.<p><b>the LORD does not see as man does</b><br>This statement reveals a fundamental theological truth about God's omniscience and His ability to perceive beyond the physical realm. It contrasts human limitations with divine insight, reminding believers that God's understanding and wisdom surpass human comprehension. This theme is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours.<p><b>For man sees the outward appearance</b><br>This observation reflects human nature's tendency to judge based on visible attributes. It serves as a caution against superficial assessments and encourages a deeper evaluation of character and intent. This principle is applicable in various biblical narratives, such as the selection of Gideon (Judges 6) and the calling of the disciples (<a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>).<p><b>but the LORD sees the heart</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the core of a person's being, including their thoughts, intentions, and character. God's focus on the heart underscores His desire for genuine faith and integrity. This concept is central to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized inner purity over external compliance (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>). David, despite his flaws, was described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>), illustrating the importance of inner devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

Scripture often records the LORD speaking directly to correct human reasoning (<a href="/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-4.htm">Jonah 4:4</a>).

God&#8217;s election is sovereign (<a href="/romans/9-15.htm">Romans 9:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejection here does not equate to condemnation of Eliab&#8217;s soul; it simply means he will not be king.
