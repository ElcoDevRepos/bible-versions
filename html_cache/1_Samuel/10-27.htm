In the Hebrew, the term is "sons of Belial," which implies a lack of value or worthiness. This phrase sets the stage for the opposition Saul faces, even as he is anointed king. It reflects a recurring theme in Scripture where God's chosen leaders, like Moses and David, face skepticism and rebellion from their own people.<p><b>&#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects doubt and disbelief in Saul's ability to lead and deliver Israel. It echoes the skepticism often faced by leaders chosen by God, who may not fit the people's expectations. This sentiment is reminiscent of the Israelites' doubt in God's provision and leadership through Moses in the wilderness. It also foreshadows the rejection of Jesus Christ, who was questioned and doubted by many during His earthly ministry.<p><b>So they despised him and brought him no gifts;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, bringing gifts to a new king was a sign of allegiance and respect. The refusal to bring gifts to Saul signifies a rejection of his authority and kingship. This act of contempt is significant in understanding the challenges Saul faces as a leader. It parallels the rejection of Jesus, who was despised and rejected by men, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.<p><b>but Saul remained silent about it.</b><br>Saul's silence can be seen as an act of restraint and wisdom, choosing not to retaliate against his detractors. This response is notable in the context of leadership, where patience and forbearance are often necessary. Saul's silence may also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who, when reviled, did not revile in return, as described in <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>.

This phrase describes people who have no regard for God&#8217;s authority&#8212;like the &#8220;worthless men&#8221; in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a> who despised the priesthood, or the troublemakers of <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a> who led Israel into rebellion. Their presence reminds us that whenever God raises up leadership, opposition will follow (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>). They stand in contrast to those who earlier &#8220;went with Saul, whose hearts God had touched&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>), showing that the real issue is spiritual: hearts either yield to God or resist Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said, &#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221;</b><p>Their question is not curiosity but contempt. By doubting Saul&#8217;s ability, they are actually doubting the God who chose and empowered him (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). Israel had done this before&#8212;questioning Moses&#8217; leadership (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2&#8211;11</a>) and Gideon&#8217;s calling (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>). Centuries later the Nazarene crowd would sneer, &#8220;Is not this the carpenter&#8217;s son?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55&#8211;57</a>), and Jesus&#8217; parable echoed the sentiment: &#8220;We do not want this man to reign over us&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-14.htm">Luke 19:14</a>). Unbelief always asks, &#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221; because it fixes on human limitation instead of divine appointment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they despised him and brought him no gifts</b><p>In the ancient Near East, gifts signified loyalty and honor to a new ruler (<a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). Refusing to bring tribute was a public act of contempt, much like Nabal&#8217;s insult to David in <a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10&#8211;11</a>. Their scorn fulfilled Samuel&#8217;s warning that rejecting God&#8217;s king is ultimately rejecting God Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Scripture repeatedly links dishonor toward God-given authority with spiritual danger (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>). Their attitude parallels <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, where withholding honor from the Lord exposes a heart far from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Saul remained silent about it.</b><p>At this moment Saul demonstrates restraint and humility. Rather than retaliate, he waits on the Lord&#8212;mirroring <a href="/proverbs/19-11.htm">Proverbs 19:11</a>, &#8220;It is his glory to overlook an offense,&#8221; and anticipating Jesus, who &#8220;did not retaliate; instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). Saul&#8217;s silence keeps the focus on God&#8217;s coming vindication (<a href="/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>) and models <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>: &#8220;Leave room for God&#8217;s wrath.&#8221; Sadly, Saul would later abandon this humility (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>), yet here his silence is an early sign of wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a> reveals the immediate clash between divine appointment and human unbelief. Worthless men reject God&#8217;s chosen king, question his ability, and publicly show contempt, yet Saul answers with patient silence. The verse warns against despising God-ordained leadership, highlights the root of unbelief, and commends humble restraint that trusts the Lord to vindicate His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">The children of Belial.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">worthless men. </span>(See Note on <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm" title="Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.">1Samuel 2:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And they despised him.</span>--As above suggested, these malcontents were probably princes and leading men of the great tribes of Judah and Ephraim, displeased that the new king should be selected from the small unimportant tribe of Benjamin. It will be remembered that the tribe of Benjamin had been almost entirely destroyed in the civil war related in the concluding chapters of Judges. "They despised him," because in no way had he made his mark, either in the arts of war or peace. From what has gone before (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?
