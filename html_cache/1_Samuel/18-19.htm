Saul had previously promised his daughter to the man who defeated Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>). David, having achieved this, was entitled to marry Merab. This reflects the cultural practice of arranged marriages and the use of marriage as a political tool in ancient Israel. The giving of a daughter in marriage was a significant event, often involving negotiations and agreements between families.<p><b>she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah</b><br>Instead of fulfilling his promise to David, Saul gives Merab to Adriel. This act of giving Merab to another man highlights Saul's growing jealousy and fear of David, as well as his unreliability and deceit. Adriel of Meholah is mentioned here, and Meholah is a region in the Jordan Valley, indicating a connection to a specific geographical location. This marriage would later have tragic consequences, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8-9</a>, where the sons of Merab and Adriel are executed.

I will give her to you as your wife; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>).

It may have been brought about owing to some great fit of jealousy of David; or possibly the large gifts in money or valuables offered by the wealthy Adriel for the princess's hand may have occasioned this arbitrary act of Saul. Such gifts to the father in return for the daughter's hand were customary. In the case of such a prize as the Princess Merab, the gift would doubtless have been very costly. David, who was comparatively a poor man, was of course unable to show such liberality; besides, the young hero looked, no doubt, upon the marriage as the fulfilment of the old promise to the victor in the combat with the giant. The marriage, however, of the daughter of King Saul and Adriel was consummated, and was disastrous in its consequences. They had five sons, and they fell victims to the blood revenge exacted by the Gibeonites from the family of Saul: the five hapless youths were "hanged" (we read in <a href="/2_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.">2Samuel 21:9</a>) "in the hill before the Lord." These three verses (17-19) are entirely omitted by the LXX., apparently because they failed to see any reason for Saul's sudden change of purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Merab... was given unto Adriel.</span> A large dower was doubtless offered to Saul in return for his daughter, and, as he had never wished David to have her, he proved untrue to his word.
