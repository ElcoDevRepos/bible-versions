The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles for control over territories. This ongoing warfare highlights the instability and danger faced by Israel, as well as the need for strong leadership.<p><b>David went out and fought the Philistines</b><br>David's role as a military leader is emphasized here. Despite being a young man, David had already proven himself in battle, most notably against Goliath. His willingness to engage the Philistines demonstrates his courage and commitment to Israel's defense. This also foreshadows David's future as a king who would lead Israel to numerous military victories.<p><b>and struck them with such a mighty blow</b><br>David's success in battle is attributed to his skill and perhaps divine favor.

This victory can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and deliver Israel from its enemies, with David as His chosen instrument.<p><b>that they fled before him</b><br>The Philistines' retreat signifies a complete and overwhelming defeat.
