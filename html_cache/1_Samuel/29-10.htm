In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/29.htm">1 Samuel 29</a>, David is in a precarious situation among the Philistines, and the early morning departure suggests a strategic withdrawal to avoid conflict. Biblically, early morning is often a time for significant events or divine encounters, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> when Abraham rises early to obey God's command. The emphasis on morning also reflects a new beginning or a fresh start, aligning with <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>, which speaks of God's mercies being new every morning.<p><b>along with your master&#8217;s servants who came with you</b><br>This refers to the men who were loyal to David, highlighting the importance of leadership and loyalty. David's men were a diverse group, including those in distress, debt, or discontented (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>). Their presence underscores the theme of God using unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes. The mention of "master's servants" also reflects the hierarchical social structure of the time, where loyalty to one's leader was paramount.<p><b>and go as soon as it is light.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to leave at first light suggests a desire for discretion and safety. In ancient times, travel was safer during daylight due to the dangers of the night, including bandits and wild animals. This timing also reflects wisdom and prudence, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>, which compares the path of the righteous to the light of dawn. The departure at light symbolizes moving from darkness to light, a recurring biblical theme representing salvation and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the light of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who at this time is living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The Philistine king of Gath who has given David refuge and trusts him, despite the suspicions of the other Philistine leaders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_commanders.htm">Philistine Commanders</a></b><br>Military leaders who distrust David and fear he might turn against them in battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town given to David by Achish, where David and his men reside.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The impending battle between the Philistines and Israel, from which David is being sent away.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_unlikely_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty in Unlikely Circumstances</a></b><br>David's dismissal from the battle is a divine intervention that prevents him from fighting against his own people, Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>David's journey shows that God's plans unfold in His perfect timing, even when circumstances seem unfavorable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_and_reputation.htm">Integrity and Reputation</a></b><br>Despite living among the Philistines, David maintains his integrity, which ultimately preserves his reputation among the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God often protects His people in ways they may not immediately recognize, as seen in David's removal from a potentially compromising situation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_obedience.htm">Leadership and Obedience</a></b><br>David's obedience to leave as instructed by Achish demonstrates humility and respect for authority, even when it might not align with his personal desires.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_29_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 29:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_29_10_God_s_protection_of_David.htm">How does 1 Samuel 29:10 demonstrate God's protection over David's future kingship?

The instruction mirrors examples like Abraham rising early to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Moses confronting Pharaoh at daybreak (<a href="/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Rising early avoids delay and temptation; it also prevents David&#8217;s presence from escalating tensions in the Philistine camp.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself modeled early-morning action and prayer (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>), underscoring the value of seeking God&#8217;s purposes first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with your master&#8217;s servants who came with you</b><p>&#8226; David is reminded of his submission to Saul&#8217;s kingship&#8212;even while exiled&#8212;and of his responsibility for the men under him (<a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; 30:9).<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses corporate accountability: no one is to be left behind. Similar solidarity is seen in Gideon&#8217;s three hundred (<a href="/judges/7-17.htm">Judges 7:17</a>) and the loyal followers who stayed with David during Absalom&#8217;s revolt (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; In the body of Christ, leaders likewise safeguard every member (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>go as soon as it is light</b><p>&#8226; Dawn departure limits suspicion, offers protection, and underscores transparency&#8212;&#8220;whoever walks in the day does not stumble&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing recalls Lot&#8217;s early escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a>) and Peter&#8217;s swift release from prison (<a href="/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8-10</a>), both deliverances arranged by God.<p>&#8226; Light in Scripture portrays God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>) and His call to separation from darkness (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-11</a>). David&#8217;s dawn exit keeps him unstained by a battle against Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/29-10.htm">1 Samuel 29:10</a> records Achish&#8217;s firm yet gracious directive that David and his men leave at first light. Literally and historically, it ends David&#8217;s brief alignment with the Philistine army. Spiritually, it showcases God&#8217;s faithful oversight, sparing His anointed from compromising combat and steering him back toward Israel&#8217;s throne. The verse invites believers to heed God&#8217;s timely guidance, act promptly, and walk openly in the light He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">With thy master's servants.</span>--The words have perplexed expositors. It is hardly the expression we should expect Achish to use of David's followers. All Israelites were, of course, "subjects of Saul," but the term would hardly be used except by one hostile to David, as Nabal was; he once (<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>) made use of an insulting term of a like nature to David. Achish, we know, seemed ever kindly disposed to the outlawed son of Jesse. A probable suggestion has, however, been lately made, that the reference here is to those tribes of Manasseh (comp. <a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-19.htm" title="And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.">1Chronicles 12:19-21</a>) who had only lately come over to David. Was it not also possible that these very Manassites, who had only very recently deserted the king's cause for David's, were known to some of the Philistines as Saul's soldiers, and that their suspicions had been awakened in the first place by finding them marching under David's standard in the division of Gath?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With thy master's servants</span>. It has been well remarked that while this would be a strange description of David's own men, it would exactly describe that band of deserters belonging to the tribe of Manasseh who, instead of obeying Saul's summons to the war with the Philistines, joined David about this time (see <a href="/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As soon as ye be up early in the morning,</span> etc. If it was on the second day s march that the Philistine lords objected to David's continuance with them, he would be back at Gath in two days, and on the third day reach Ziklag, as is said in <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>. However difficult David's position may have been, still every one must condemn his conduct towards Achish as dishonourable; but God, who often deals with men more mercifully than they deserve, nevertheless rescued him from his state of perplexity, and saved him from the necessity of either fighting against his own countrymen or of still more dishonourably breaking his word to Achish by deserting in the battle. He also sent him home just in time to rescue from a miserable fate those whom he loved. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/29-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now then,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
