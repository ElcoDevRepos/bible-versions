During the time of the Judges and early monarchy, individuals seeking divine guidance would consult a "seer." The term "seer" (Hebrew: "ro'eh") indicates someone who could perceive or see visions from God, offering insight into His will. This practice reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where spiritual leaders played a crucial role in guiding the people. The seer was often sought for personal, communal, or national matters, indicating the importance of divine direction in all aspects of life. This practice is exemplified in the narrative of Saul seeking Samuel, the seer, for guidance about his lost donkeys, which ultimately leads to his anointing as king (<a href="/1_samuel/9-3.htm">1 Samuel 9:3-10</a>).<p><b>(For the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.)</b><br>This phrase highlights the evolution of terminology and roles within Israel's religious framework. The transition from "seer" to "prophet" (Hebrew: "nabi") suggests a shift in the understanding and function of these spiritual leaders. While "seer" emphasizes the visionary aspect, "prophet" encompasses a broader role, including preaching, teaching, and conveying God's messages to the people. Prophets like Samuel, who is both a seer and a prophet, serve as intermediaries between God and Israel, guiding them according to divine revelation. This change in terminology also reflects the development of Israel's religious identity and the increasing complexity of their relationship with God. Prophets are seen throughout the Old Testament, with figures like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, who not only foretell future events but also call the people to repentance and faithfulness to God's covenant. This role foreshadows the ultimate prophet, Jesus Christ, who perfectly reveals God's will and serves as the mediator of the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A significant prophet in Israel who anointed the first two kings, Saul and David.

The note highlights Israel&#8217;s habit of inquiring of the Lord, underscores God&#8217;s readiness to guide His people, and assures us that, though vocabulary changes, the reliability of God&#8217;s Word and His servants never does.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Beforetime in Israel.</span>--This verse was evidently inserted in the original book of memoirs of the days of Samuel by a later hand. Three special words are found in the Divine writings for the inspired messengers or interpreters of the Eternal wilt; of these, the title seer (<span class= "ital">roeh</span>) was the most ancient. It is the title, evidently, by which Samuel in his lifetime was generally known. "Is the seer here?" we read in this passage; and "Where is the seer's house?" and "I am the seer." As time passed on, the term, in the sense of an inspired man of God, became obsolete, and the word <span class= "ital">chozeh, </span>"a gazer." on strange visions, seemed to have been the word used for one inspired. The title <span class= "ital">nabi</span>--prophet--began to come into <span class= "ital">common </span>use in the time of Samuel, to whom the term is not unfrequently applied. The word <span class= "ital">nabi, </span>or prophet, is found in nearly all the Old Testament books, from Genesis to Malachi, though rarely in the earlier writings. This note was inserted by some scribe who lived comparatively later (perhaps in the time of Ezra), but who must have been a reviser of the sacred text of very high authority, as this "note" has come down to us as an integral part of the received Hebrew text. The reason of the insertion is obvious. The title <span class= "ital">roeh--</span>seer--as time passed on, no longer belonged exclusively to "a man of God." The scribe who put in this expression was desirous of pointing out that when Samuel lived it was <span class= "ital">the </span>word always used for a prophet of the Lord. In those early days it had not deteriorated in meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beforetime,</span> etc. This verse is evidently a gloss, written originally by some later hand in the margin, in order to explain the word used for seer in vers. 11, 18, 19. Inserted here in the text it interrupts the narrative, and is itself somewhat incomprehensible. The Septuagint offers a very probable reading, namely, "for the people in old time used to call the prophet a seer," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it was a word used chiefly by the common people. Prophet, <span class="accented">nabi</span>, is really the older and established word from the beginning of the Old Testament to the end. The word <span class="accented">roeh</span>, used in this place for seer, is comparatively rare, as a popular word would be in written compositions. It refers to that which is seen by the ordinary sight, to waking vision (see on 1 Samuel 3:1, 10), whereas the other word for seer, <span class="accented">chozeh</span>, refers to ecstatic vision. <span class="accented">Roeh</span> is used by Isaiah, ch. Isaiah 30:10, apparently in much the same sense as here, of those whom the people consulted in their difficulties, and they might be true prophets as Samuel was, or mere pretenders to occult powers. The present narrative makes it plain that <span class="accented">roeh</span> was used in a good sense in Samuel's days; but gradually it became degraded, and while <span class="accented">chozeh</span> became the respectful word for a prophet, <span class="accented">roeh</span> became the contrary. Another conclusion also follows. We have seen that there are various indications that the Books of Samuel in their present state are later than his days. Here, on the contrary, we have a narrative couched in the very language of his times; for the writer of the gloss contained in this verse was displeased at Samuel being called a <span class="accented">roeh</span>, but did not dare to alter it, though taking care to note that it was equivalent in those days to calling him a <span class="accented">nabi.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(Formerly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
