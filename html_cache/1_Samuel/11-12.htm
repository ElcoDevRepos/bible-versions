Samuel was a key figure in transitioning Israel from a theocracy to a monarchy. His role as a mediator between God and the people is crucial, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15-17</a>, where he judged Israel all the days of his life. The people's approach to Samuel shows their respect for his leadership and spiritual guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Who said that Saul should not reign over us?</b><br>This question reflects the people's support for Saul after his victory over the Ammonites, as described earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>. Initially, there was skepticism about Saul's ability to lead (<a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>), but his successful military campaign solidified his position as king. This moment highlights the shift in public opinion and the acceptance of Saul's kingship, fulfilling God's earlier directive through Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16-17</a>).<p><b>Bring those men here</b><br>The demand to bring the dissenters forward shows the people's desire for unity and the elimination of opposition to Saul's rule. This reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where loyalty to the king was paramount for national stability. The call for accountability is consistent with the biblical principle of dealing with rebellion, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>, which prescribes consequences for those who defy authority.<p><b>so we can kill them!&#8221;</b><br>The call for execution underscores the seriousness of rebellion against God's anointed king. In the ancient Near Eastern context, treason was often met with severe punishment to deter others from similar actions. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice and the protection of God's chosen leaders. However, Saul's response in the following verses, where he spares the dissenters, foreshadows the mercy and grace that are fully realized in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.

The nation is exhilarated, their confidence in God&#8217;s newly anointed king soaring.<p>- They turn instinctively to Samuel, the prophet-judge who has guided them for decades (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15-17</a>). Just as Israel once ran to Moses after a decisive deliverance (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>), here they address Samuel as the recognized spiritual authority.<p>- Their action highlights a healthy chain of command: God leads through His chosen servants. We see the same pattern when the elders consult Samuel about kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4-6</a>) and when the people later implore him to intercede after the thunderstorm at Gilgal (<a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18-19</a>).<p>- In short, the crowd&#8217;s words acknowledge that both military victory and political legitimacy must line up with prophetic oversight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who said that Saul should not reign over us?&#8221;</b><p>- The question recalls the scornful reaction some &#8220;worthless men&#8221; showed when Saul was first proclaimed king: &#8220;They despised him and brought him no tribute&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>).<p>- Now, after one clear demonstration of God&#8217;s power, the nation wants to expose those doubters. It is a classic reversal&#8212;like Joseph&#8217;s brothers bowing before the very man they once rejected (<a href="/genesis/37-19.htm">Genesis 37:19-20</a>; 42:6).<p>- The crowd&#8217;s indignation also echoes Jesus&#8217; parable, &#8220;We do not want this man to reign over us&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-14.htm">Luke 19:14</a>), illustrating the timeless human tendency to resist God-appointed leadership until undeniable proof forces a change of heart.<p>- By asking &#8220;Who said&#8230;?&#8221; they declare, in effect, that public opinion must submit to God&#8217;s choice. Their words affirm <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> that &#8220;there is no authority except from God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Bring those men here so we can kill them!&#8221;</b><p>- The people move from exposing critics to demanding capital punishment. Under the Mosaic law, rebellion against God&#8217;s ordained ruler could be deemed treason (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; 13:5).<p>- Their zeal parallels the Israelites&#8217; execution of false prophets on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>) and Asa&#8217;s reform oath, &#8220;Whoever would not seek the LORD&#8230;should be put to death&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-13.htm">2 Chronicles 15:13</a>).<p>- Yet Saul immediately answers, &#8220;No one will be put to death today, for this day the LORD has brought salvation to Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>). His restraint reflects <a href="/proverbs/19-11.htm">Proverbs 19:11</a>; &#8220;It is his glory to overlook an offense,&#8221; and foreshadows Christ&#8217;s mercy toward those who denied Him (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p>- The contrast teaches that while righteous indignation has its place, vengeance belongs to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). True leadership tempers justice with grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse captures a pivotal moment of national unity after Saul&#8217;s first victory. The people, addressing Samuel, rush to affirm the king God has clearly validated, exposing earlier dissenters and demanding swift punishment. Their zeal underscores the seriousness of rejecting divine authority, yet Saul&#8217;s subsequent mercy demonstrates that God-honoring leadership balances justice with compassion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And the people said unto Samuel.</span>--The great weight and influence of the seer among the people is strikingly shown by this record of their turning to him, even in the first flush of this great victory of Saul's. It was Samuel to whom the people looked to bring to punishment the men who had dared to question the wisdom of electing Saul as king. It should be remembered, too, that the royal summons to Israel which accompanied the bloody war-signal of King Saul, ran in the joint names of Saul and Samuel. (See <a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1Samuel 11:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people said unto Samuel.</span> Even after this glorious victory the people turn to Samuel, and doubtless his presence and influence had had great weight in gaining obedience to Saul's command (ver. 7). They now, with the old tumultuous violence, demand' that those who had opposed Saul's election should be put to death. Probably the ringleaders of Saul's opponents were some of the ciders disappointed at not being chosen themselves (see on 1 Samuel 10:27). But Saul displays, first, the kingly virtue of clemency, saying, <span class="cmt_word">There shall not a man be put to death this day</span> - a decision politic as well as generous, for bloodshed would have led only to future feuds; and, secondly, piety, in so humbly ascribing to Jehovah the salvation that had been wrought in Israel.
