Abiathar is the son of Ahimelech, the high priest, who was killed by Saul's orders. This interaction highlights David's leadership and his role as a protector of those wronged by Saul's tyranny. Abiathar's presence with David signifies the transfer of priestly support from Saul to David, foreshadowing David's eventual kingship and the establishment of Jerusalem as the religious center.<p><b>I knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day</b><br>Doeg the Edomite, a servant of Saul, was present at Nob when David visited Ahimelech. His presence is significant as it underscores the tension between David and Saul. Doeg's identity as an Edomite, a descendant of Esau, adds a layer of historical enmity between Israel and Edom. This moment reflects the broader theme of betrayal and the consequences of Saul's paranoia. David's awareness of Doeg's presence indicates his understanding of the potential threat, yet he still sought refuge and sustenance from Ahimelech, demonstrating his reliance on God's provision.<p><b>and that he was sure to tell Saul</b><br>Doeg's loyalty to Saul and his subsequent betrayal of Ahimelech's assistance to David resulted in the tragic slaughter of the priests at Nob. This phrase highlights the destructive power of gossip and betrayal, themes prevalent throughout the Bible. It also illustrates the consequences of Saul's disobedience and his descent into madness, as he increasingly views David as a threat. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of righteous leadership.<p><b>I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father&#8217;s house</b><br>David takes personal responsibility for the deaths of the priests, showing his integrity and sense of accountability. This admission reflects David's character as a man after God's own heart, willing to acknowledge his role in the tragedy. It also foreshadows the sacrificial nature of Christ, who takes responsibility for the sins of humanity. David's remorse and willingness to protect Abiathar demonstrate his commitment to justice and mercy, key attributes of his future reign as king. This moment solidifies the bond between David and Abiathar, who would later serve as high priest during David's kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul, who seeks his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abiathar.htm">Abiathar</a></b><br>The son of Ahimelech, the priest, who escaped the massacre of the priests at Nob and fled to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/doeg_the_edomite.htm">Doeg the Edomite</a></b><br>Saul's chief herdsman who informed Saul about David's visit to Ahimelech, leading to the slaughter of the priests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of paranoia and jealousy, seeking to kill David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>A city of priests where Ahimelech and other priests were killed by Saul's command.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin_and_deception.htm">The Consequences of Sin and Deception</a></b><br>David's initial deception at Nob had far-reaching consequences, reminding us of the ripple effects of our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/taking_responsibility.htm">Taking Responsibility</a></b><br>David's acknowledgment of his role in the tragedy at Nob teaches us the importance of owning our mistakes and seeking reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_following_god.htm">The Cost of Following God</a></b><br>Abiathar's loss and subsequent alliance with David illustrate the sacrifices often required in following God's anointed path.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Despite the injustice faced, David's life demonstrates a trust in God's ultimate justice and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_conscience.htm">The Role of Conscience</a></b><br>David's response to Abiathar shows a sensitive conscience, prompting us to maintain a heart attuned to God's moral standards.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_22_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 22:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_responsibility_in_1_Sam_22_22.htm">How does 1 Samuel 22:22 reveal David's sense of responsibility and leadership?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_David_s_admission_in_1_Sam_22_22.htm">What can we learn about consequences from David's admission in 1 Samuel 22:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/David_s_response_links_to_Psalm_51_s_repentance.htm">How does David's response in 1 Samuel 22:22 connect to Psalm 51's themes of repentance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_David_s_fault_to_spiritual_growth.htm">How can we apply David's acknowledgment of fault to our own spiritual growth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/David_s_reaction_on_Christian_accountability.htm">What does David's reaction teach us about accountability in our Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_blame_himself_for_deaths.htm">Why did David feel responsible for the deaths of the priests in 1 Samuel 22:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_22_22_Insights_on_David_s_leadership.htm">How does 1 Samuel 22:22 reflect on David's leadership and decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_22_22_Saul_s_jealousy_impact.htm">What does 1 Samuel 22:22 reveal about the consequences of Saul's jealousy?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_wasn't_david_punished_for_lying.htm">Why did God not condemn or punish David for lying to Ahimelech (1 Samuel 21:1&#8211;2)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_142_4_align_with_1_sam_22_2.htm">Psalm 142:4 shows David claiming no one cares for him--how does this reconcile with 1 Samuel 22:2, where he has loyal followers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_was_high_priest_when_david_ate_bread.htm">Who was high priest when David went into the House of GOD and ate the consecrated bread?

If the Rabbinical belief that the identity between the family servant, or steward, who accompanied the young man Saul on that journey when we first meet with him (see 1 Samuel 9) be accepted, this enmity would be partly accounted for. The Edomite Doeg, brought up with Saul in the family of Kish, no doubt was jealous for his master and his master's house with the passionate jealousy we so often find in old servants. He would share and probably fan his royal master's envy and fear respecting the brilliant young hero who was so rapidly supplanting Saul and Saul's house in the affections of Israel. So when David, flying for his life from Saul, met Doeg at the Sanctuary of Nob, he was seized with grave misgivings as to what would happen; and now, after the terrible vengeance of Saul, seems to reproach himself with having in Doeg's presence exposed the hapless priest Ahimelech to Saul's furious anger.<p>The Talmud says the servant (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm" title="Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.">1Samuel 16:18</a>) who first searched out and brought David to play to the sick king was Doeg, anxious to relieve his master's sufferings, but curiously adds that even then the praises bestowed on David by Doeg were unreal: <span class= "ital">"</span>All the praises of David enumerated by Doeg in <a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm" title="Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.">1Samuel 16:18</a> had a malicious object."--<span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 93, Colossians 2.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1436;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
