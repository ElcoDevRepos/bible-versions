The phrase indicates a specific moment in the narrative, suggesting a transition or significant event about to unfold. It is a time when God is preparing to speak to Samuel, marking a shift from the old priesthood under Eli to a new prophetic leadership.<p><b>Eli, whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see</b><br>Eli's physical blindness symbolizes the spiritual blindness and decline of Israel's priesthood. His inability to see reflects the lack of spiritual vision and discernment among the leaders of Israel at the time. This condition also foreshadows the judgment that will come upon Eli's house due to the sins of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas. The dimming of Eli's eyesight can be seen as a metaphor for the fading influence and effectiveness of his priestly role.<p><b>was lying in his room</b><br>Eli's position in his room suggests a state of inactivity and passivity, contrasting with the active role Samuel is about to take. It highlights Eli's detachment from the spiritual needs of Israel and his failure to address the corruption within the priesthood. This setting also prepares the reader for the divine encounter that Samuel will experience, emphasizing the transition from Eli's leadership to Samuel's prophetic ministry. The mention of Eli lying down may also allude to his advanced age and frailty, underscoring the need for new leadership in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, Eli was responsible for the spiritual leadership of the nation.

That backdrop matters:<p>&#8226; Israel was living with minimal prophetic direction, recalling the chaotic climate of <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s silence highlights the significance of what He is about to do through young Samuel.<p>&#8226; The phrase anchors the story in real history&#8212;this is not myth but an exact moment when God chose to break the silence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eli</b><p>Eli is the elderly high priest and judge (<a href="/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; He has served faithfully for years, yet he has tolerated the sin of his sons (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12, 22</a>&#8211;25).<p>&#8226; His mixed legacy parallels leaders like Gideon, who finished less brightly than they began (<a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already warned him through a prophet (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27&#8211;36</a>), so every detail of his life here foreshadows coming judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see</b><p>The statement is literal&#8212;Eli&#8217;s physical eyes are failing with age, much like Isaac&#8217;s before he blessed Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links physical blindness with diminished discernment; Jesus later rebukes the Pharisees as &#8220;blind guides&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the narrative never denies the literal fact: Eli simply cannot see. This tangible weakness mirrors his declining spiritual perception of Israel&#8217;s condition (<a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>).<p>&#8226; By contrast, &#8220;Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>), underscoring how obedience can preserve both vision and insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was lying in his room</b><p>&#8226; It is nighttime in the tabernacle area; Samuel sleeps near the ark &#8220;before the lamp of God had gone out&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s position shows routine&#8212;he is off-duty and unaware&#8212;just as Samson slept before losing strength (<a href="/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God often chooses quiet, ordinary settings to speak, whether to Samuel here or to Joseph in a dream (<a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s lying down contrasts with the LORD&#8217;s active word that will soon stand Samuel on his feet (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase in <a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a> is precise and purposeful. In a time when revelation was scarce, an aging priest with fading sight rests in darkness, embodying Israel&#8217;s spiritual drift. God will pierce that darkness by calling Samuel, proving once again that His word is living, literal, and unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eli... could not see.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> clearly. His sight was fast failing him, and Samuel, still called a <span class="cmt_word">child</span>, <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, but probably, as Josephus states ('Antiq.,' 5:10, 4), now fully twelve years old, was in constant attendance upon him because of his increasing infirmities. Both were sleeping in the temple; for literally the words are, <span class="accented">And Samuel was sleeeping in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was.</span> Of course neither Eli nor Samuel were in the holy place; but, as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>, the word <span class="accented">temple</span> is used in its proper sense of the whole palace of Israel's spiritual King, in which were chambers provided for the use of the high priest and those in attendance upon him. In ver. 3 the <span class="cmt_word">lamp</span> is mentioned as fixing the exact time. Though it is said that the seven-branched candelabrum was "to burn always" (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>), yet this apparently was to be by perpetually relighting it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 30:7, 8); and as Aaron was commanded to dress and light it every morning and evening, and supply it with oil, the night would be far advanced and morning near before it <span class="cmt_word">went out.</span> In the stillness then of the late night Samuel, sunk in heavy sleep, hears a voice calling him, and springing up, naturally hurries to Eli, supposing that he needed his services. Eli had not heard the voice, and concluding that it was a mistake, bids Samuel return to his bed. Again the voice rings upon his ear, and again he hastens to Eli, only to be told to lie down again. In ver. 7 the reason is given why Samuel was thus thrice mistaken. <span class="cmt_word">Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.</span> Doubtless he knew Jehovah in the way in which the sons of Eli did not know him (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his conscience and spiritual life, but he did not know him as one who reveals his will unto men. Prophecy had long been a <span class="accented">rare</span> thing, and though Samuel had often heard God's voice in the recesses of his heart, speaking to him of right and wrong, he knew nothing of God as a living Person, giving commands for men to obey, and bestowing knowledge to guide them in doing his will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
