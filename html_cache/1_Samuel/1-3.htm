It reflects the Jewish tradition of attending the annual feasts, such as Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>. This regularity underscores the importance of perseverance in faith and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>Elkanah would go up from his city</b><br>Elkanah, a Levite, lived in Ramathaim-Zophim, in the hill country of Ephraim. His journey "up" to Shiloh reflects the geographical elevation of Shiloh, which was a central place of worship before the establishment of Jerusalem as the religious center. This pilgrimage signifies a commitment to worship despite the distance, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing spiritual duties.<p><b>to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over the heavenly armies, reflecting His majesty and authority. Worship and sacrifice were central to Israelite religion, serving as acts of devotion and atonement. This practice connects to the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>at Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was the religious center of Israel before the temple was built in Jerusalem. It housed the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant, making it a significant location for worship. Archaeological evidence supports Shiloh's role as a religious center during this period. The presence of the Ark signifies God's dwelling among His people, a precursor to the incarnation of Christ, Emmanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>where Eli&#8217;s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD</b><br>Hophni and Phinehas, sons of Eli, served as priests but were corrupt, as detailed in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>. Their behavior contrasts with the holiness required of priests, highlighting the need for righteous leadership. This situation sets the stage for God's judgment and the eventual rise of Samuel, a faithful servant.

The verse invites believers to practice persistent faith, lead their households to God&#8217;s appointed place, and trust the LORD to deal with corruption while honoring personal obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Went up out of his city yearly.</span>--The He brew expression rendered yearly, is found in <a href="/exodus/13-10.htm" title="You shall therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.">Exodus 13:10</a>, and there refers to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Passover. There is little doubt but that this great national festival is here referred to. It was the Passover that the whole family were accustomed to keep at the sanctuary of the Eternal. The writer places in strong contrast the piety and devotion which evidently still existed in the family life of many in Israel with the fearful disorders and crime which disfigured the priestly life in those days. There were not a few, doubtless, in Israel who, like Elkanah and his house, honoured the name of the Lord, while the recognised rulers and religious guides of the people, like the sons of Eli the high priest, too often lived in open and notorious sin.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the Lord of hosts.</span>--This is the first time in the Old Testament Book that we find the well-known appellation of the Eternal "Jehovah Sabaoth," Lord of hosts.<p>It is computed that this title of God occurs 260 times in the Old Testament, but it is not found in any of the books written or compiled before this time. In the New Testament it is only once used (see <a href="/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">James 5:4</a>).<p>The glorious title, with which Isaiah, who uses it some sixty times, and Jeremiah some eighty times, have especially made us familiar, represented Jehovah, the Eternal One, as ruler over the heavenly hosts: that is, over the angels and the stars; the stars being conceived to be the dwelling-places of these deathless beings.<p>The idea of their invisible God-Friend being the sovereign Master of a host of those innumerable glorious beings usually known as angels, or messengers, was no strange one to Hebrew thought. For instance, already in the story of Jacob we find the patriarch calling the angels who appeared to him the "camp of God"(<a href="/context/genesis/32-1.htm" title="And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.">Genesis 32:1-2</a>).<p>In the blessing of Moses in the magnificent description of the giving of the law on Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), we read of "ten thousands of saints" (Kodesh). The glorious Angel who allowed Joshua to worship him under the towers of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm" title="And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What said my Lord to his servant?">Joshua 5:14</a>) speaks of himself as "captain or prince of the host of the Lord." It is especially noteworthy that here in these Books of Samuel, which tell of the establishment of an earthly sovereignty over the tribes, this stately title of the real King in Israel, which afterwards became so general, first appears. It was the solemn protest of Samuel and his school against any eclipsing of the mighty but invisible sovereignty of the Eternal by the passing splendours and the outward pomp of an earthly monarchy set up over the people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This man went up out of his city yearly.</span> Once in the year Elkanah went up to offer sacrifice before the ark. The original command had required this thrice a year of all Israelites; but though a Levite and a religious man, Elkanah went up but once; and such apparently was the rule in our Lord's time (<a href="/luke/2-41.htm">Luke 2:41</a>), the season preferred being naturally the passover, while the other feasts gave opportunities for the performance of this duty to those unable to leave their homes at so early a period of the year. The ark was now at Shiloh, a town in Ephraim, about ten miles south of Shechem; for Joshua had removed it from Gilgal (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), not merely because Shiloh occupied a more central position, but as marking the primary rank of his own tribe (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>). Its destruction by the Philistines after the capture of the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1</a>) was so complete, and attended apparently by such barbarous cruelties (<a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-64</a>), that it never recovered its importance, and Jeroboam passed it by when seeking for places where to set up his calves. <span class="cmt_word">To sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts.</span> This title of the Deity, "LORD (in capitals, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah) of Hosts," is a remarkable one. Fully it would be "Jehovah God of Hosts," and the omission of the word God shows that the phrase was one of long standing shortened down by constant use. And yet, though found 260 times in the Bible, this is the first place where it occurs. "Lord of Hosts" (Lord not in capitals, and meaning <span class="accented">master ruler</span>) occurs only once, in <a href="/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>. "God of Hosts," Elohim-Sabaoth, though rare, occurs four times in <a href="/psalms/80-4.htm">Psalm 80:4, 7, 14, 19</a>. The word Sabaoth, hosts, does not mean <span class="accented">armies</span>, inasmuch as it refers to numbers, and not to order and arrangement.. It is usually employed of the heavenly bodies (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>), which seem countless in multitude as they are spread over the vast expanse of an Oriental sky (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>); and as their worship was one of the oldest and most natural forms of idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26-28</a>), so this title is a protest against it, and claims for the one God dominion over the world of stars as well as in this lower sphere. Its origin then is to be sought at some time when there was a struggle between the worship of the sun and stars and the pure monotheism of the Hebrews. Occasionally the angels are called "the host of heaven" (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>), whenever the allusion is to their number, but when the idea is that of orderly arrangement they are called God's armies (<a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The two sons of Eli... were there.</span> The right translation of the Hebrew is, "And there (at Shiloh) the two sons of Eli... were priests." Eli apparently had devolved upon his sons his priestly functions, while he discharged the duties only of a judge. His position is remarkable. In the Book of Judges we find a state of anarchy. The people are rude, untutored, doing much as they pleased, committing often atrocious crimes, yet withal full of generous impulses, brave, and even heroic. There is little regular government among them, but whenever a great man stands forth, the people in his district submit themselves to him. The last judge, Samson, a man of pungent wit and vast personal prowess, seems to have been entirely destitute of all those qualities which make a man fit to be a ruler, but he kept the patriotism of the people alive and nerved them to resistance by the fame of his exploits. In Eli we find a ruler possessed of statesmanlike qualities. The country under him is prosperous; the Philistines, no longer dominant as in Samson's time, have so felt his power that when they gain a victory the Israelites are astonished at it (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Moreover, he is not only judge, he is also high priest; but instead of belonging to the family of Phinehas, the dominant house in the time of the Judges, he belongs to that of Ithamar. When, to solve the problem, we turn to the genealogies in the Chronicles, we find Eli's house omitted, though, even after the massacres at Shiloh and Nob, his grandson Ahimelech was still powerful (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), and one of his descendants returned from Babylon as jointly high priest with a descendant of Phinehas (<a href="/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2</a>). How long a space of time elapsed between the rude heroism of Samson's days and Eli's orderly government in Church and State we do not know, but the difference in the condition of things is vast. Igor do we know the steps by which Eli rose to power, but he must have been a man of no common ability. Warrior as well as statesman, he had delivered the people from the danger of becoming enslaved to the Philistines. In his own family alone he failed. His sons, allowed to riot in licentiousness, ruined the stately edifice of the father's fortunes, and the Philistines, taking advantage of the general discontent caused by their vices, succeeded in once again putting the yoke on Israel's neck. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Year after year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
