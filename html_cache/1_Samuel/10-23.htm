Saul had been chosen by God through the prophet Samuel to be the first king of Israel. The act of running suggests the people's eagerness to see their new leader. This moment is significant as it marks the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy in Israel. Saul's selection was divinely orchestrated, as seen earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9</a>, where God reveals to Samuel that Saul is His chosen one. The people's action of bringing Saul also reflects the communal aspect of leadership in ancient Israel, where the king was seen as a representative of the people before God.<p><b>and when he stood among the people</b><br>Saul standing among the people symbolizes his role as a leader who is both part of the community and set apart for a special purpose. This imagery is reminiscent of Moses and Joshua, who also stood among the people as leaders chosen by God. Saul's presence among the people highlights the unity and collective identity of Israel under a divinely appointed king. It also foreshadows the challenges Saul will face in balancing his role as a leader with his personal shortcomings.<p><b>he was a head taller than any of the others</b><br>Saul's physical stature is emphasized here, indicating his suitability for kingship in the eyes of the people. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, physical appearance was often associated with leadership qualities. Saul's height made him an imposing figure, which was culturally significant as kings were expected to lead in battle and command respect. This detail also sets the stage for later contrasts with David, who, despite being smaller in stature, is chosen by God for his heart rather than his appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Saul's height can be seen as a type of Christ, who stands above all in spiritual authority, though Christ's kingdom is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

When Abraham served his guests he &#8220;ran to the herd&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7</a>); Philip &#8220;ran up&#8221; to the chariot to share the gospel (<a href="/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30</a>).<p>- Here the same eagerness shows faith at work: once God speaks, delay is not an option (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought Saul</b><p>- Saul had been &#8220;hidden among the supplies&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>), reluctant to step forward. Yet the people physically bring him out, underscoring that God&#8217;s call overrides human hesitation (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p>- The scene parallels Solomon&#8217;s public enthronement when Nathan, Zadok, and Benaiah &#8220;brought&#8221; him to Gihon for anointing (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38-40</a>). Divine choice is confirmed by communal action.<p>- What God appoints, He also arranges in practical detail; the crowd becomes an instrument of His plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he stood among the people</b><p>- Saul is now in full view, no longer secluded. Leadership in Israel is meant to function among, not above, the covenant community (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>).<p>- Samuel later echoes this principle: &#8220;Here I am; bear witness against me before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>). Transparency fosters trust.<p>- Standing &#8220;among&#8221; the people anticipates the king&#8217;s duty to be both representative and servant (<a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was a head taller than any of the others</b><p>- Scripture records, &#8220;From his shoulders up he was taller than any of the people&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>). The public now sees what Samuel had already observed: impressive stature, humanly ideal for a warrior-king (<a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>).<p>- God granted Saul this physical advantage, yet later reminds Samuel, &#8220;The LORD does not see as man does&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Outer stature cannot replace inner obedience (<a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>).<p>- The detail is literal and historical, emphasizing both Saul&#8217;s suitability in the nation&#8217;s eyes and the contrast that will arise with David, a smaller shepherd whose heart pleases God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a> captures the dramatic unveiling of Israel&#8217;s first king. Urgent obedience (&#8220;they ran&#8221;), divine appointment (&#8220;brought Saul&#8221;), public accountability (&#8220;stood among the people&#8221;), and striking appearance (&#8220;a head taller&#8221;) combine to affirm God&#8217;s sovereign choice while hinting that outward greatness alone cannot sustain true leadership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he stood.</span> This rendering spoils the poetic force of the original, where the rapidity of their action is expressed by three preterites following hard upon one another.
