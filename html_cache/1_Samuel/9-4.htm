Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim. This area was often associated with leadership and strength, as seen in <a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>, where Deborah judged Israel under a palm tree in Ephraim. Saul's journey through this region signifies his connection to Israel's tribal heritage and foreshadows his future role as king.<p><b>and then through the land of Shalishah,</b><br>The land of Shalishah is mentioned only here in the Bible, and its exact location is uncertain. It is thought to be near the hill country of Ephraim, possibly indicating a region known for its agricultural productivity. The name "Shalishah" may suggest a division or a third part, hinting at a tripartite division of land or resources. This journey through Shalishah highlights the thoroughness of Saul's search and his dedication to his father's command.<p><b>but they did not find the donkeys.</b><br>The lost donkeys serve as a catalyst for Saul's journey, leading him to Samuel and his eventual anointing as king. In biblical times, donkeys were valuable assets, used for transportation and agriculture. The search for the donkeys symbolizes the beginning of Saul's path to leadership, as God uses ordinary circumstances to fulfill His divine purposes.<p><b>He and the servant went through the region of Shaalim,</b><br>Shaalim is another location with uncertain geography, possibly near the land of Shalishah. The mention of Saul's servant accompanying him emphasizes the social structure of the time, where servants played crucial roles in assisting their masters. This partnership reflects the importance of loyalty and service, themes that resonate throughout Saul's story and the broader biblical narrative.<p><b>but they were not there.</b><br>The repeated failure to find the donkeys underscores the futility of human efforts without divine intervention. This phrase highlights the theme of God's sovereignty, as He orchestrates events beyond human understanding. It also sets the stage for Saul's encounter with Samuel, where God's plan for Israel's monarchy begins to unfold.<p><b>Then they went through the land of Benjamin,</b><br>The land of Benjamin was Saul's own tribal territory, located north of Jerusalem. As a Benjamite, Saul's identity is rooted in this region, which was known for its warriors and strategic location. The tribe of Benjamin had a tumultuous history, including near destruction in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20-21</a>. Saul's journey through his homeland signifies a return to his roots and foreshadows his role as the first king from this tribe.<p><b>and still they did not find them.</b><br>The persistent inability to locate the donkeys emphasizes the theme of divine providence. Despite human efforts, it is ultimately God's plan that prevails. This phrase also highlights the limitations of human understanding and the need for reliance on God's guidance. Saul's fruitless search leads him to Samuel, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who would later become the first king of Israel.
