In the context of ancient Israel, hospitality and protection were highly valued, especially in the wilderness where dangers were prevalent. David's men acted honorably, reflecting the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). This behavior contrasts with Nabal's later refusal to reciprocate kindness, highlighting the biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>When we were in the field,</b><br>The field represents the open and often dangerous areas where shepherds tended their flocks. In biblical times, fields were vulnerable to raids by bandits or wild animals. The presence of David's men provided a sense of security, akin to the protection God offers His people (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). This setting underscores the shepherd motif prevalent in Scripture, where leaders are often depicted as shepherds caring for their flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>we were not harassed,</b><br>The absence of harassment indicates the effective protection provided by David's men. This protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and shepherd of His people (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>). The peace experienced by the shepherds under David's care mirrors the peace believers find in Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><b>and nothing of ours went missing</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the integrity and diligence of David's men. In a time when theft was common, their honesty is noteworthy. It reflects the biblical call to righteousness and integrity (<a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>). This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of stewardship and faithfulness in small things (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><b>the whole time we lived among them.</b><br>The duration of protection highlights the consistent and faithful nature of David's men. This consistency is a reflection of God's unchanging nature and faithfulness (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). Living among them suggests a close relationship, akin to the fellowship believers have with Christ (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>).

His testimony in <a href="/context/1_samuel/25-15.htm" title="But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:">1Samuel 25:15-16</a>, respecting David is clear and decisive, and occurring as it does in the heart of an episode most discreditable to David, it bears weighty testimony to the admirable discipline and the kind forethought of the son of Jesse in times when lawlessness and pillage would have been, if not excusable, certainly to be expected. The great powers of the future king were admirably displayed in this difficult period of his life. Few men could have so moulded a wild company of free lances into a force which, according to the rather unwilling testimony of these shepherds of Nabal's, was positively a blessing to the country, instead of being, as these bands of free lances usually have been, a terrible curse.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet these men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
