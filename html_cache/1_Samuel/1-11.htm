Vows were binding and taken seriously, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, where it is stated that a person must not break their word. Hannah's vow indicates her deep desperation and faith.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD of Hosts,</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God as the commander of the heavenly armies, emphasizing His power and sovereignty. This title is used frequently in the Old Testament, especially in contexts of divine intervention and protection, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>.<p><b>if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant</b><br>Hannah's plea for God to "look upon" her affliction echoes the language of the oppressed seeking divine intervention, similar to the Israelites' cries in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The term "maidservant" reflects humility and submission, acknowledging her position before God.<p><b>and remember me,</b><br>The request for God to "remember" is a call for divine action, not merely recollection. In biblical terms, when God remembers, He acts on behalf of His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a> with Noah and the ark.<p><b>not forgetting Your maidservant</b><br>This repetition underscores Hannah's earnestness and the cultural importance of remembrance. Forgetting, in this context, would imply neglect or abandonment, which Hannah seeks to avoid.<p><b>but giving her a son,</b><br>In ancient Israel, having children, especially sons, was crucial for family lineage and inheritance. Hannah's request for a son highlights her personal anguish and societal pressure, as barrenness was often seen as a curse or divine disfavor.<p><b>then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life,</b><br>Hannah's vow to dedicate her son reflects the practice of consecration, similar to the Nazirite vow described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. This dedication signifies a lifelong commitment to God's service, paralleling the dedication of Samson and John the Baptist.<p><b>and no razor shall ever touch his head.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a Nazirite vow, which involved abstaining from cutting one's hair, consuming wine, and avoiding contact with the dead. The uncut hair symbolizes a visible sign of consecration and separation unto God, as seen in the life of Samson (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who is deeply distressed by her barrenness.

The verse showcases persistent prayer, trust in God&#8217;s sovereignty, and wholehearted commitment to fulfill promises made to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And she vowed a vow.</span>--The vow of Hannah contained two solemn promises--the one pledged the son she prayed for to the service of the Eternal all the days of his life. The mother looked on to a life-long service in the ritual of the Tabernacle for him, but the Being who heard her prayer destined her son for higher work; in his case the priestly duties were soon merged in the far more responsible ones of the prophet--the great reformer of the people. The second promise undertook that he should be a Nazarite. Now the Nazariteship included three things--the refraining from intoxicating drinks, the letting the hair grow, and the avoiding all ceremonial defilement by corpses even of the nearest kin. Samuel was what the Talmud calls a perpetual Nazarite.<p>These strange restrictions and customs had an inner signification. The abstinence from wine and strong drink typified that the Nazarite determined to avoid all sensual indulgence which might cloud the mind and render the man unfit for prayer to, and work for, the Lord; the avoiding contact with the dead was a perpetual outward protest that the vower of the solemn vow renounced all moral defilement, that he gave up every thing which could stain and soil the life consecrated to the Eternal's service; the untouched hair, which here is especially mentioned, was a public protest that the consecrated one had determined to refrain from intercourse with the world, and to devote the whole strength and fulness of life to the Lord's work. The LXX. (Greek) Version here inserts the words, "and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink," wishing to bring the passage into stricter accordance with Numbers 6. The original Hebrew text, however, contents itself with specifying merely the outward sign of the untouched hair, by which these solemnly consecrated ones were publicly known.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And she made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tid&#183;d&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
