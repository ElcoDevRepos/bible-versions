The Philistines were a formidable enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. David's success is a testament to his faith in God, as he relied not on conventional weapons or armor but on divine assistance. This victory foreshadows the ultimate triumph of good over evil, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>with a sling and a stone</b><br>The sling was a simple weapon, often used by shepherds to protect their flocks. It required skill and precision, which David had honed during his time as a shepherd. The choice of a sling and stone highlights the theme of God using the humble and lowly to achieve His purposes, as seen in other biblical narratives like Gideon's victory over the Midianites. This also prefigures the way Jesus, the Good Shepherd, would use seemingly weak means to accomplish salvation.<p><b>without a sword in his hand</b><br>David's lack of a sword emphasizes his reliance on God rather than human weaponry. This detail underscores the biblical principle that victory comes not by might nor by power, but by God's Spirit. It contrasts with Goliath's reliance on physical strength and weaponry, illustrating the futility of trusting in human power alone. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to put on the full armor of God, which is spiritual rather than physical.<p><b>he struck down the Philistine and killed him</b><br>David's action in striking down Goliath is a decisive moment that demonstrates God's deliverance. It signifies the defeat of the enemies of God's people and the establishment of David as a leader chosen by God. This act of deliverance is a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, where Jesus, through His death and resurrection, defeats the ultimate enemy. David's victory is a precursor to the greater salvation that would come through Christ, the Son of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, anointed by God to be the future king of Israel.

The verse invites believers today to trust the same God who turns humble tools into instruments of deliverance and ensures that no enemy can stand against His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(50) <span class= "bld">But there was no sword in the hand of David.</span>--The story of the daring of the son of Jesse dwells, and with good reason, on the extraordinary valour and skill of the young champion of Israel. Had his heart for one instant failed him--as, indeed, it well might; had he not possessed a confidence which nothing could shake in an unseen Helper--or had his skill as a marksman failed him in the slightest degree, the Philistine with one blow would have laid David lifeless at his feet; or had the active shepherd boy eluded his giant antagonist, it must have been by flight. In any case, the single combat upon which Israel had staked so much would have gone against the chosen people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50, 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone.</span> It is evident that the narrator regarded David's victory as extraordinary; and no doubt it required not only great courage, but also perfect skill, as only the lower portion of the forehead would be exposed, and on no other part of the giant's body would a blow have been of any avail. The narrator also calls attention to the fact that David relied upon his sling alone, for <span class="cmt_word">there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> Slings probably were regarded as useful only to harass an enemy, while swords, which they had only lately been able to procure (<a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>), were regarded as the real weapons of offence. David, therefore, completes his victory by killing Goliath with his own sword as he lay stunned upon the ground.
