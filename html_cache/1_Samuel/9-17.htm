Samuel, a significant figure in Israel's history, was a prophet, judge, and leader. Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin, was searching for his father's lost donkeys, which providentially led him to Samuel. This encounter was orchestrated by God, highlighting His sovereignty in guiding events. The meeting took place in the region of Zuph, near Ramah, Samuel's hometown, emphasizing the divine orchestration in Saul's journey.<p><b>the LORD told him</b><br>The direct communication between God and Samuel underscores the prophetic office's importance in Israel. Samuel's role as a prophet was to convey God's will to the people, and here, God provides specific guidance. This divine revelation is consistent with how God communicated with His prophets throughout the Old Testament, ensuring His purposes were fulfilled. It also highlights the intimate relationship between God and His chosen servants, as seen in other prophetic callings, such as those of Moses and Elijah.<p><b>&#8220;Here is the man of whom I spoke;</b><br>God had previously informed Samuel about the coming of a man who would be anointed as king (<a href="/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-16</a>). This phrase confirms God's earlier revelation and demonstrates His foreknowledge and plan for Israel's leadership. The choice of Saul, a man of impressive stature and appearance, aligns with the people's desire for a king like the nations around them, though it contrasts with God's ideal of a leader after His own heart, as later seen in David.<p><b>he shall rule over My people.&#8221;</b><br>This statement establishes Saul's divine appointment as king, despite the people's initial request for a monarchy being seen as a rejection of God's direct rule (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). The term "rule" indicates a leadership role that involves governance, protection, and guidance. Saul's kingship is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingship through Jesus Christ, the true King who rules with justice and righteousness, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was instrumental in transitioning Israel from a confederation of tribes to a monarchy.
