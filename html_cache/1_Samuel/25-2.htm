It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a> as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. The region was known for its rugged terrain and was suitable for pastoral activities. The mention of Maon sets the geographical context for the narrative, indicating a location that was somewhat remote and conducive to the pastoral lifestyle.<p><b>whose business was in Carmel</b><br>Carmel, in this context, refers to a town in Judah, not to be confused with Mount Carmel in the north. This area was known for its fertile land, making it ideal for agriculture and livestock. The mention of business suggests that the man was engaged in significant economic activities, likely involving trade and livestock management, which were common in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>He was a very wealthy man</b><br>Wealth in ancient Israel was often measured by the possession of livestock, land, and servants. The description of the man as very wealthy indicates his high social status and influence within the community. Wealth was seen as a sign of God's blessing, though it also brought responsibilities, such as caring for the poor and acting justly.<p><b>with a thousand goats and three thousand sheep</b><br>The specific numbers highlight the extent of his wealth. Goats and sheep were valuable assets, providing milk, meat, wool, and hides. The large number of animals suggests that he was a major figure in the local economy. This wealth would have required a significant number of servants and shepherds to manage the herds, indicating a well-organized operation.<p><b>which he was shearing in Carmel</b><br>Shearing was a significant event in the agricultural calendar, often associated with feasting and celebration. It was a time of economic gain, as the wool was a valuable commodity. The act of shearing in Carmel suggests that the man utilized the fertile lands for his operations, and it sets the stage for the events that follow in the narrative, where David's men seek provisions during this time of abundance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/maon.htm">Maon</a></b><br>A town in the hill country of Judah, known for its pastoral lands.

The tradition even has preserved to us the exact number of his flocks, probably to enhance the churlishness of his reply to David when he asked him for some return for the protection his armed bands had afforded to these vast flocks in their pasturage on the edge of the desert. The occasion of David's mission to Nabal was the annual sheep-shearing of the rich sheep-master--always a great occasion, and accompanied usually on large estates by festivities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man in Maon.</span> Though strictly by descent belonging to Maon (for which see on 1 Samuel 23:24), his <span class="cmt_word">possessions</span> - rather, "his business," "occupation" (see <a href="/genesis/47-3.htm">Genesis 47:3</a>, and <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>, where it is translated <span class="accented">work</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">were in Carmel,</span> the small town just north of Maon, where Saul set up a trophy at the end of the Amalekite war (<a href="/1_samuel/15-12.htm">1 Samuel 15:12</a>), and to which Abigail belonged (<a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>).
