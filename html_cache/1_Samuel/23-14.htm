The wilderness provided natural fortifications and concealment from Saul's forces. This period of David's life is marked by his reliance on God for protection and guidance, as he was anointed but not yet king. The wilderness experience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who encountered God in desolate places, such as Moses and Elijah.<p><b>and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph.</b><br>The Wilderness of Ziph is located in the Judean desert, south of Hebron. This area is characterized by its rugged terrain and sparse vegetation, making it an ideal location for hiding. The Ziphites, inhabitants of the region, later betray David to Saul, highlighting the constant danger and betrayal David faced. The geographical setting underscores the theme of divine protection amidst human treachery.<p><b>Day after day Saul searched for him,</b><br>Saul's relentless pursuit of David illustrates his growing paranoia and desperation to maintain his kingship. This pursuit is a physical manifestation of Saul's spiritual decline and disobedience to God. The narrative contrasts Saul's human efforts with God's sovereign plan, emphasizing that no amount of human striving can thwart God's purposes.<p><b>but God would not deliver David into his hand.</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine protection over David's life. Despite Saul's persistent efforts, God's providence ensures David's safety. This protection is a fulfillment of God's promise to David and a testament to His faithfulness. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and kingship of David, a type of Christ, who would also be pursued but not overcome by His enemies. This divine intervention highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His anointed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is on the run from King Saul.

He does not stumble into the wilderness; he &#8220;stayed,&#8221; settling into natural fortresses&#8212;caves, cliffs, and ravines that offered real protection (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1&#8211;5</a>, where David previously used the cave of Adullam).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays God using such places to shield His servants&#8212;Elijah at the Kerith Ravine (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>) and John the Baptist in the Judean wilderness (<a href="/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a>).<p>&#8226; Physically, the strongholds remind us that God often provides practical means of safety while accomplishing His larger purposes (<a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph</b><p>&#8226; The landscape is now narrowed: &#8220;hill country&#8221; within the broader &#8220;Wilderness of Ziph.&#8221; This area south-southeast of Hebron is rugged, sparsely populated, and dotted with dense brush&#8212;ideal for hiding (<a href="/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a> speaks of Ziph as a Judahite town).<p>&#8226; David is not in exile because of wrongdoing; he is there because God is positioning him. <a href="/bsb/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>&#8217;s superscription expressly links that psalm with the &#8220;Ziphites,&#8221; capturing David&#8217;s heart cry from this very terrain: &#8220;Save me, O God, by Your name&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The geographic precision underlines the historical reliability of the account. What we read is anchored in real space and time (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Day after day Saul searched for him</b><p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s relentless pursuit reflects a hardened heart that resists God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). Though Samuel has told Saul the kingdom is torn from him, he spends his resources chasing the man after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;day after day&#8221; breathes the pressure David faced. He lives with continuous threat, echoing his later words: &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even Saul&#8217;s dogged efforts cannot override divine purpose. God allows the pursuit but limits its success, displaying His absolute sovereignty (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But God would not deliver David into his hand</b><p>&#8226; Here the contrast sharpens: man&#8217;s striving versus God&#8217;s preserving. The Hebrew narrative often pivots on this &#8220;but God&#8221; theme (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Protection is personal: &#8220;God would not deliver.&#8221; It is not luck, terrain, or David&#8217;s skill ultimately keeping him safe. The Lord Himself is the shield (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This line affirms God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. David has been anointed king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); therefore, until that promise is fulfilled, his life is tethered to God&#8217;s unbreakable word (<a href="/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also reassures later readers: the same God who guarded David guards all who trust Him (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a> records a season of David&#8217;s life marked by concealment in natural fortresses, relentless royal hostility, and continuous divine protection. Each clause unfolds a facet of God&#8217;s providence: strategic placement in wilderness strongholds, precise geography in Ziph, the press of daily pursuit, and the decisive safeguard of the Lord. The verse teaches that while human opposition may be unremitting, God&#8217;s commitment to His promises is unbreakable; therefore, His chosen servant remains secure until every purpose is complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The wilderness of Ziph.</span>--This wilderness probably lies between Hebron and En-gedi. Some of these "stations" in the wanderings of the future king are only doubtfully identified. Cowper's musical--though perhaps, according to our recent canons of taste, old-fashioned--lines well describe the Psalmist-king's weary wanderings during this portion of his chequered career:--<p>"See Judah's promised king bereft of all,<p>Driven out an exile from the face of Saul.<p>To distant caves the lonely wanderer flies,<p>To seek that peace a tyrant's frown denies.<p>His soul exults; hope animates his lays;<p>The sense of mercy kindles into praise;<p>And wilds familiar with the lion s roar<p>Ring with ecstatic sounds unheard before."<p>COWPER.<p><span class= "bld">Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him.</span>--This is merely a general remark, and intended to cover a long period of time, including the remaining portion of Saul's reign, during which David was perpetually exposed to Saul's attempts to destroy him. It quietly mentions also that though Saul was armed with all the power of the king in Israel, he was powerless, for the invisible King of Israel declined to give this hated David into his hand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strong holds.</span> Natural fortresses in the woods and mountains are meant, and places difficult of access. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Ziph.</span> This lay to the south of Hebron, upon the edge of the great desert of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saul sought him every day.</span> The pursuit was maintained constantly, with men always spying David's movements, and ready to report to Saul any opportunity of seizing him;
