His relationship with his armor-bearer reflects the military practices of ancient Israel, where a warrior often had a young assistant to carry his weapons. This partnership is reminiscent of other biblical pairs, such as David and his armor-bearer, highlighting the importance of loyalty and support in battle. Jonathan's initiative contrasts with his father's hesitance, showcasing his leadership qualities.<p><b>Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men</b><br>The term "uncircumcised" is used to describe the Philistines, emphasizing their status as non-Israelites and covenant outsiders. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, and this phrase underscores the spiritual and cultural divide between the Israelites and their enemies. The Philistines were a significant threat during this period, often clashing with Israel. Jonathan's proposal to cross over indicates a bold and proactive approach to confronting the enemy, reflecting his faith and determination.<p><b>Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf</b><br>Jonathan's statement reveals his reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength. The use of "perhaps" indicates humility and recognition of God's sovereignty. This echoes other biblical instances where faith in God's power leads to victory, such as Gideon's battle against the Midianites. Jonathan's faith is not presumptuous but hopeful, trusting in God's ability to deliver His people.<p><b>Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving</b><br>This declaration of faith highlights the omnipotence of God. Jonathan acknowledges that God's ability to save is not limited by human constraints. This belief is consistent with other biblical narratives where God delivers His people against overwhelming odds, such as the parting of the Red Sea or the fall of Jericho. It underscores the theme of divine power and providence throughout Scripture.<p><b>Whether by many or by few</b><br>Jonathan's confidence that God can save regardless of numbers reflects a recurring biblical theme: God's strength is made perfect in weakness. This is seen in stories like David and Goliath, where a seemingly weaker individual triumphs through God's power. It also foreshadows New Testament teachings, such as Jesus feeding the 5,000 with limited resources, demonstrating that God's provision is not dependent on human means. Jonathan's faith serves as a model for believers, encouraging trust in God's ability to accomplish His purposes through any circumstance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

His words reveal personal courage and a heart tuned to God&#8217;s purposes (compare <a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of an armor-bearer shows the seriousness of the mission; he will carry weapons and fight alongside Jonathan (see <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> for David in a similar role).<p>&#8226; Faith often begins with a conversation&#8212;someone speaks vision into another&#8217;s heart. Jonathan&#8217;s initiative echoes Joshua&#8217;s call to spies in <a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> and foreshadows David rallying his men in <a href="/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cross over&#8221; signals movement from safety into enemy territory, a physical act of faith much like Israel crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling the Philistines &#8220;uncircumcised&#8221; reminds us they are outside God&#8217;s covenant. Jonathan views the battle theologically, not merely militarily. David will use the same description of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Outpost suggests a small garrison, yet Jonathan sees a strategic opportunity. God&#8217;s people need not wait for perfect conditions; obedience is enough (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Perhaps&#8221; does not signal doubt in God&#8217;s power but humility about His sovereign plan (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17-18</a>; <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>). Jonathan trusts God yet leaves room for divine freedom.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Work on our behalf&#8221; shows personal reliance on the covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH). Jonathan expects God to act for His people as He did in <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7-10</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10-12</a>.<p>&#8226; True faith balances confidence with submission, stepping out while acknowledging, &#8220;If the Lord wills&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jonathan states a timeless truth: God&#8217;s deliverance is not limited by human resources (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; History supports him&#8212;Gideon&#8217;s 300 (<a href="/bsb/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>), Asa&#8217;s out-numbered army (<a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14</a>), and the lone prophet Elijah at Carmel (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>) all experienced victory because the Lord saved.<p>&#8226; The statement encourages bold obedience even when numbers, finances, or influence seem inadequate (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; 44:6-7).<p>&#8226; It also guards against pride when resources are abundant; salvation is the Lord&#8217;s work from start to finish (<a href="/jonah/2-9.htm">Jonah 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s words in <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a> reveal a heart that knows God personally, sees circumstances through a covenant lens, acts humbly yet boldly, and rests in the certainty that the Lord&#8217;s saving power is never constrained by human limitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And Jonathan said.</span>--This companion in arms answered to the esquire of the knight of the middle ages. Gideon, Joab, David, and others of the famous Israelite warriors, were constantly accompanied in a similar manner by an armour-bearer.<p><span class= "bld">Come, and let us go over.</span>--Although in this history of the great deed of Jonathan there is no mention of the "Spirit of the Lord" having come upon him, as in the case of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>), Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>), Samson, and others--who, in order to enable them to accomplish a particular act, were temporarily endowed with superhuman strength and courage and wisdom--there is no shadow of doubt but that in this case the "Spirit of the Lord" descended on the heroic son of Saul. All the circumstances connected with this event, which had so marked an influence on the fortunes of Israel, are evidently supernatural. The brave though desperate thought which suggested the attack, the courage and strength needful to carry it out, the strange panic which seized the Philistine garrison, the utter dismay which spread over the whole of the Philistine forces, and which caused them to fly in utter confusion before the small bands of Israelites, all belong to the same class of incidents so common in the earlier Hebrew story, when it is clear that the Glorious Arm of the Eternal helped them in a way it helped no other peoples.<p>The term "uncircumcised" is commonly applied to the Philistines, and to other of the enemies of Israel. It is used as a special term of reproach. The enmity between Philistia and Israel lasted over a long period, and was very bitter.<p><span class= "bld">It may be that the Lord will work for us.</span>--These words explain the apparent recklessness of Jonathan's attempt. It was Another who would fight the armed garrison on those tall peaks opposite, and bring him safely back to his people again.<p><span class= "bld">For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.</span>--"O Divine power of faith, which makes a man more than men. The question is not what Jonathan can do, but what God can do, whose power is not in the means, but in Himself. There is no restraint in the Lord to save by many or by few. O admirable faith in Jonathan, whom neither the steepness of the rocks nor multitude of enemies can dissuade from such an assault."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Hall.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>. An epithet of dislike almost confined to the Philistines. But underneath the whole speech of Jonathan lies the conviction of the covenant relation of Israel to Jehovah, of which circumcision was the outward sign.
