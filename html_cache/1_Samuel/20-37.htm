Jonathan, the son of King Saul, is helping David discern Saul's intentions. The "boy" here is a servant used by Jonathan to retrieve arrows, a common practice in ancient times for archery training. The location is significant as it is a field outside of Gibeah, Saul's capital, providing privacy for Jonathan and David's secret communication. This setting underscores the tension and danger surrounding David, who is fleeing from Saul's wrath. The use of a boy to retrieve arrows is a clever ruse, allowing Jonathan to communicate with David without arousing suspicion.<p><b>Jonathan called to him</b><br>Jonathan's call to the boy is part of a prearranged signal to communicate with David. This reflects the deep trust and friendship between Jonathan and David, as well as Jonathan's loyalty to David despite his father Saul's hostility. The act of calling out is a subtle yet effective way to convey a message without direct confrontation, highlighting the wisdom and discretion required in their situation. This moment also illustrates Jonathan's role as a mediator and protector, foreshadowing the protective role of Christ as an intercessor.<p><b>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the arrow beyond you?&#8221;</b><br>This question is the key part of the signal to David. If Jonathan had said the arrow was beside the boy, it would have meant safety for David. However, saying it is beyond indicates danger, confirming Saul's intent to harm David. This phrase is a turning point, marking the moment David must flee and live as a fugitive. The use of an arrow, a weapon, as a means of communication is symbolic of the threat against David's life. This moment of revelation parallels the prophetic nature of scripture, where hidden truths are revealed through signs and symbols. The phrase also echoes the theme of divine guidance and protection, as David's life is preserved through Jonathan's intervention, much like God's providential care for His chosen ones throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
