Samuel, a prophet who had died, is brought up, which raises questions about the afterlife and the prohibition against necromancy in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>. The disturbance of Samuel suggests a violation of divine order, as God had ceased communication with Saul due to his disobedience. This moment underscores the seriousness of seeking forbidden spiritual practices.<p><b>&#8220;I am deeply distressed,&#8221; replied Saul.</b><br>Saul's distress highlights his desperation and fear. The Philistines, a constant threat to Israel, were advancing, and Saul felt abandoned. This emotional turmoil reflects Saul's spiritual decline and the consequences of his earlier disobedience, such as failing to completely destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15). His distress is compounded by the absence of divine guidance, illustrating the spiritual void in his leadership.<p><b>&#8220;The Philistines are fighting against me,</b><br>The Philistines were a formidable enemy of Israel, often mentioned throughout the books of Samuel. Their military prowess and strategic locations posed significant threats. This conflict is part of a larger narrative of Israel's struggle to establish itself in the Promised Land. Saul's inability to effectively deal with the Philistines contrasts with David's later successes, highlighting the shift in divine favor.<p><b>and God has turned away from me.</b><br>Saul's acknowledgment of God's departure is a pivotal moment. It reflects the fulfillment of Samuel's earlier prophecy that the kingdom would be torn from Saul due to his disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). This turning away signifies a loss of divine favor and guidance, a theme echoed in other scriptures where God withdraws from those who persist in sin (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><b>He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams.</b><br>In ancient Israel, God communicated through prophets, dreams, and the Urim and Thummim. Saul's lack of communication from God indicates a severed relationship, as these were primary means of divine guidance. This silence contrasts with the active communication God had with David, emphasizing the consequences of Saul's disobedience and the importance of maintaining a faithful relationship with God.<p><b>So I have called on you to tell me what to do.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's decision to consult Samuel, even through forbidden means, underscores his desperation. It reflects a misguided attempt to seek guidance outside of God's will, highlighting the dangers of turning to occult practices. This act is a culmination of Saul's spiritual decline and foreshadows his impending downfall. It serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of obedience and reliance on God alone for guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who had died prior to this event.

Keil, however, rightly concludes that these words by themselves do not decide the question as to <span class= "ital">what </span>power called up the "spirit." They simply assert that Samuel had been disturbed from his rest by Saul, and ask the reason why. In the Babylonian Talmud there is a remarkable comment on these words of the shade of the departed prophet. "Rabbi Elazar said, when he read this Scripture text, 'Why hast thou disquieted me?' If Samuel the righteous was afraid of the Judgment (to which he thought he was summoned when thus called up), how much more ought we to be afraid of the Judgment? And whence do we infer that Samuel was afraid? Because it is written, 'And the woman said unto Saul, I saw mighty ones [or perhaps judges]--Elohim--ascending out of the earth: <span class= "ital">olim, </span>ascending (a <span class= "ital">plural </span>form), implies at least two, and one of them was Samuel; <span class= "ital">who, </span>then, was the other?

The Talmud, treatise <span class= "ital">Berachoth, </span>xii. 2, gives the probable answer. Saul knew the Urim was no longer in his kingdom.
