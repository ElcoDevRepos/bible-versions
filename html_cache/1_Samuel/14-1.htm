As the crown prince, Jonathan holds a significant position in Israel's monarchy. His name means "Yahweh has given," reflecting the divine favor upon him. Jonathan is known for his bravery and faith, qualities that are evident in this passage. His relationship with his father, Saul, is complex, as Saul's reign is marked by disobedience to God, leading to his eventual rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). Jonathan's actions often contrast with Saul's, highlighting his own faithfulness and courage.<p><b>said to the young man bearing his armor</b><br>The "young man bearing his armor" refers to Jonathan's armor-bearer, a position of trust and responsibility. Armor-bearers were typically young men who assisted warriors in battle, carrying their weapons and providing support. This role required loyalty and bravery, as they often accompanied their masters into dangerous situations. The close relationship between Jonathan and his armor-bearer is indicative of Jonathan's leadership and ability to inspire confidence in those around him.<p><b>&#8220;Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan's initiative to cross over to the Philistine outpost demonstrates his proactive and daring nature. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles for control of territory. The "outpost" refers to a military garrison, likely positioned strategically to monitor and control movement in the area. Jonathan's decision to confront the Philistines without a large army underscores his faith in God's ability to deliver Israel, reminiscent of David's later confrontation with Goliath (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>But Jonathan did not tell his father.</b><br>Jonathan's choice not to inform Saul of his plan suggests a lack of confidence in his father's leadership or a desire to act independently. Saul's previous failures, such as his unlawful sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9-14</a>), may have contributed to Jonathan's decision. This secrecy also highlights the tension between Jonathan's faith-driven actions and Saul's increasingly erratic behavior. Jonathan's reliance on God rather than human authority foreshadows the eventual rise of David, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

Jonathan was the typical warrior of that wild and adventurous age--recklessly brave, chivalrous, and generous, possessing evidently vast strength and unusual skill in all warlike exercises. He was animated with an intense faith in the willingness and power of the Eternal to help Israel. This mighty faith in the ever-presence of the God who chose Israel, was the mainspring of the victorious power of all the great Hebrew heroes--of men like Joshua and Gideon, Barak and Samson. David, the greatest of them all, we shall see, possessed this sublime spirit of faith in a pre-eminent degree. But King Saul utterly lacked it; hence his rejection.<p>The young prince's heart burned within him at the degradation which the Philistine occupation brought upon the people. His father was too prudent to engage in battle with his own feeble and disorganised forces, so Jonathan determined, with the help of the Divine Friend of Israel, to strike a blow at these insolent foes. Under any other circumstances--without the consciousness of supernatural help--to attempt such a feat of arms would have been madness; but Jonathan had an inward conviction that an unseen Arm would hold a shield before him. It is noticeable that he never communicated his desperate purpose to his father, Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it came to pass upon a day.</span> Literally, "And there was a day, and Jonathan," etc.; or, as we should say, And it happened one day that Jonathan. The phrase means that Jonathan's brave feat took place not many days after the garrison had occupied the cliff, probably only two or three, but without definitely stating how many. <span class="cmt_word">He told not his father.</span> Not only because Saul would have forbidden so rash an enterprise, but because secrecy was essential to any chance of success: probably too the purpose came upon him as an inspiration from above. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
