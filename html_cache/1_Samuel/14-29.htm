This oath is seen as impulsive and detrimental, as it weakened the troops during a critical time of battle against the Philistines. The phrase "brought trouble" echoes the language used in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>, where Achan's sin brought trouble upon Israel. This highlights the consequences of disobedience and poor leadership. Saul's decision reflects a lack of wisdom and discernment, contrasting with Jonathan's more pragmatic and faithful approach.<p><b>"Just look at how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey."</b><br>The brightening of Jonathan's eyes symbolizes renewed strength and vitality, which he gained from eating the honey. In the ancient Near East, honey was a common source of quick energy and was often found in the wild, as in this instance. The physical effect of the honey on Jonathan underscores the practical need for sustenance, especially in times of war. This incident also serves as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment, where the Word of God is often likened to honey (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>). Jonathan's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers spiritual sustenance and refreshment to those who partake in Him. The contrast between Saul's legalism and Jonathan's practical wisdom highlights the importance of understanding and applying God's laws with discernment and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faithfulness.

Scripture often links unwise leadership with national distress&#8212;think of Achan&#8217;s sin that &#8220;troubled&#8221; Israel at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>) or Elijah&#8217;s charge that Ahab &#8220;troubled Israel&#8221; by forsaking the LORD (<a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>). Jonathan&#8217;s words affirm that disobedience or legalism at the top ripples outward, stalling God-given victories and draining morale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jonathan replied</b><p>In voicing respectful but honest dissent, Jonathan models courageous integrity. He doesn&#8217;t undermine Saul&#8217;s authority publicly; rather, he answers the immediate criticism (v. 28) with truth. <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5&#8211;6</a> praises &#8220;open rebuke&#8221; over hidden love; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a> shows believers obeying God rather than men when commands conflict. Jonathan thus demonstrates that loyalty to family and kingdom never overrides loyalty to God&#8217;s clear purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just look at how my eyes have brightened</b><p>Physical renewal illustrates spiritual principle: God&#8217;s gifts are meant to strengthen, not stifle, His people. <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14&#8211;15</a> celebrates food that &#8220;gladdens the heart&#8221; and &#8220;sustains man&#8217;s spirit.&#8221; In the New Testament, Jesus refuses legalistic fasting when the Bridegroom is present (<a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14&#8211;15</a>). Jonathan&#8217;s clear eyesight contrasts with the soldiers&#8217; faintness (<a href="/1_samuel/14-28.htm">1 Samuel 14:28, 31</a>), hinting that human rules often dim vision while God&#8217;s provision enlightens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because I tasted a little of this honey</b><p>Honey, a symbol of blessing (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>), becomes evidence of how simple obedience to creation&#8217;s bounty refreshes. Saul&#8217;s oath barred a legitimate resource and pushed the troops toward later sin&#8212;eating meat with blood (<a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>). <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20&#8211;23</a> warns against man-made regulations that &#8220;have an appearance of wisdom&#8221; but lack value against the flesh. Jonathan&#8217;s small act of tasting underscores that liberty under God&#8217;s Word brings life; burdensome additions bring trouble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s brief statement exposes the folly of legalistic leadership, affirms courageous truth-telling, and illustrates how enjoying God&#8217;s rightful provisions renews strength and clarity. Where human rules eclipse divine wisdom, trouble follows; where believers receive God&#8217;s gifts with gratitude and discernment, eyes brighten and victory advances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">My father hath troubled the land.</span>--In other words, "My father's ill-considered vow has done-grave harm to us in Israel.
