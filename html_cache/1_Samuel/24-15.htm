This appeal to divine judgment underscores David's faith in God's justice rather than taking matters into his own hands. The context is David's encounter with Saul in the cave, where David spares Saul's life, demonstrating his respect for God's anointed king despite Saul's pursuit to kill him. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where kingship was seen as divinely appointed. David's reliance on God as judge also prefigures the New Testament teaching that Christ will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<p><b>May He take notice and plead my case</b><br>David's request for God to "take notice" and "plead my case" indicates his desire for divine advocacy. This reflects the biblical theme of God as the defender of the innocent and the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, legal disputes were often resolved by appealing to a higher authority, and David seeks God's intervention as the highest authority. This plea for divine advocacy can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as our advocate with the Father (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>), interceding on behalf of believers.<p><b>and deliver me from your hand.&#8221;</b><br>David's request for deliverance from Saul's hand highlights his trust in God's power to save. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God as a deliverer, as seen in the Exodus story where God delivers Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The phrase also connects to the Psalms, where David frequently calls upon God for deliverance from his enemies (<a href="/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>). This reliance on divine deliverance foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>). David's faith in God's deliverance serves as a model for believers to trust in God's saving power in times of trouble.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

Just as <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a> calls Him &#8220;the Judge of all the earth,&#8221; David trusts God to weigh each heart (<a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>). Doing so keeps him from acting on impulse and lines him up with <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and decide between you and me</b><p>Rather than insisting on his side of the story, David invites God to render the verdict. He echoes the principle later voiced in <a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD will repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness&#8221;. Solomon prays the same way in <a href="/1_kings/8-32.htm">1 Kings 8:32</a>, confident God will &#8220;condemn the wicked&#8230; and justify the righteous.&#8221; David leaves room for a decision only God can make.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May He take notice and plead my case</b><p>This line shifts from court language to personal advocacy. David believes the LORD not only sees but also argues on behalf of the innocent (<a href="/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>). <a href="/psalms/35-1.htm">Psalm 35:1</a> captures the same plea: &#8220;Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me&#8221;. Knowing God is near, David rests in the assurance <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a> celebrates: &#8220;He who vindicates Me is near.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and deliver me from your hand</b><p>Finally, David asks for rescue, trusting God&#8217;s timing instead of seizing the chance to kill Saul. <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> promises, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles&#8221;. Paul echoes that confidence in <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17&#8211;18</a>. David&#8217;s restraint shows the belief that the same God who judges and pleads will also &#8220;rescue me from my strong enemy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a> walks through a four-step trust in God: judge, decide, plead, deliver. David refuses self-vindication and places every stage of justice in the LORD&#8217;s hands. In doing so he preserves his integrity, honors God&#8217;s chosen king, and demonstrates unshakable faith in the righteous Judge who always rules at the perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</span>--Shall I lay these hands on the Lord's Anointed?
