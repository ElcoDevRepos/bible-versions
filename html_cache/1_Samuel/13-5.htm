Their presence in the land was a constant threat to the Israelites, often leading to military confrontations. The Philistines were known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, which gave them an advantage over the Israelites. This assembly indicates a large-scale military campaign, reflecting the ongoing struggle for dominance in the region.<p><b>with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen,</b><br>The mention of chariots and horsemen highlights the military might and technological superiority of the Philistines. Chariots were a formidable force in ancient warfare, providing speed and power on the battlefield. The number of chariots and horsemen suggests a well-organized and heavily equipped army, posing a significant threat to the less technologically advanced Israelite forces. This disparity underscores the reliance of Israel on divine intervention for victory, as seen in previous battles such as those led by Joshua.<p><b>and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore.</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the overwhelming size of the Philistine army. The phrase "as numerous as the sand on the seashore" is a common biblical idiom used to describe vast numbers, also seen in God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The imagery conveys the seemingly insurmountable odds faced by Israel, setting the stage for a narrative where faith and divine assistance are crucial for overcoming human limitations.<p><b>They went up and camped at Michmash,</b><br>Michmash was a strategic location in the central highlands of Israel, north of Jerusalem. Its elevation provided a tactical advantage, allowing the Philistines to control the surrounding area and threaten the Israelite heartland. The choice of Michmash as a campsite indicates the Philistines' intent to establish a stronghold and launch further incursions into Israelite territory. This location would later become significant in the narrative of Jonathan's daring attack on the Philistine outpost (1 Samuel 14).<p><b>east of Beth-aven.</b><br>Beth-aven, meaning "house of wickedness," was near Bethel, a site with religious significance for Israel. The proximity to Beth-aven may symbolize the encroachment of pagan influence and the threat to Israel's spiritual and national identity. The Philistines' position east of Beth-aven suggests a direct challenge to Israel's control and a test of their faithfulness to God.

In the rolls of ancient armies (and we possess many a one in the sacred records) the number of war chariots is always smaller than that of the horsemen; here the chariots are represented as four times as numerous. In the rolls of the most famous armies there never appear anything like this number. For instance, Jabin (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.">Judges 4:3</a>) had 900 chariots. Pharaoh pursued Israel with 600. When David defeated Syria, the great Syrian army had 40,000 horsemen and 700 chariots. King Solomon is only reported (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm" title="And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.">1Kings 10:26</a>) to have possessed 1,400 chariots. Zerah the Ethiopian had but 300 in his vast army, and the Pharaoh Shishak 1,200. Here the more probable reading would be "300" not 30,000. Bishop Wordsworth endeavours to explain the vast array by a reference to Josephus, who relates that this Philistine force was composed of various nations; but this would never account for the incredible number of chariots. The Philistines evidently lost no time. While Saul was endeavouring to rally at Gilgal a Hebrew army, Philistia at once, with the aid of foreign allies, took the field, and with a large army--for it is clear their host on this occasion was very large--encamped no great distance from Gilgal, evidently determined once and for all to crush their enemies and their recently-elected daring king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Long before Saul could gather Israel the Philistines had completed their preparations, and invaded the country in overwhelming numbers; but <span class="cmt_word">thirty thousand chariots</span> compared with <span class="cmt_word">six thousand horsemen</span> is out of all proportion. Possibly the final <span class="accented">l</span> in Israel has been taken by some copyists for a numeral, and as it signifies thirty, it his changed 1000 into 30,000. Or, simpler still, <span class="accented">shin</span>, the numeral for 300, has been read with two dots, and so changed into 30,000. <span class="cmt_word">They came up, and pitched in Michmash.</span> Saul had withdrawn eastward to Gilgal, and the Philistines had thus placed themselves between him and Jonathan. There is a difficulty, however, in the words <span class="cmt_word">eastward from Beth-aven;</span> for as this, again, was east of Bethel, it puts the Philistines' camp too much to the east. As it is not, however, the regular phrase for eastward, some commentators render, "in front of Beth-avon." "It means 'the house of naught,' and was the name originally given to the desert east of Bethel, because of its barren character" (Conder, 'Tent Work,' 2:108). The Philistines, however, had come in such numbers that their camp must have occupied a large extent of ground. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
