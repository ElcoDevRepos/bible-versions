Saul's jealousy and fear of losing his throne drove him to this extreme measure. This order reflects the deepening of Saul's spiritual decline, as he moves further away from God's will. The command also highlights the tension within Saul's household, as Jonathan, Saul's son, had formed a close bond with David. This internal conflict foreshadows the eventual division within Israel. The order to involve "all his servants" indicates Saul's desperation and the extent of his paranoia, as he seeks to enlist the entire royal court in his personal vendetta. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, setting the stage for David's eventual rise and Saul's downfall.<p><b>But Jonathan delighted greatly in David,</b><br>Jonathan's delight in David underscores the deep friendship and covenantal bond between the two, which is one of the most profound relationships depicted in the Bible. Despite being the heir to Saul's throne, Jonathan recognizes David's anointing and God's favor upon him. This delight is not merely personal affection but also spiritual discernment, as Jonathan sees God's hand in David's life. Jonathan's loyalty to David over his father Saul is a testament to his integrity and faithfulness to God's purposes. This relationship is a type of Christ's love for humanity, characterized by selflessness and sacrifice. Jonathan's actions foreshadow the New Testament teaching of loving one's neighbor and putting others before oneself, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The latter is the rendering of the LXX. and the Syriac. The murderous impulse of the unhappy Saul gradually increased in intensity. First, it showed itself only in the paroxysms of insanity, when the half distraught king would grasp and poise his heavy spear, as though he would hurl it at the kindly musician as he tried to calm the troubled spirit. Then it would plot and scheme against the hated life, trying to involve this young soldier in some enterprise fraught with deadly peril. Now he speaks openly to his heir and his counsellors of the risk incurred by suffering so dangerous a man to live.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul spake to Jonathan his son...that they should kill David.</span> The translation of the last clause is untenable; it really means "about killing David," and so both the Septuagint and the Syriac render it. The descent of men once full of noble impulses, as was the case with Saul, into open crime is gradual, and with many halts on the way. Saul first gave way to envy, and instead of struggling against his bad feelings, nourished them. Then, when scarcely accountable for his actions, he threatened David's life; and next, with growing malice, encouraged him in dangerous undertakings, in the hope that in one of them he might be slain. And now he goes one step farther. He talks to Jonathan and his officers concerning the many reasons there were for David's death; argues that without it there will be no security for himself and his dynasty; represents David probably as a traitor, with secret purposes of usurping the throne; and reveals what hitherto had been but the half-formed wishes of his heart. But even now, probably, he still spoke of David's death as a painful necessity, and had many misgivings in his own mind. But he was really encouraging himself in crime, and by cherishing thoughts of murder he was gradually descending towards the dark abyss into which he finally fell. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
