The ephod often contained the Urim and Thummim, used for decision-making. This highlights the religious practices of the time and the role of the priesthood in Israel. The ephod signifies Ahijah's authority and his role in spiritual matters, reflecting the importance of seeking God's will in leadership decisions.<p><b>He was the son of Ichabod&#8217;s brother Ahitub</b><br>Ahijah's lineage is traced back to Ichabod, whose name means "the glory has departed," a reference to the loss of the Ark of the Covenant to the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>). This connection underscores the ongoing consequences of Israel's earlier failures and the spiritual decline that had occurred. Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, continues the priestly line, indicating the persistence of God's covenant despite human failure.<p><b>son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh.</b><br>This genealogy connects Ahijah to Eli, the high priest whose family suffered judgment due to the sins of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-36</a>). Eli's priesthood was marked by corruption, leading to God's pronouncement of judgment. The mention of Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located, emphasizes the historical and religious significance of this priestly line. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for faithful leadership.<p><b>But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left.</b><br>Jonathan's departure without the knowledge of the troops highlights his initiative and courage. This act of faith contrasts with Saul's hesitance and reliance on human strategies. Jonathan's actions demonstrate trust in God's power rather than military might, foreshadowing the victory that follows. This phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding narrative, where Jonathan's faith leads to a significant triumph over the Philistines, illustrating the theme of divine intervention and the importance of individual faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahijah.htm">Ahijah</a></b><br>A priest during the time of King Saul, identified as the son of Ahitub and the brother of Ichabod.

While Saul hesitates, another drama is unfolding. Jonathan and his armor-bearer have slipped away (<a href="/1_samuel/14-1.htm">1 Samuel 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse highlights who is present with Saul and what they are (and are not) doing, setting the contrast between royal inaction and Jonathan&#8217;s faith-filled initiative (cf. <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-14</a>, where Gideon moves forward while others hide).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Introducing Ahijah</b><p>&#8220;And Ahijah &#8230; was wearing an ephod.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ahijah is the acting priest on the scene.

Saul&#8217;s silence here foreshadows his drift toward self-reliance (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The explicit mention reminds readers that divine direction was available in the camp, heightening the irony that Jonathan, not Saul, steps out in faith (cf. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The priestly lineage</b><p>&#8220;He was the son of Ichabod&#8217;s brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This genealogy ties Ahijah to the line of Eli, whose house had been judged (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>; 3:11-14).<p>&#8226; Though judgment fell, God in mercy still provides priests to serve Israel, demonstrating His covenant faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s history also warns that religious position without obedience leads to loss of glory (&#8220;Ichabod,&#8221; <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>).

The army, oblivious to Jonathan&#8217;s departure, underscores the king&#8217;s spiritual dullness. Together, these details magnify the truth that God&#8217;s deliverance comes through those who actively depend on Him, not through mere religious trappings or titles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Ahiah, the son of Ahitub.</span>--The Chronicles, rehearsing these facts, show us what a terrible impression the last events in Eli's reign as high priest had made in Israel. The destruction of Shiloh, the death of the high priest, the fall of Phinehas and his brother in battle, the melancholy circumstances of the birth of I-chabod, were still fresh in the memory of the people. Well might Jonathan be ready to sacrifice himself if he could deal an effectual blow upon these hereditary enemies of his country. Of this high priest Ahiah we never hear again in these Books of Samuel. He is generally supposed to be the same as the high priest Ahimelech, who was subsequently murdered by Doeg, by the direction of Saul, with the priests at Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm" title="Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.">1Samuel 22:9</a>, &c.). The name Ahiah signifies "brother," or "friend of the Eternal"; Ahimelech, "brother of the king," may be another form of the same name.<p><span class= "bld">Wearing an ephod.</span>--The ephod here alluded to is not the ordinary priestly vestment of white linen, but that official garment worn alone by the high priest, in which was the breast-plate of gems with the mysterious Urim and Thummim, by which inquiry used to be made of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahiah, the son of Ahitub.</span> (See on 1 Samuel 13:9.) It is interesting to find the house of Eli recovering at last from its disaster, and one of its members duly ministering in his office before the king. It has been debated whether he was the same person as Ahimelech, mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>, etc., the supposition being grounded on the fact that Ahiah is never spoken of again. But he may have died; and with regard to the argument drawn from the similarity of the names, we must notice that names compounded with <span class="accented">Ah</span> (or Ach), brother, were common in Eli's family, while compounds with <span class="accented">Ab</span>, father, were most in use among Saul's relatives. Ahiah or Ahijah means <span class="accented">Jah is brother</span>; his father is Ahitub, <span class="accented">the brother is good</span>; why should he not call another son Ahimelech, <span class="accented">the brother is king?</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah's priest in Shiloh.</span> This refers to Eli, the regular rule in Hebrew being that all such statements belong, not to the son, but to the father. <span class="cmt_word">Wearing an ephod.</span> Literally, ephod bearing. The ephod, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:18, was the usual ministerial garment; but what is meant here is not an ordinary ephod of linen, but that described in <a href="/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7, 8</a>, <span class="accented">wherein was the breastplate, by which Jehovah's will was made known to his people, until prophecy took its place. All this, the former part of the verse, must be regarded as a parenthesis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">including Ahijah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
