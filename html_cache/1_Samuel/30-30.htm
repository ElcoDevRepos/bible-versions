The name "Hormah" means "destruction" or "devotion to destruction," which is significant in biblical history. It was originally called Zephath and was destroyed by the Israelites during their conquest of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>). This city represents a place of victory and judgment, as it was devoted to destruction in fulfillment of God's command. The mention of Hormah in this context highlights the ongoing relationship between David and the people of Judah, as he shares the spoils of his victory with them, fostering unity and support.<p><b>Bor-ashan</b><br>Bor-ashan is a less well-known location, and its exact site is not definitively identified today. The name may mean "well of smoke" or "pit of smoke," suggesting a place that might have been associated with a natural feature like a well or a pit. This location is mentioned in the context of David distributing the spoils of war, indicating that it was a place of significance for those receiving the gifts. The inclusion of Bor-ashan in the list of recipients underscores David's strategic and diplomatic efforts to strengthen alliances and support among the various settlements in the region.<p><b>and Athach</b><br>Athach is another location mentioned in the distribution of spoils by David. Like Bor-ashan, its precise location is not known today, and it is not frequently mentioned in biblical texts. The inclusion of Athach in this list suggests that it was a community of some importance or need, deserving of the gifts from David. This act of generosity by David can be seen as a foreshadowing of the kingly role he would later assume, as he demonstrates leadership qualities such as generosity, wisdom, and the ability to unify and support his people. This distribution of spoils also reflects the biblical principle of sharing blessings with others, as seen in the broader narrative of God's provision and care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is leading his men after a significant victory over the Amalekites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hormah.htm">Hormah</a></b><br>A city in the southern part of Judah, historically significant as a place of defeat and later victory for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bor-ashan.htm">Bor-ashan</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the context of David's distribution of spoils, though not much is known about it.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/athach.htm">Athach</a></b><br>Another location receiving part of the spoils, indicating David's widespread influence and generosity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that had raided Ziklag, prompting David's pursuit and eventual victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_in_leadership.htm">Generosity in Leadership</a></b><br>David's distribution of the spoils demonstrates a leader's responsibility to care for and support his people.

David&#8217;s men had just crushed those very raiders (<a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17&#8211;20</a>), so sending a share of the spoil back south was both gratitude and practical relief for a battered frontier.<p>&#8226; Centuries earlier Israel tasted defeat at Hormah (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>) but later won a decisive victory there (<a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1-3</a>; <a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>). David&#8217;s gift turns a place once marked by loss into a place marked by blessing&#8212;evidence that the LORD can reverse history&#8217;s bitter chapters.<p>&#8226; By naming the treasure &#8220;the spoil of the LORD&#8217;s enemies&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>) David reminds Hormah&#8217;s elders that the victory&#8212;and the tithe of generosity&#8212;belongs to God. He models the same principle Paul later celebrates when Christ &#8220;gave gifts to men&#8221; after His triumph (<a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bor-ashan</b><p>&#8220;to those in Bor-ashan&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a>)<p>&#8226; Bor-ashan is probably the same &#8220;Ashan&#8221; listed among Simeon&#8217;s towns inside Judah&#8217;s territory (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>). Though small, it lay within David&#8217;s future kingdom, so this care package quietly knits Simeon and Judah together.<p>&#8226; David treats rustic Bor-ashan with the same honor he shows larger centers like Hebron (<a href="/1_samuel/30-31.htm">1 Samuel 30:31</a>). The shepherd-king sees no flock too minor to notice&#8212;foreshadowing the Good Shepherd who leaves ninety-nine to seek one (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, David insisted that those who guarded the baggage share equally with the frontline soldiers (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>). Bor-ashan&#8217;s inclusion extends that same principle: unseen villages share in the victory&#8217;s joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Athach</b><p>&#8220;to those in Athach&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a>)<p>&#8226; Athach&#8217;s exact location is lost, yet its mention proves David&#8217;s memory for every outpost that had sheltered him during Saul&#8217;s persecution (compare <a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 24</a>&#8211;25). The king-in-waiting repays past kindness with tangible blessing.<p>&#8226; By listing Athach alongside better-known towns, Scripture affirms that no act of faithfulness is forgotten by God (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s outreach also serves a strategic purpose: when Judah later gathers to crown him (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>), villages like Athach will already trust his leadership because they have tasted his generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a> David sends portions of the Amalekite plunder &#8220;to those in Hormah, to those in Bor-ashan, and to those in Athach,&#8221; extending the same gift he sent to other Judean elders. Each town illustrates a facet of godly leadership:<p>&#8226; Hormah&#8212;God turns former defeat into present blessing.<p>&#8226; Bor-ashan&#8212;No community is too small for the king&#8217;s care.<p>&#8226; Athach&#8212;Past loyalty is rewarded, and nothing done for the LORD is overlooked.<p>The verse shows David binding Judah together through generosity that honors the LORD as the true Victor, a pattern ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who shares the spoils of His triumph with all who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Hormah . . .
