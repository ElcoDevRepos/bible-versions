He is described in earlier passages as a man of wealth and standing from the tribe of Benjamin. This tribal affiliation is significant, as Benjamin was the smallest of the tribes, highlighting God's choice of leadership from unexpected places. Kish's lineage is important in establishing Saul's legitimacy and connection to the tribe of Benjamin, which plays a role in the tribal dynamics of Israel.<p><b>and Abner&#8217;s father Ner</b><br>Ner is the father of Abner, who is Saul's cousin and the commander of his army. Abner's role as a military leader is crucial in the narrative of Saul's reign, as he is involved in many of the military campaigns and political maneuvers. The mention of Ner connects Abner to the same family line as Saul, emphasizing the familial ties that often influenced positions of power and leadership in ancient Israel.<p><b>were sons of Abiel.</b><br>Abiel is the common ancestor of both Kish and Ner, making Saul and Abner first cousins. This familial connection underscores the close-knit nature of leadership within the tribe of Benjamin. The name Abiel means "God is my father," which may reflect the religious heritage and theocratic understanding of leadership in Israel. The genealogical detail serves to authenticate the historical and familial context of Saul's rise to kingship, as well as the interconnectedness of key figures in his administration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God chose Israel&#8217;s first king from a real, traceable family, just as He later anchored the Messiah&#8217;s lineage in David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Kish&#8217;s place in Benjamin fulfills Jacob&#8217;s prophetic word that the tribe would be fierce in battle (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>), a trait reflected in Saul&#8217;s early military successes (<a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail parallels earlier genealogical precision, such as <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> and <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Abner&#8217;s father Ner</b><p>Abner, Saul&#8217;s commander, descends from Ner (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>).

The verse affirms the historical precision of Scripture, explains Abner&#8217;s natural allegiance to Saul, and sets the stage for later family-based tensions in Israel&#8217;s monarchy, all while showcasing God&#8217;s sovereign work through identifiable, real families.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">The son of Abiel.</span>--For "son" the commentators mostly agree we must read <span class= "ital">sons. </span>Kish and Ner, we know, were both sons of Abiel.
