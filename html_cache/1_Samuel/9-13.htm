The "high place" refers to a location used for worship and sacrifices, common in ancient Israel before the temple was built in Jerusalem. High places were often on elevated ground, symbolizing closeness to God. Samuel's presence at the high place indicates his role as a spiritual leader. The immediacy of "as soon as you enter" suggests divine orchestration, emphasizing God's providence in guiding Saul to Samuel.<p><b>The people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice;</b><br>In ancient Israel, it was customary for a priest or prophet to bless a sacrifice before it was consumed. This blessing was an invocation of God's presence and favor. Samuel's role in blessing the sacrifice underscores his authority and the respect he commanded among the people. It also highlights the importance of seeking God's blessing before partaking in communal meals, a practice that reflects the sacredness of fellowship and thanksgiving.<p><b>after that, the guests will eat.</b><br>The sequence of events&#8212;blessing followed by eating&#8212;illustrates the orderliness and reverence in worship practices. It also points to the communal aspect of sacrifices, where the act of eating together signifies unity and shared faith. This practice foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Lord's Supper, where believers partake in communion, remembering Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>Go up at once; you will find him.&#8221;</b><br>The urgency in "go up at once" reflects the divine timing and purpose in Saul's encounter with Samuel. This meeting is pivotal, as it leads to Saul's anointing as the first king of Israel. The phrase "you will find him" assures Saul of God's guidance and the certainty of His plans. This encounter is a turning point in Israel's history, transitioning from the period of judges to the monarchy, and it sets the stage for the eventual rise of David, a type of Christ, who would establish a kingdom foreshadowing the eternal reign of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys and is about to encounter Samuel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and judge of Israel, who is about to meet Saul and anoint him as king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_place.htm">High Place</a></b><br>A location used for worship and sacrifices, often on elevated ground, where Samuel is expected to bless the sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city.htm">City</a></b><br>The unnamed city where Samuel is located, and where Saul is directed to find him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice.htm">Sacrifice</a></b><br>A ritual offering to God, which Samuel is to bless before the people eat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_timing.htm">The Role of Divine Timing</a></b><br>God's timing is perfect, as seen in the precise moment Saul is to meet Samuel.
