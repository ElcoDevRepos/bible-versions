The context is Samuel's warning to the Israelites about the implications of rejecting God as their king in favor of a human monarch. This reflects a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy.<p><b>you will beg for relief</b><br>The Israelites will find themselves oppressed by the very king they desired. This phrase highlights the human tendency to seek relief from self-imposed burdens. It echoes the Israelites' past cries for deliverance from Egyptian slavery, illustrating a recurring cycle of disobedience and repentance.<p><b>from the king you have chosen,</b><br>The emphasis is on the people's choice, underscoring their responsibility for the consequences. This choice marks a significant shift in Israel's governance, as they move away from divine leadership. The phrase foreshadows the reigns of kings like Saul, who would later fail to meet the people's expectations.<p><b>but the LORD will not answer you on that day.&#8221;</b><br>This is a sobering reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's guidance. It reflects a divine judgment where God allows the people to experience the full impact of their decisions. This phrase connects to other instances in Scripture where God temporarily withholds His intervention as a form of discipline, such as in <a href="/judges/10-13.htm">Judges 10:13-14</a>.

The northern tribes broke with all the hallowed associations connected with the Ark and temple, and set up a rival and semi-idolatrous religion in some of their own popular centres. There no holy influences swayed the councils of their despotic kings. The lives of the Israelites who still loved the law of the Lord, and cherished the glorious memories of their fathers, must have been very bitter and hard when men like Omri and Ahab reigned with all their cruel power in Tirzah and Samaria.<p>But no prayers then availed; one wicked dynasty succeeded another, until the cup of iniquity was filled, and Israel carried away captive for ever out of their fair land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall cry.</span> In despair at this cruel oppression ye shall appeal to Jehovah, but in vain. The king was given them at their own request, persisted in even after warning, and they must abide by their choice. It is worth noting that in the northern kingdom a majority of the kings more or less fulfilled Samuel's evil forebodings, and there they were much more completely the product of the temper condemned by the prophet than they were in Judah. The ten tribes roughly snapped the tie which bound them to Jehovah; they discarded the ark and all the services of the sanctuary, and were content with so poor an imitation of them that all piously disposed men were compelled to abandon their lands and migrate into Judaea (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a>); and so the majority of their kings, not being held in check by religious influences, were tyrants. At Jerusalem, on the contrary, most of them were content to remain within the limits of the Mosaic law, and were upon the whole a series of men far superior, not merely to the judges and the monarchs in old time, but to any European dynasty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
