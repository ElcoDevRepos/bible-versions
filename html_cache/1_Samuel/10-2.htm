It underscores the divine orchestration of events, as Samuel, a prophet, speaks with authority about what will happen shortly. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and foreknowledge, as seen in other instances where prophets predict future events (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/13-3.htm">1 Kings 13:3</a>).<p><b>you will find two men at Rachel&#8217;s tomb</b><br>Rachel's tomb is a significant landmark in biblical history, associated with the matriarch Rachel, who died giving birth to Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>). This location serves as a reminder of Israel's heritage and God's promises to the patriarchs. The mention of two men aligns with the biblical principle of establishing truth through multiple witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin</b><br>Zelzah is a location not widely mentioned in Scripture, indicating its obscurity. Its mention here emphasizes the precision of the prophecy. The border of Benjamin is significant as Saul, the recipient of this prophecy, is from the tribe of Benjamin. This geographical detail roots the narrative in the historical and tribal context of Israel.<p><b>They will say to you, &#8216;The donkeys you seek have been found</b><br>The recovery of the donkeys signifies the resolution of a mundane concern, allowing Saul to focus on his divine calling. This reflects a common biblical theme where God addresses practical needs to prepare individuals for greater purposes, as seen in the provision for Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>.<p><b>and now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and started worrying about you</b><br>This shift in concern from the donkeys to Saul highlights the personal nature of God's involvement in individual lives. It underscores the biblical theme of God's care for His people, as seen in Jesus' teaching about God's provision in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>.<p><b>asking, &#8220;What should I do about my son?&#8221;&#8217;</b><br>This question reflects a father's concern and foreshadows Saul's future role as king, where he will be responsible for the welfare of the nation. It also hints at the relational dynamics within Saul's family, which play a role in his later decisions as king. This concern mirrors God's paternal care for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.

Each of these tokens, which were to strengthen the young Saul's faith, contained a solemn lesson, the deep meaning of which, as his life went on, the future sovereign would be able to ponder over. Each of the three signs from heaven met him at one of the sacred spots which were so plentifully dotted over these southern districts of Canaan, memorable for the life-stories, first of Abraham and the patriarchs, and then of the warrior-chieftains of the Israel of the conquest. The selection of localities famous as homes of prayer, or sacred as the resting-place of the illustrious dead, taught the eternal truth "that help comes from the holy place." At the sepulchre of Rachel, the loved ancestress of the warlike tribe of Benjamin, to which the new king belonged, men should meet him on his homeward journey with the news that the lost asses which he had gone to seek were found again. This showed him that henceforth in his new life he was to dismiss all lower cares, and give himself up alone <span class= "ital">to </span>higher and more important matters. A king must take counsel and thought for the weal of a whole people; he must put aside now and for ever all consideration for himself and his family, all anxiety for the mere ordinary prosperity of life. God, who had chosen him, would provide for these things, as He had now done in the case of the lost asses. Further on in his journey, when he reached the terebinth-tree of Tabor, three men on a pilgrimage to the great Beth-el sanctuary would meet him, and would offer him some of the loaves which they proposed offering at Beth-el. The signification of this peculiar gift was that some portion of the products of the soil, which had hitherto been appropriated exclusively to the service and support of the sanctuary, in future should be devoted to the maintenance of the anointed of the Lord. The third sign which he should perceive would meet him as he approached his home, which was situated near a famous holy place of prayer, known as the "Gibeah," or "Hill of God." A number of prophets belonging to one of the "schools" of the prophets founded by Samuel, coming from the altar on the "hill of God," where sacrifice had just been offered, would meet him. They would be plunged in prophetic raptures, he would hear them chanting hymns to the Eternal, accompanied by the music of their instruments. A new and mighty influence, Samuel told the astonished Saul, would, as he met this company of singers, come upon him, and involuntarily he who evidently had never joined before in any of these solemn choruses would sing his part with the rest. The new influence, said the old seer, which would then come upon him would be the Spirit of the Lord, and from that moment he would be a changed man. Never in his after days of glory and might was the king to forget how, in a moment, the Divine power had swept down and given him--the ignorant shepherd, the humble vine-dresser, the heir to a few asses and sheep, to some fields of corn or vineyards--wisdom, power, and a mighty kingdom. He must remember that in a moment the same Divine power might wing away from him its solemn flight; that was the lesson of the third sign which was to meet him on his homeward journey.<p>The LXX. and Vulg. have a somewhat long addition to <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>. It is, however, manifestly an explanatory gloss, and is made up from <a href="/context/1_samuel/10-16.htm" title="And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.">1Samuel 10:16-17</a> of 1 Samuel 9.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre.</span>--This tomb of the loved wife of the patriarch does not thus appear to have been very far from Ramah, whence Saul started. The words of <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, which speak of the future massacre of the Bethlehem innocents by Herod, connects Ramah and Rachel's tomb: "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation <span class= "ital">and </span>bitter weeping: Rachel weeping for her children."<p><span class= "bld">At Zelzah.</span>--This locality has never been identified. Some have supposed it was the same as Zela in Benjamin. the place where the bodies of Saul and Jonathan were eventually buried. The LXX. curiously render it as though it were a verb, "dancing (lit. springing) vehemently," or, as Ewald would translate the Greek words, "in great haste," of course, with reference to the two men who brought Saul the news of the recovered asses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The first sign - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre.</span> In <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> (quoted in <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>) Rachel's sepulchre is connected with Ramah, but in <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a> it is placed near Bethlehem. The whole of the geography of Saul's wanderings is very obscure, but Wilson ('Lands of the Bible,' 1:401) places <span class="cmt_word">Zelzah</span> at Beit-jala, to the west of Bethlehem, in the neighbourhood of the Kabhet Rahil, or Tomb of Rachel, Though both are now in the tribe of Judah, yet by a slight rectification of the frontier, in conformity with <a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-28</a>, Zelzah would be on the border of Benjamin, and there may have been local reasons for Saul and his companion not taking the most direct route for Gibeah. The news given by these men, that the asses were found, would set Saul's mind at rest, and, freed from lower cares, he would be able to give his thoughts entirely to preparation for the higher duties that were before him.
