This service was a fulfillment of Hannah's vow to dedicate her son to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11, 28</a>). Samuel's role as a minister to the Lord signifies his early dedication and the beginning of his prophetic ministry. The phrase "before Eli" indicates that Samuel was under Eli's mentorship and authority, learning the duties of priesthood and service to God. This setting in Shiloh, a central place of worship before the establishment of the temple in Jerusalem, highlights the importance of Samuel's role in Israel's spiritual life.<p><b>Now in those days the word of the LORD was rare,</b><br>During this period, Israel was experiencing a spiritual decline, marked by the scarcity of divine revelation. The rarity of God's word suggests a time of moral and spiritual darkness, where prophetic messages were infrequent. This scarcity can be attributed to the corruption of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were priests but acted wickedly (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). The lack of prophetic guidance left the nation without clear direction from God, emphasizing the need for a faithful prophet like Samuel.<p><b>and visions were scarce.</b><br>Visions, as a means of divine communication, were uncommon during this time, further illustrating the spiritual barrenness of Israel. In the Old Testament, visions were often used by God to reveal His will and guidance to His people (e.g., <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>). The scarcity of visions indicates a period where God was not actively revealing Himself to His people, possibly due to their disobedience and the corruption of the priesthood. This context sets the stage for Samuel's significant role as a prophet who would restore the communication between God and Israel, ultimately leading to the anointing of kings and the establishment of a united monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, serving in the temple under the priest Eli.

God&#8217;s purposes march on, ensuring that even in the darkest times His voice will be heard and His plan fulfilled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The child Samuel ministered unto the Lord.</span>--The writer of this history, although well aware of the great revolution accomplished in Israel by the prophet whose life and work the Holy Spirit bade him record, gives us but the simplest and shortest possible account of the child-days of him who was only second to Moses in his influence on the eventful story of the chosen people. But short and devoid of detail though the record be, it is enough to show us that the atmosphere in which the child lived was a pure and holy one; the boy was evidently kept apart from Hophni, Phinehas, and their impious self-seeking party. The high priestly guardian was evidently fully conscious of the importance of his charge, and he watched over his pupil with a tender watchful care. Perhaps his sad experiences with his evil headstrong sons had taught the old man wisdom; certainly the training he gave to Samuel was one that educated the boy well for his after-life of stirring public work. The notices of the childhood and boyhood are indeed brief. The first contrasts sharply the lawless profligacy of the priestly houses with the pure holy childhood passed in the sanctuary courts, probably always in the company of the old man. Hophni and Phinehas, <span class= "ital">the grown men </span>prostituted the holy work to their own vile worldly ends: <span class= "ital">the child </span>ministered before the Lord in his little white robe; and while in the home life of his own mother and father in Ramah, his brothers and sisters were growing up with the sorrows and joys of other Hebrew children, "the child Samuel grew before the Lord" amid the stillness and silence and the awful mystery of the Divine protection, which seems ever, even in the darkest days of the history of Israel, to have surrounded the home of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. It was amidst this silent, sacred mystery, apart from the disorders of his priestly sons, that Eli taught the boy the story of his ancestors, with only the dark curtains of the sanctuary hanging between master and pupil and the mystic golden throne of God, on which His glory was sometimes pleased to rest.<p>The writer wrote his gloomy recital of the wild unbridled life of the wicked priests, wrote down the weak, sorrowful remonstrances of the father and high priest, foreshadowing, however, their certain doom; and then, again, with their life of shame sharply contrasts the pure child-life of the little pupil of the old sorrow-stricken high priest--the boy whom all men loved. "And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men."<p>Once more Eli, now weak with age, is warned of the sure consequences which would follow the evil licence and the irreligion of his priestly sons; and again the boy Samuel and his life, guided by Eli, his guardian and teacher, is contrasted with the wild, unchecked lawlessness of the priestly sons of Eli perpetually dishonouring religion and the sanctuary--a lawlessness which had just been denounced by the nameless prophet (<a href="/context/1_samuel/2-27.htm" title="And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?">1Samuel 2:27-36</a>).<p>Josephus tells us that Samuel, when the Lord first called him, was twelve years old. This was the age of the child Jesus when He disputed with the doctors in the Temple.<p><span class= "bld">Was precious in those days</span>.--Precious, that is, <span class= "ital">rare. </span>"The word of the Lord" is the will of the Lord announced by a prophet, seer, or man of God. Between the days of Deborah and the nameless man of God who came with the awful message to Eli, no inspired voice seems to have spoken to the chosen people.<p>The "open vision<span class= "ital">" </span>refers to such manifestations of the Divinity as were vouchsafed to Abraham, Moses, Joshua, and Manoah, and in this chapter to Samuel. There may possibly be some reference to the appearance of Divine glory which was connected with the Urim and Thummim which were worn by the high priest. This significant silence on the part of the invisible King the writer dwells on as a result of the deep corruption into which the priests and, through their evil example, a large proportion of the nation, had fallen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord was precious in those days</span>. Or rather <span class="accented">rare</span>; it came but seldom, and there was no proper order of persons from whose ranks the "speakers for God" would naturally step forth. It was this which made the revelation of Jehovah's will to Samuel an event so memorable both for the Jewish nation and for the Church; for he was called by the providence of God to be the founder of prophecy as an established institution, and henceforward, side by side with the king and priest, the prophet took his place as one of the three factors in the preparation for the coming of him who is a king to rule, a Priest to make atonement, and also a Prophet to teach his people and guide them into all the truth. <span class="cmt_word">There was no open vision.</span> Literally, "no vision that broke forth" (see <a href="/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>, where it is used of the publication of a decree). The meaning is, that though prophecy was an essential condition of the spiritual life of Israel, yet that hitherto it had not been promulgated and established as a fact. The gift had not absolutely been withheld, but neither had it been permanently granted as a settled ordinance. There are in Hebrew two words for <span class="cmt_word">vision</span>: the one used here, <span class="accented">hazon</span>, refers to such sights as are revealed to the tranced eye of the seer when in a state of ecstasy; while the other, <span class="accented">march</span>, is a vision seen by the natural eye.
