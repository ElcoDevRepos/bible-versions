After fleeing from King Saul, David and his men found themselves in the wilderness of Paran, a desolate area that provided both challenges and protection. This wilderness experience is reminiscent of other biblical figures, such as Moses and the Israelites, who also spent significant time in the wilderness. It was a place of testing and reliance on God, shaping David's character and leadership. The wilderness symbolizes a place of spiritual growth and dependence on God's provision.<p><b>he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep</b><br>Sheep shearing was a significant event in ancient Israel, marking a time of festivity and abundance. It was customary for landowners to celebrate the shearing season with feasts, as it was a time of economic gain. Nabal, whose name means "fool," was a wealthy man from Maon, and his sheep-shearing event would have been a large and notable occasion. This context sets the stage for the interaction between David and Nabal, highlighting the cultural expectations of hospitality and generosity during such times. The mention of sheep shearing connects to other biblical narratives where sheep and shepherding play crucial roles, such as in the life of Jacob and the parable of the Good Shepherd, pointing to themes of provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and at this time, a fugitive from King Saul.

It anchors David in God-directed wilderness training, shows his vigilant leadership, and foreshadows a clash between covenant generosity and hard-hearted folly. The scene prepares us to witness God&#8217;s justice for Nabal, protection for David, and grace toward Abigail, underscoring that even routine news&#8212;&#8220;Nabal was shearing sheep&#8221;&#8212;fits into the Lord&#8217;s precise, purposeful care for His anointed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And David heard in the wilderness.</span>--The question of the support of the large band of devoted followers who obeyed David must have been usually a very anxious one. No doubt, contributions from the farmers and sheep-masters materially aided the supplies David and his men derived from their raids across the Philistine borders. It is likely enough that some of these contributions were not always willingly made; still, there is no doubt that the presence of the armed band of David during the latter years of Saul afforded considerable protection to the border land. His position resembled that of a modern Arab sheik of a friendly Bedaween tribe, and it is clear that on the whole his career as head of an army of free lances tended to popularise him among the southern tribes of Israel. Nabal's conduct appears to have been more than churlish and foolish, for David, according to the showing of Nabal's own shepherds, had on many occasions been of substantial service to them as they tended their flocks in exposed and dangerous localities. The testimony of these shepherd folk may be accepted generally as the popular estimate of David and his acts during this rough and sorely tried period of his life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - Though David had gone some distance southward of Carmel, yet it was worth his while to send men to Nabal's sheep shearing, as the maintenance of his numerous force must have been a continual difficulty. The large number, <span class="cmt_word">ten</span>, also shows that he expected a liberal gift of food. Probably such missions were not uncommon, and the large sheep masters were glad to supply the wants of one who guarded their flocks and defended them from the incursions of the desert tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was in the wilderness,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
