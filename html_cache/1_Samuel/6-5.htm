The Philistines, who had captured the Ark of the Covenant, were suffering from a plague that included tumors and an infestation of rats. This directive to make images reflects their attempt to acknowledge the power of the God of Israel and seek relief. The use of images in this context contrasts with the Israelite prohibition against idolatry, highlighting the Philistines' pagan practices. The mention of rats suggests a connection to the bubonic plague, as rats are known carriers of the disease.<p><b>Give glory to the God of Israel,</b><br>The Philistines are instructed to honor the God of Israel, recognizing His supremacy and power. This acknowledgment is significant as it comes from a pagan nation that had previously defeated Israel in battle. Giving glory to God involves recognizing His authority and submitting to His will, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This act of giving glory is a form of repentance and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, similar to how Nebuchadnezzar eventually glorifies God in <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>.<p><b>and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land.</b><br>The phrase "lift His hand" refers to the removal of divine judgment or punishment. The Philistines hope that by honoring God, He will cease the afflictions plaguing them. This reflects a common biblical theme where repentance and acknowledgment of God lead to mercy and relief from judgment, as seen in the story of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>. The mention of "your gods" indicates that the Philistines' deities were also affected, underscoring the impotence of their idols compared to the God of Israel. The land's suffering highlights the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, affecting both people and the environment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who captured the Ark of the Covenant and experienced plagues as a result.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest representing God's presence, captured by the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>The one true God, whose power and glory are acknowledged even by the Philistines.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tumors_and_rats.htm">Tumors and Rats</a></b><br>Physical afflictions sent by God as a judgment upon the Philistines for taking the Ark.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_the_philistines.htm">Land of the Philistines</a></b><br>The region suffering from the plagues due to the presence of the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledging God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The Philistines' decision to give glory to the God of Israel highlights the importance of recognizing God's supreme authority in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>The act of making images of tumors and rats symbolizes an attempt at repentance.

Here, gold&#8212;symbol of costliness&#8212;confesses guilt and places value on God&#8217;s mercy.<p>&#8226; The act is literal: real golden tumors are to be crafted. No room is left for mere symbolism; the text shows concrete obedience to divine instruction.<p>&#8226; By shaping the very image of shame, the Philistines humble themselves before the God they had previously insulted by seizing His ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of the rats that are ravaging the land</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and of the rats that are ravaging the land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Just as tumors struck bodies, rats devastated fields, underscoring that God can touch both personal health and national livelihood (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-42</a>).<p>&#8226; Five golden rats match the five golden tumors (<a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17-18</a>), linking the dual calamity to all five Philistine rulers.<p>&#8226; By portraying the rodents in gold, the Philistines admit that even what seems insignificant&#8212;rats&#8212;moves under God&#8217;s command (<a href="/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing of human suffering and agricultural loss reflects the breadth of divine judgment; nothing lies outside His reach (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give glory to the God of Israel</b><p>&#8220;Give glory to the God of Israel&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase recalls Joshua&#8217;s demand of Achan: &#8220;My son, give glory to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>). Confession of sin honors God&#8217;s holiness.<p>&#8226; Glory is not transferred; it is acknowledged. The Philistines concede that Israel&#8217;s God alone caused the plague, dismissing any supposed power of Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly equates giving glory with repentance and worship (<a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-2</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>). The Philistines, though pagans, must respond in the same way every nation must: surrender to truth.<p>&#8226; This call foreshadows universal recognition of God&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hand&#8221; signals active, personal involvement; God&#8217;s hand was &#8220;heavy&#8221; on the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>). Relief hinges on humble obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Philistine idols are powerless to defend themselves. God&#8217;s judgment exposes their impotence (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;perhaps&#8221; does not question God&#8217;s mercy but underscores human uncertainty; forgiveness is God&#8217;s sovereign choice (<a href="/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Land, gods, and people alike are under the same authority. Removing the plague would display His compassion while affirming His dominion (<a href="/exodus/9-29.htm">Exodus 9:29</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-15.htm">1 Samuel 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The Philistine chiefs, suffering under God&#8217;s heavy hand, are instructed to craft golden replicas of their tumors and the rats destroying their crops. By doing so, they publicly confess that Israel&#8217;s God alone inflicted&#8212;and can remove&#8212;their judgment. The command calls them to honor His glory, repent of their defiance, and seek mercy. The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereign power over body, field, and false deity, and it foreshadows a universal truth: every nation must ultimately acknowledge and glorify the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Images of your mice.</span>--This is the first mention of the plague of "mice" in the Hebrew text. The Greek Version had (see above) carefully appended to the description of the bodily disease the account of this scourge which devastated the land of Philistia. In these warm countries which border the Mediterranean vast quantities of these mice from time to time seem to have appeared and devoured the crops. Aristotle and Pliny both mention their devastations. In Egypt this visitation was so dreaded that the mouse seems to have been the hieroglyphic for destruction. The curse then weighed heavily in Philistia, both upon man and the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mice that mar the land.</span> The idea of a plague of field mice is, as we have seen, due to one of those many unauthorised insertions of the Septuagint by which they supposed that they removed difficulties from the way of their readers. As the ancients use the names of animals in a very generic way, any rodent may be meant from the jerboa downwards; but probably it was the common field mouse, <span class="accented">arvicola arvensis</span>, still common in Syria, which multiplies with great rapidity, and is very destructive to the crops, and so became the symbol of devastation and pestilence (see on ch. 5:6). When, as Herodotus relates (Book 2:141), the Assyrian army of Sennacherib had been defeated, because a vast multitude of field mice had overrun his camp and gnawed asunder the bow strings of his troops, the Egyptians raised a statue to Hephaestus, holding in his hand a mouse. But very probably this is but the literal explanation by Herodotus of what he saw, while to a well instructed Egyptian it represented their god of healing, holding in his hand the mouse, as the symbol either of the devastation which he had averted, or of the pestilence with which he had smitten the Assyrian army (see on 1 Samuel 5:6). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
