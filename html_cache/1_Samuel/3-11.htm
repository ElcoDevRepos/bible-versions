Samuel, a young boy serving under Eli the priest, is being called to be a prophet. This calling is reminiscent of other biblical figures who were called by God at a young age, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>). The LORD speaking directly to Samuel signifies a shift in divine communication, as God had not been speaking frequently during this period (<a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>).<p><b>I am about to do something in Israel</b><br>God is preparing to enact judgment and change within the nation of Israel. This statement foreshadows the coming events that will impact the entire nation, particularly the downfall of Eli's house due to the sins of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17, 27</a>-36). The phrase indicates God's active role in the history of Israel, emphasizing His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His divine plans.<p><b>at which the ears of all who hear it will tingle</b><br>This expression is used in the Bible to describe an event that is shocking and awe-inspiring, often associated with judgment (<a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>). The tingling of ears suggests a reaction of fear and astonishment, indicating the severity and impact of God's forthcoming actions. This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's message and the profound effect it will have on the people of Israel. It serves as a warning and a call to attention, highlighting the importance of listening to and heeding God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and plans to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under Eli, who is called by God to be a prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, under whose guidance Samuel is serving.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often straying from His commandments, yet central to His redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The place where Samuel serves, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and His plans will come to pass, often involving judgment on sin.<br><br>Reflect on the seriousness of God's judgment and the call to live righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>Samuel's attentiveness to God's voice is a model for believers.<br><br>Cultivate a heart that is open and responsive to God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Eli's household faced severe consequences due to unrepentant sin.<br><br>Recognize the impact of sin and the importance of repentance and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_use_of_the_humble_and_young.htm">God's Use of the Humble and Young</a></b><br>God chose young Samuel to deliver His message, showing that He can use anyone willing to listen.<br><br>Encourage young believers to be open to God's calling and to serve faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_3_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_3_11_God_s_message_to_servants.htm">How does 1 Samuel 3:11 demonstrate God's communication with His chosen servants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_judgment_in_1_Samuel_3_11.htm">What does God's message in 1 Samuel 3:11 reveal about His judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_hear_God_s_voice_like_Samuel_2.htm">How can we discern God's voice today, as Samuel did in 1 Samuel 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_3_11_NT_justice_links.htm">What scriptural connections exist between 1 Samuel 3:11 and God's justice in the New Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Responding_to_God_s_tough_truths.htm">How should we respond when God reveals difficult truths, as in 1 Samuel 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_3_11_on_God_s_communication.htm">What does 1 Samuel 3:11 reveal about God's communication with humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_3_11_and_divine_justice.htm">How does 1 Samuel 3:11 challenge our understanding of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_reveal_plans_to_Samuel_in_1_Sam_3_11.htm">Why did God choose to reveal His plans to Samuel in 1 Samuel 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_rhetorical_criticism.htm">Who was Uriah the Hittite in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_samuel_lead_and_anoint_kings.htm">How did Samuel lead Israel and anoint its first kings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/compare_samuel's_leadership_with_ot_priestly_roles..htm">How does Samuel&#8217;s leadership in 1 Samuel 7 compare with conflicting narratives about priestly authority in other Old Testament books?
