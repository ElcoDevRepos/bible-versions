The ongoing nature of the discussion suggests the fear and anxiety present in the camp due to Goliath's challenge. The soldiers' focus on the reward rather than the battle itself highlights their reluctance to face the giant.<p><b>Do you see how this man keeps coming out to defy Israel?</b><br>Goliath's repeated defiance is a direct challenge not only to the Israelite army but also to their God. In ancient warfare, battles often represented the power of the gods of the respective nations. Goliath's taunts were an affront to the God of Israel, making this a spiritual as well as a physical confrontation. This echoes the earlier narrative of the Philistines capturing the Ark of the Covenant, where the power of God was similarly challenged.<p><b>To the man who kills him the king will give great riches.</b><br>The promise of great riches reflects the high stakes of the battle and the desperation of King Saul. In the ancient Near East, wealth was a sign of God's favor and a means of securing one's future. Saul's offer indicates the significant threat Goliath posed and the king's willingness to incentivize someone to face him.<p><b>And he will give him his daughter in marriage</b><br>Offering a daughter in marriage was a common practice to secure alliances and reward bravery. This promise would elevate the victor's social status, integrating him into the royal family. It also reflects the cultural importance of marriage as a means of political and social advancement.<p><b>and exempt his father&#8217;s house from taxation in Israel.</b><br>Tax exemption was a significant incentive, as it relieved the victor's family from financial burdens and obligations to the state. This offer underscores the king's desperation to find a champion willing to face Goliath. It also highlights the socio-economic structure of ancient Israel, where taxation was a common practice to support the monarchy and military endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are facing the Philistine threat and are intimidated by Goliath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>The Philistine giant who defies the armies of Israel, representing a significant threat and challenge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_saul.htm">King Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who offers rewards to anyone who can defeat Goliath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel, who are in conflict with them during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, he is the young shepherd who eventually accepts the challenge to fight Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_intimidation.htm">Courage in the Face of Intimidation</a></b><br>The Israelites were intimidated by Goliath's size and strength.

Their repeated words expose Israel&#8217;s fear and Saul&#8217;s desperation, yet they also provide the backdrop for David&#8217;s God-centered courage. Where people focus on rewards and threats, David will focus on the honor of the Lord, proving that faith in the living God outshines every earthly promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And make his father's house free in Israel.</span>--Among the lavish offers Saul made to the one who should vanquish the giant was this, "The family of the successful combatant should be free in Israel." The exact signification here of the Hebrew word rendered "free" is disputed. The simple meaning would seem to be freedom from personal service in the army and elsewhere, what in mediaeval history is known by the general term <span class= "ital">Corvee. </span>It also probably includes a certain exemption from taxation or enforced contributions to war expenses.<p>Ewald goes still further, and considers that the royal. promise included the elevation of the house of the victorious warrior to noble rank, as henceforth they would be "free"--"freeholders," a family released from the ordinary service of subjects; and this high distinction, the great German scholar considers, would easily come to be looked upon as hereditary, and thus such favoured houses would form an intermediate stage between the king and the simple subject. Although it is clear that a wonderful advance in the internal development of the kingdom of the children of Israel had taken place in Saul's reign, yet it is doubtful if the government of the first king was as yet sufficiently organised to justify us in accepting, in its fulness, the conclusion of the ingenious comment of Ewald here. It does not appear from the narrative that these promises were ever fulfilled by Saul in the case of the house of Jesse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To defy Israel.</span> Rather, "to cast scorn on," "to dishonour Israel" (see on ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">The king will enrich him with great riches,... and make his father's house free in Israel.</span> Many years must have elapsed before Saul could thus have developed the powers of the crown, and the last words show that contributions were levied from all the households in Israel for the support of the king and his retinue. There had manifestly been a great advance since the day when Jesse sent the king a few loaves of bread, a skin of wine, and a kid (<a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). Still we cannot imagine that Saul had introduced taxes, nor was the political organisation of the State ripe enough for so advanced a state of things. The words more probably refer to freedom from personal service in the army and elsewhere; though it is quite possible that on special occasions contributions may have been levied, and presents, no doubt, were constantly being made to the king, though on no regular system. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh away the reproach.</span> The noun formed from the verb rendered <span class="accented">defy in</span> ver. 10, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>.
