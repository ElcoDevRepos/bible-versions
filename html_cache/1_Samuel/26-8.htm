His presence with David in this moment highlights the close-knit group of warriors who surrounded David during his time of fleeing from Saul. Abishai's loyalty is significant, as it reflects the strong bonds and trust within David's inner circle, which were crucial for his survival and eventual kingship.<p><b>Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand</b><br>This phrase reflects a common belief in divine providence, where events are seen as orchestrated by God. Abishai interprets the situation as a divinely appointed opportunity for David to eliminate Saul, who has been pursuing him relentlessly. This belief in God's sovereignty over human affairs is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where victories and defeats are often attributed to God's will.<p><b>Now, therefore, please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke</b><br>Abishai's request to kill Saul with a single stroke of the spear demonstrates his confidence and skill as a warrior. The spear, a common weapon in ancient warfare, symbolizes both the means of deliverance and the potential for violence. This moment is a test of David's character and his commitment to God's anointed king, Saul, despite Saul's pursuit of him.<p><b>I will not need to strike him twice!</b><br>Abishai's assurance that he can kill Saul with one blow underscores his prowess and determination. It also highlights the temptation for David to take matters into his own hands and secure his kingship through violence. However, David's refusal to harm Saul, despite the opportunity, reflects his respect for God's anointed and his trust in God's timing for his own rise to power. This restraint is a foreshadowing of the New Testament teaching of loving one's enemies and leaving vengeance to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is being pursued by King Saul.

Still, his plan violates the sanctity of God&#8217;s chosen king (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Using Saul&#8217;s own spear would turn the weapon of pursuit into the instrument of death&#8212;poetic justice in Abishai&#8217;s eyes.<p>&#8226; The request highlights a tension between human justice and divine timing; Abishai wants closure, but David knows vengeance belongs to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Quick, decisive action appeals to the flesh, yet God often refines His servants through prolonged patience (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not need to strike him twice!</b><p>&#8226; Abishai&#8217;s confidence in a single fatal blow underscores his warrior skill (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/23-18.htm">2 Samuel 23:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; The line also implies mercy&#8212;no drawn-out suffering. Ironically, such &#8220;mercy&#8221; would still be direct disobedience.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s refusal (<a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>) shows true spiritual maturity: he values obedience over efficiency.<p>&#8226; The episode illustrates that righteous ends never justify unrighteous means (<a href="/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abishai&#8217;s plea in <a href="/1_samuel/26-8.htm">1 Samuel 26:8</a> captures the allure of instant justice: the opportunity appears God-given, the method seems efficient, and the result would remove a dangerous enemy. Yet the verse&#8217;s larger purpose is to contrast Abishai&#8217;s impulsive zeal with David&#8217;s faith-filled restraint. While Abishai measures success by a single stroke, David measures obedience by unwavering respect for God&#8217;s anointed and trust in God&#8217;s timing. The passage teaches that true faith waits, even when circumstances suggest we could hasten God&#8217;s plan by our own hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I will not smite him the second time.</span>--The meaning of <span class= "ital">the </span>savage words of Abishai is accurately given in Lange's paraphrase, "I will pin him to the ground so thoroughly with one blow that it will not need another to kul him;" "<span class= "ital">et secundo non opus erit" </span>as the Vulg. well renders it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Abishai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#353;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_52.htm">Strong's 52: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abishai -- 'my father is Jesse', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
