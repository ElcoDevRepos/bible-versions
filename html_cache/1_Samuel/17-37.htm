In the ancient Near East, shepherds often faced dangerous predators, and David's victories over a lion and a bear demonstrate his courage and reliance on God. This phrase highlights the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and protection, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd. David's trust in God foreshadows the deliverance and salvation themes found throughout the Bible.<p><b>will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221;</b><br>David's faith is not just based on past experiences but also on his understanding of God's covenant with Israel. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel, and Goliath represented a challenge not just to the army but to the God of Israel. David's declaration is an expression of his belief that God will continue to protect and deliver His people, as He has done in the past. This confidence in divine intervention is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;Go,&#8221; said Saul,</b><br>King Saul's response to David is significant. Despite his initial skepticism, Saul allows David to face Goliath, indicating a moment of trust in David's faith and courage. Saul's leadership is often contrasted with David's in the biblical narrative, highlighting Saul's reliance on human strength and David's reliance on God. This moment marks a turning point where Saul, albeit briefly, acknowledges the possibility of divine intervention through David.<p><b>&#8220;and may the LORD be with you.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's blessing, "may the LORD be with you," is a common biblical expression of hope for divine presence and favor. It reflects the understanding that success and victory come from God's presence and support. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's presence with His chosen leaders, as seen with Moses, Joshua, and later with Jesus Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). Saul's words, though perhaps spoken with uncertainty, align with the biblical truth that God's presence is essential for overcoming challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel.

It was a great act of courageous trust in the Glorious Arm which had, Saul knew, so often fought for Israel. We must bear in mind that it was no mere duel between two fighting men, an Israelite and a Philistine, but that the fortunes of the nation for an indefinite period were to be staked on this momentous single combat between a tried warrior of gigantic strength and a boy quite unaccustomed to martial exercises, and, as we shall presently see, a stranger even to a soldier's dress and martial equipment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul said unto David, Go.</span> The king's consent was necessary before David could act as the champion of the Israelites. It was a courageous act in Saul to give his permission, considering the conditions of the combat (see ver. 9), but the two arguments here given persuaded him: the first, David's strong confidence in Jehovah, insuring his courage; and, secondly, the coolness and bravery he had shown in these dangerous encounters with savage animals. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">added,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
