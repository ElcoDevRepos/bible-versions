The Kenites were a nomadic tribe with historical ties to the Israelites. Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, was a Kenite, which established a friendly relationship between the two groups. This warning reflects the importance of honoring alliances and past kindnesses, a principle seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt</b><br>The Kenites' kindness refers to their support and guidance during Israel's exodus from Egypt. This act of kindness is recorded in <a href="/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a>, where Jethro advises Moses on leadership. The Kenites' positive relationship with Israel is a testament to the enduring impact of hospitality and support, which is a recurring theme in biblical narratives.<p><b>go on and get away from the Amalekites</b><br>The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>.

The Kenites are advised to separate themselves to avoid sharing in the Amalekites' fate, illustrating the biblical principle of separating from those under God's judgment.<p><b>Otherwise I will sweep you away with them</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's command to Saul and the impending judgment on the Amalekites. It highlights the concept of collective judgment, where proximity to sin or sinners can lead to shared consequences, a theme also seen in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites</b><br>The Kenites' obedience to Saul's warning demonstrates wisdom and discernment. Their action reflects the biblical principle of heeding divine warnings and separating from evil influences.

His first move is not military might but a clear word of warning. By doing so, Saul reflects God&#8217;s consistent pattern of distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>). The Lord&#8217;s justice is never reckless; it is precise and personal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt,&#8221;</b><p>This clause reaches back centuries to the Exodus era. The Kenites, through Moses&#8217; father-in-law Jethro, aided Israel (<a href="/exodus/18-9.htm">Exodus 18:9-12</a>). Later, they traveled with the tribe of Judah into Canaan (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>) and even cooperated with Deborah and Barak (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>). God remembers acts of kindness (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>) and honors His promise that those who bless His people will themselves be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;go on and get away from the Amalekites.&#8221;</b><p>Separation is urgent because judgment on Amalek is imminent (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a>).<p>Helpful parallels:<p>&#8226; Lot was urged to leave Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-12.htm">Genesis 19:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God calls His people, &#8220;Come out of her, My people&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>).<p>Obedience to a call of separation often means life instead of destruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.&#8221;</b><p>Divine judgment can fall collectively (<a href="/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26-33</a>), so proximity to evil is perilous. The warning reinforces personal responsibility: the Kenites must act. Grace offers a way of escape (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>), but it must be taken. God&#8217;s mercy and justice operate together; mercy provides the exit, justice proceeds on schedule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</b><p>They heed the warning immediately, illustrating:<p>&#8226; Quick obedience (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>&#8226; The blessing of responding to God&#8217;s Word before the sword falls (<a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>).<p>Their relocation spares them and preserves a remnant friendly to Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). The narrative quietly affirms that past kindness toward God&#8217;s people is never wasted; it returns in protection and favor (<a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a> shows God&#8217;s meticulous justice and faithful remembrance.

The passage underscores a timeless lesson: God honors those who honor His people, warns before He judges, and provides a clear path of escape to all who will listen and act.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And Saul said unto the Kenites.</span>--The Kenites, like the Amalekites, were a nomad race of Arabs, but seem to have been ever friendly to the Israelites. This kindly feeling sprang up soon after the departure from Egypt, and was, no doubt, in the first instance owing to the fact of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, belonging to this people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul said unto the Kenites.</span> Not while he was lying in ambush in the torrent bed, but after smiting Ir-Amalek. The Kenites were always friendly to the Israelites, but seem, like the Amalekites, to have been a Bedouin nation, ever wandering about without a settled home. In Abraham's time they were a powerful people (<a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>), but, for some reason or other, broke up into small tribes, some, as those here spoken of, choosing the wilderness of Judah for their home (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), others living far to the north in Naphtali (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11, 17</a>), others among the rocks of Arabia Petraea. Of these last we know but little, but the rest continued to be on friendly terms with David (<a href="/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">warned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
