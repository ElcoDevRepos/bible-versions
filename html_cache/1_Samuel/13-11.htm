In the biblical context, Samuel is the prophet and judge of Israel, serving as God's mouthpiece. His question implies a breach of divine command. This echoes God's question to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>, highlighting a moment of accountability. Samuel's role as a prophet is to guide and correct, and this question sets the stage for Saul's failure to adhere to God's instructions.<p><b>And Saul replied, &#8220;When I saw that the troops were deserting me,</b><br>Saul's response reveals his fear and insecurity as a leader. The desertion of troops indicates a lack of confidence in Saul's leadership, which is a recurring theme in his reign. This situation reflects the Israelites' earlier demand for a king to lead them like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), showing the human tendency to rely on visible leadership rather than divine guidance. Saul's focus on the troops' actions rather than God's command reveals his misplaced priorities.<p><b>and that you did not come at the appointed time</b><br>Saul's accusation against Samuel suggests impatience and a lack of faith. The "appointed time" refers to the seven days Samuel instructed Saul to wait (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>). Saul's impatience leads him to take matters into his own hands, a common human failing when divine timing seems delayed. This impatience contrasts with the patience and obedience exemplified by figures like Abraham, who waited for God's promise (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>).<p><b>and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,</b><br>Michmash is a strategic location in the central highlands of Israel, significant in military campaigns. The Philistines, Israel's persistent adversaries, are gathering here, creating a sense of urgency and threat. Historically, the Philistines were a technologically advanced people, known for their iron weaponry, which posed a significant threat to Israel. This gathering at Michmash sets the stage for the ensuing conflict and highlights the constant pressure Israel faced from surrounding nations. Saul's focus on the Philistine threat rather than seeking God's guidance foreshadows his eventual downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

It is not a request for information&#8212;God and His prophet already know&#8212;but an invitation for Saul to own his failure. Like Joshua&#8217;s words to Achan in <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, it presses the sinner toward confession. The confrontation exposes that:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Authority comes from God, not circumstance; when God speaks, disobedience is sin whether it &#8220;works&#8221; or not (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Leaders are accountable; &#8220;to whom much is given, much will be required&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Excuses follow sin; Saul immediately shifts blame, just as Adam and Eve did (<a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When I saw that the troops were deserting me</b><p>Fear of losing men eclipsed fear of God. Saul walks by sight, the opposite of the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-3</a>: &#8220;Do not be afraid when you see horses and chariots&#8230; for the LORD your God is with you&#8221;. Contrast:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Gideon&#8217;s army shrank from 32,000 to 300, yet &#8220;the LORD delivered Midian&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Jonathan later says, &#8220;Nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>By fixing on departing soldiers instead of the LORD of hosts, Saul trades divine sufficiency for human statistics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that you did not come at the appointed time</b><p>Impatience now blames the prophet. Yet Samuel had already set clear terms: &#8220;Wait seven days&#8230; then I will come&#8230; and show you what you should do&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>). Waiting tests faith:<p>&#8226;&#8195;<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> urges, &#8220;Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong&#8230; and wait.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8195;<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> assures, &#8220;Though it lingers, wait for it; it will surely come.&#8221;<p>God&#8217;s timetable refines His servants. Saul&#8217;s clock ruled him, so he seized priestly duties (<a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>), violating <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a> which reserves that service for Aaron&#8217;s line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash</b><p>The threat was real&#8212;&#8220;The Philistines assembled&#8230; thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>). Yet God had already promised victory over these same Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows crises meant to showcase divine power, not human ingenuity:<p>&#8226;&#8195;At the Red Sea, Israel faced an army and no escape; &#8220;The LORD will fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Jehoshaphat heard of a vast coalition at En Gedi and prayed, &#8220;We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>).<p>Saul, eyes on the enemy, forgot the covenant LORD who had sworn to defend Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a> exposes a heart ruled by fear, impatience, and sight. Saul&#8217;s downward spiral begins with ignoring a clear command, grows through blaming others, and culminates in taking forbidden action. Scripture consistently calls God&#8217;s people to trust His timing, heed His word, and see threats as opportunities for His glory. Wait on Him, obey first, and let the size of the enemy only magnify the faithfulness of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">What hast thou done?</span>--The deeper aspects of King Saul's sin are discussed in <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>F. On this memorable occasion the king plainly told Samuel that though he would gratefully receive any help which the prophet of the Most High could and would bring him, still, in an emergency like the present, sooner than run any risk, he preferred to act alone, and, if necessary, to go into battle without Divine consecration and blessing. The danger at this juncture was imminent; to ward it off, he considered that the direct Divine intimation which he allowed he had received through Samuel must be disregarded. Acting upon this persuasion, he set it aside, acting according to the ordinary dictates of worldly prudence. He must in his action at Gilgal either have forgotten or disbelieved the story of the Joshua conquest, and of the signal deliverances under the hero Judges, when the Glorious Arm fought by the people, and splendid successes were won in the face of enormous odds through the intervention of no mortal aid.<p>Saul might have been, and was, a valiant and skilful general, but was no fitting Viceroy of the invisible King in heaven, who required from him before all things the most ardent unquestioning faith.<p>Saul and his house, it is too clear, would only rule the Israel of God according to the dictates of their own haughty will.<p>The twice-repeated assertion of Samuel, "Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord" (<a href="/context/1_samuel/13-13.htm" title="And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom on Israel for ever.">1Samuel 13:13-14</a>)--an assertion uncontradicted by Saul--shows us that this whole transaction was an act of overt rebellion against the will of the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hast thou done?</span> The question implies rebuke, which Saul answers by pleading his danger. Each day's delay made his small force dwindle rapidly away, and the Philistines might at any hour move down from Michmash upon him at Gilgal and destroy him. But it was the reality of the danger which put his faith and obedience to the trial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(meh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have you done?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
