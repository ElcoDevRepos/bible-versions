The Amalekites first attacked the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), and God commanded their destruction as a consequence. The city of Amalek likely refers to a central location or stronghold of the Amalekite people, though its exact location is not known today. This campaign was a direct command from God through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15:1-3</a>), emphasizing the importance of obedience to divine instructions.<p><b>and lay in wait in the valley.</b><br>The strategy of laying in wait suggests a tactical approach to warfare, possibly to surprise the Amalekites or to prepare for a strategic advantage. Valleys in ancient warfare often served as places for ambushes or as staging grounds for battle. This tactic reflects the military practices of the time, where terrain played a crucial role in the success of military operations. The valley could symbolize a place of decision and judgment, aligning with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s judgment against the Amalekites for their past transgressions against Israel. Saul's actions here set the stage for the subsequent events where his failure to fully obey God's command leads to his rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-10.htm">1 Samuel 15:10-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This echoes earlier victories granted when Israel acted promptly (<a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; His coming also highlights the unfolding judgment God promised centuries earlier after Amalek&#8217;s unprovoked assault on Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17&#8211;19</a>).

Rashi explains the verb as signifying "contended with himself," and quotes from the Talmud an opinion that when Saul reached the torrent he called to mind the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>, to slay a heifer at a torrent in expiation of a murder, and had misgivings whether a slaughter so indiscriminate as that on which he was engaged could be justified. The law of the Herem was soon softened down, but we find David in several of his wars guilty of fearful cruelty.
