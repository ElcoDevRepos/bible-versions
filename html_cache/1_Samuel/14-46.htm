Saul's decision to cease pursuing the Philistines can be seen as a turning point, reflecting his inconsistent leadership and failure to fully capitalize on military victories. Historically, the Philistines were a constant threat to Israel, and Saul's inability to decisively defeat them foreshadows his eventual downfall. This moment also highlights Saul's impulsive nature, as earlier in the chapter, he had made a rash oath that hindered his army's effectiveness. Theologically, this can be seen as a failure to fully trust in God's deliverance, contrasting with David's later successes against the Philistines, which were marked by reliance on divine guidance.<p><b>and the Philistines returned to their own land</b><br>The Philistines retreating to their territory indicates a temporary cessation of hostilities, but not a permanent resolution. Geographically, the Philistines occupied the coastal regions of Canaan, including cities like Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. Their return to these strongholds suggests a strategic withdrawal rather than a defeat. This phrase also underscores the cyclical nature of Israel's conflicts with the Philistines throughout the period of the Judges and the early monarchy. In a broader biblical context, the Philistines often symbolize the persistent challenges and spiritual battles faced by God's people. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder of the need for continual vigilance and reliance on God in the face of recurring adversities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Earlier that day Jonathan&#8217;s daring faith (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>) sparked a miraculous panic in the Philistine camp, yet Saul&#8217;s rash oath that no one eat until evening (14:24) had already dulled the army&#8217;s strength and focus.<p>&#8226; The text portrays a moment of missed opportunity. Instead of pressing the advantage the Lord had provided, Saul stops short&#8212;echoing his earlier pattern of incomplete obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>; cf. 15:19-26).<p>&#8226; Why does he quit? The narrative hints at fatigue and disunity in the ranks (14:31-35), compounded by Saul&#8217;s desire to protect his own reputation rather than depend fully on God (compare with Gideon&#8217;s relentless chase in <a href="/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase therefore signals a retreat not commanded by God. <a href="/proverbs/24-10.htm">Proverbs 24:10</a> reminds that &#8220;If you falter in a day of distress, your strength is small.&#8221; Saul&#8217;s faltering shows how self-centered leadership can short-circuit God-given victory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Philistines returned to their own land</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the Philistines returned to their own land.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-46.htm">1 Samuel 14:46</a>)<p>&#8226; The enemy&#8217;s safe withdrawal guarantees future trouble. Indeed, only a short time later they reappear, culminating in Goliath&#8217;s challenge (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By letting them depart, Saul settles for a truce instead of the triumph God had hinted at through Jonathan&#8217;s words, &#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few&#8221; (14:6).<p>&#8226; Incomplete deliverance contradicts God&#8217;s earlier commands concerning Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>) and stands in contrast to David&#8217;s later zeal for total victory (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The result is a lingering war (<a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>).

He seems quietly to have acquiesced with Ahijah's evident reluctance to countenance a public pursuit; he drew off his forces then from the direction of the enemy, and went up, no doubt, to Gibeah; but the power of the Philistines for the time seems to have been utterly broken, and they retreated to their own districts along the sea coasts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul went up,</span> etc. Thus, as the final result of his self-will, Saul had to discontinue his pursuit of the Philistines, and their power, though weakened by the overthrow, remained unbroken.
