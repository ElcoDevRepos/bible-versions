This reflects the cultural norms of ancient Israel, where titles and respect for religious leaders were significant. The use of "lord" here is a term of respect, not divinity.<p><b>&#8220;said Hannah,&#8221;</b><br>Hannah is a central figure in this narrative, known for her deep faith and fervent prayer. Her story sets the stage for the birth of Samuel, a pivotal prophet in Israel's history. Her character is often seen as a model of piety and perseverance in prayer.<p><b>&#8220;as surely as you live, my lord,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is an oath, emphasizing the sincerity and truthfulness of her words. Oaths were common in biblical times to affirm the seriousness of a statement. It underscores the gravity of her previous vow to God regarding her son.<p><b>&#8220;I am the woman who stood here beside you&#8221;</b><br>Hannah reminds Eli of her previous presence and prayer at the temple. This reference to her past action highlights her persistence and faithfulness. It also serves as a narrative link to earlier in the chapter, where she was mistaken for being drunk due to her intense prayer.<p><b>&#8220;praying to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Hannah's prayer was directed to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. Her prayer was not just a request for a child but a vow to dedicate that child to God's service. This act of devotion is significant, as it leads to the birth of Samuel, who would become a major figure in Israel's history. Her prayer life is often compared to other biblical figures who sought God earnestly, such as David and Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman of faith, Hannah is the mother of Samuel.
