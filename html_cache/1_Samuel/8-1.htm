His leadership marked the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy. As he aged, the need for succession became apparent. The phrase indicates a natural progression of time and the challenges associated with aging leadership. In biblical context, aging leaders often faced the challenge of ensuring continuity of governance, as seen with Moses and Joshua.<p><b>he appointed his sons</b><br>Samuel's decision to appoint his sons, Joel and Abijah, as judges was significant. This act reflects a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures where leadership roles were often passed down within families. However, this decision was controversial, as it deviated from the divine appointment that characterized Samuel's own rise to leadership. The appointment of his sons highlights the human tendency to rely on familial succession rather than seeking God's guidance.<p><b>as judges over Israel</b><br>The role of a judge in Israel was not merely judicial but also included military and spiritual leadership. Judges were seen as deliverers raised by God to lead and protect Israel. Samuel's sons, however, did not follow in his righteous footsteps, as later verses reveal their corruption. This failure set the stage for Israel's demand for a king, highlighting the people's desire for a stable and just leadership. The appointment of judges connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the human need for righteous leadership, ultimately pointing to the perfect kingship of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge over Israel, Samuel was dedicated to God by his mother, Hannah, and served as a pivotal leader during a transitional period in Israel's history.

When the great disaster happened which resulted in the capture of the Ark of God and Eli's death. the young prophet was barely thirty years old. For the next twenty years we have seen how unweariedly he laboured to awaken in the people a sense of their deep degradation and of the real causes of their fallen state. Thus, when the great revolt and the Israelite victory at Eben-ezer took place, Samuel the judge was probably nearly fifty years of age. Another considerable apse of time must be assumed between the day of the uprising of the people and the throwing off the Philistine yoke and the events related at such length in the present chapter--the request of the people for an earthly king; for we must allow a sufficient lapse of time for the Philistines to have recovered the effects of their defeat at Eben-ezer, and again to have established themselves in power, at least in the southern districts of Canaan. A famous Hebrew commentator suggests seventy years of age as the most likely time of life. This supposition is, likely enough, a correct one.<p>The following little table, showing the events in the life of Samuel, will assist the student of the Bible story:--<p>1st period, 12 years 2 period about 15 to 20 years.<p>The child life in the Tabernacle service, under the guardianship of Eli. The boy is called by the holy Voice to be a prophet; Josephus states that this happened in his twelfth year. The boy-prophet remains in Shiloh The people gradually come to the knowledge that a new prophet had risen up among them. He stays with Eli until his death, after the disastrous battle of Aphek and the capture of the Ark. Shiloh was probably destroyed by the Philistines after the battle of Aphek.<p>3rd period, 20 year.<p>He works unweariedly up and down among the people, and rouses them to renounce idolatry, and under the Eternal's protection to win their freedom.<p>4th period, probably nearly 20 years. 5th period.<p>Samuel judges Israel, now a free nation, again. The Eternal God-Friend acknowledged by the people as King. Samuel the seer and judge and Saul the king govern Israel.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">They were judges in Beer-sheba.</span>--It was natural that the father, as the infirmities of old age were beginning to make his toilsome life more burden some, should turn to his sons, and endeavour to train them up to share in his high duties, but beyond the natural regret of a father that the honours and dignities he had himself so hardly won should pass from his house for ever, no murmur seems to have escaped Samuel's lips when the will of the Eternal was made known to him; and the aged prophet, forgetting he had sons and a house which bore his name, was the principal agent in the establishment of the king, in whom all the powers of the judge were to be merged. It is probable that at the time when old age was beginning to enfeeble the strength of Samuel, and many of the duties devolved upon his worthless sons, the Philistines recovered much of their lost power over the southern districts of Israel. The names of these sons are especially significant of the holy atmosphere their father lived in. Joel signifies Jehovah is God; and Abiah, Jehovah a Father. But the glorious traditions of Samuel were quickly forgotten by these unworthy men who called him father. Josephus supplements the Biblical record by stating that while one of these sons remained in Beer-sheba, the other "judged" in the north of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Samuel was old.</span> As Samuel lived for very many years after this time, till towards the close of Saul's reign, he was probably not more than sixty when this happened. The dates are all very uncertain, but he was probably between twenty and thirty when Shiloh was captured, and no doubt, according to Israelite custom, had married as soon as he arrived at manhood. Then came the most important and active period of his life, during which the ark rested for twenty years in the house of Abinadab, and Samuel was traversing every part of the country, preaching repentance, and preparing the people for a revolt from the tyranny of the Philistines. Upon this followed the victory at Mizpah, and the establishment of Samuel as judge. Now some considerable time would elapse before Samuel so felt the weight of increasing years as to delegate a part of his authority to his sons, and more again before the national discontent at their covetousness became general. The Talmud, however, represents Samuel as being at this time only fifty-two years of age, while Abravanel says seventy, and the latter number is by no means impossible; for as a Nazarite Samuel would lead a life of perfect temperance, and his predecessor Eli lived to be ninety-eight, and died then by an accident. Still, probably, Abravanel's calculation is too high, and we must remember that besides the misconduct of Samuel's sons, there was the growing danger of the re-establishment of the domination of the Philistines to quicken the people's movements. They had garrisons again in Israel when Saul was chosen king, and it was this which made the nation long for a change, but. their choice would probably have fallen upon one of Samuel's sons had either of them been worthy. A king they had long wished for; it is only when they saw that none of Samuel's race would give them internal peace and security that they took public action for the appointment of some one else. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
