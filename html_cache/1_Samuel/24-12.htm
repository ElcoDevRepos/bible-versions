In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>, David spares King Saul's life in the cave at En Gedi, demonstrating his respect for God's anointed king despite Saul's pursuit to kill him. The appeal to the LORD as judge underscores the biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," which is echoed in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>. This reliance on God for justice is a recurring theme in David's life, as seen in his psalms, where he often calls upon God to judge his enemies.<p><b>and may the LORD take vengeance on you</b><br>David entrusts the matter of vengeance to God, aligning with the biblical teaching that God is the ultimate arbiter of justice. This reflects a deep faith in God's sovereignty and righteousness. The cultural context of the time often involved personal vendettas and blood feuds, but David's response is countercultural, emphasizing forgiveness and trust in God's timing. This foreshadows the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where believers are instructed to love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them.<p><b>but my hand will never be against you</b><br>David's declaration of non-violence towards Saul is significant, as it highlights his respect for Saul's position as the LORD's anointed. This restraint is a testament to David's character and his understanding of God's will. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, despite being wronged, did not retaliate but entrusted himself to God who judges justly (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). David's commitment to peace and his refusal to harm Saul, even when he had the opportunity, exemplifies the biblical principle of overcoming evil with good, as later articulated by Paul in <a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

He echoes what he will later say again: &#8220;The LORD will repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>).<p>&#8226; This posture keeps his conscience clean&#8212;he is confident God sees both hearts. Paul will later summarize the same attitude: &#8220;It is a righteous thing with God to repay tribulation to those who trouble you&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and may the LORD take vengeance on you</b><p>&#8226; David acknowledges that wrong has been done; justice is necessary, but it belongs to God.<p>&#8226; He aligns with Moses: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>), a truth echoed in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;Leave room for God&#8217;s wrath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By speaking this aloud, David releases personal bitterness, affirming that only the Lord can execute perfect recompense (<a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This allows him to keep honoring Saul&#8217;s office as the anointed king while still naming Saul&#8217;s sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but my hand will never be against you</b><p>&#8226; David draws a line: no personal retaliation, no matter the provocation.
