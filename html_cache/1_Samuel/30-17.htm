The context is David's pursuit of the Amalekites, who had raided Ziklag, capturing the families of David and his men. The term "twilight" suggests a surprise attack, a common tactic in ancient warfare, indicating David's strategic acumen. The extended duration of the battle, "until the evening of the next day," underscores the intensity and thoroughness of the conflict. This victory can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David, as he inquired of the Lord before pursuing the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>). The complete defeat of the enemy also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as David is often seen as a type of Christ.<p><b>Not a man escaped, except four hundred young men who fled,</b><br>The phrase "not a man escaped" emphasizes the totality of David's victory, showcasing his leadership and the effectiveness of his forces. The mention of "four hundred young men" who fled highlights the desperation and disarray among the Amalekites. The number four hundred is significant in biblical narratives, often representing a substantial group, yet in this context, it is a remnant compared to the total force David faced. This escape of a small group contrasts with the complete recovery of all that was taken from David and his men, illustrating God's provision and faithfulness.<p><b>riding off on camels.</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in ancient Near Eastern cultures, used for long-distance travel and trade due to their endurance in desert conditions. The fact that the young men fled "riding off on camels" indicates their preparedness for a quick escape, suggesting that the Amalekites anticipated the possibility of needing to retreat. This detail also reflects the historical and cultural context of the time, where camels were a symbol of wealth and mobility. The use of camels by the fleeing Amalekites contrasts with the Israelites, who primarily used donkeys and horses, highlighting the differences in resources and lifestyle between the two groups.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership and reliance on God.

God allowed a remnant to flee, proving the historical realism of the account; this is no embellished tale.<p>2. Their survival underscores the continuing presence of Amalekite opposition, which resurfaces in later generations (cf. <a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, four hundred is the same number of men David had when his own exile began (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), showing how tables can turn under God&#8217;s providence.<p>&#8226; Camels, swift &#8220;ships of the desert&#8221; (Jud 7:12), explain their getaway, yet even that speed could not deliver them from eventual extinction foretold in Scripture (<a href="/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a> records a literal, decisive victory granted to David because he sought and followed the Lord&#8217;s guidance. The verse unfolds like a four-part snapshot: determined action, sustained effort, complete judgment, and a small, telling escape. Together they reveal a God who keeps His word, empowers His people, and finishes what He starts&#8212;both in battle and in the lives of those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">From twilight even unto the evening of the next day.</span>--Keil thinks the fighting went on from the evening twilight till the evening of the next day. Bishop Hervey, in the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary, </span>with greater probability, supposes that "the twilight is the morning twilight, as the contrast between twilight and evening rather suggests." David thus arrived at night, and finding his enemies eating and drinking, put off his attack until the morning dawn or twilight, when they would be still sleeping after their debauch. Although thus taken by surprise, their great numbers and their natural bravery enabled them to prolong the fierce struggle all through the day, and when the shades of evening were falling four hundred (we read) of the young men, a body of fugitives equal to David's own force, managed to get clear of the rout and escape. The number of slain on this occasion must have been very great.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the twilight</span>. It has been debated whether this means the evening or the morning twilight; but the words which follow, "unto the evening of the next day," literally, "of (or <span class="accented">for</span>) their morrow," seem to prove that it was in the evening that David arrived. Moreover, in the morning they would not have been feasting, but sleeping. David probably attacked them at once, and slew all within reach until nightfall. The next morning the battle was renewed; but as David had but 400 men, and the Amalekites covered a large extent of country, and probably tried to defend themselves and their booty, it was not till towards the next evening that the combat and the pursuit were over. As they would need pasture and water for their cattle, they had evidently broken up into detachments, which had gone each into a different place with their herds. The pursuit must have been prolonged to a considerable distance, as no more than 400 young men escaped, and even they only by the aid of their camels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">struck them down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yak&#183;k&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
