Elkanah, a devout man, followed the Mosaic Law, which required sacrifices and offerings at the central place of worship. This reflects the religious practices of ancient Israel, where families would travel to offer sacrifices, a practice rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>. The act of presenting a sacrifice was a demonstration of obedience and devotion to God, and it underscores the importance of worship in the life of an Israelite family.<p><b>he would give portions to his wife Peninnah</b><br>Elkanah's distribution of portions to Peninnah signifies the sharing of the sacrificial meal, a common practice after offering sacrifices. This act was not only a religious duty but also a familial one, ensuring that all members of the household participated in the blessings of the sacrifice. Peninnah, as one of Elkanah's wives, received her share, highlighting the polygamous practices of the time, which were culturally accepted though often fraught with tension, as seen in the narrative of Sarah and Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>.<p><b>and to all her sons and daughters</b><br>The mention of Peninnah's sons and daughters emphasizes her fertility, contrasting with Hannah's barrenness, which is a central theme in the narrative. In ancient Israel, children were considered a blessing from God, and a large family was a sign of divine favor. This cultural context sets the stage for the tension between Peninnah and Hannah, as Peninnah's fruitful womb stands in stark contrast to Hannah's childlessness, echoing the stories of other biblical matriarchs like Rachel and Leah in <a href="/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-30</a>. The distribution of portions to Peninnah's children also reflects the communal aspect of worship and the importance of family unity in religious observance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A devout man from the hill country of Ephraim, Elkanah is the husband of both Hannah and Peninnah.

Verse 3 notes that he &#8220;went up from his city year after year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts in Shiloh,&#8221; echoing the pattern prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6&#8211;7</a> and reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>, where every Israelite male was to appear before the LORD with offerings.<p>&#8226; Elkanah&#8217;s obedience models wholehearted devotion; like Joshua, he could say, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By tying worship to a specific &#8220;day,&#8221; Scripture underscores the appointed times God established for His people (<a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>). This verse reminds believers that worship is neither casual nor sporadic; it is disciplined, joyful participation in God&#8217;s set order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he would give portions to his wife Peninnah</b><p>&#8226; The portions came from a peace offering, a sacrifice where the worshiper and his family shared a meal in the LORD&#8217;s presence (<a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Peninnah&#8217;s receipt of these portions shows Elkanah&#8217;s responsibility and generosity as the household head, similar to Boaz&#8217;s kindness to Ruth at the table (<a href="/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Peninnah later provokes Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>), here she benefits from the covenant blessing of shared fellowship, illustrating Jesus&#8217; teaching that &#8220;where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>). Elkanah&#8217;s heart is clearly set on honoring God and caring for his family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to all her sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights Peninnah&#8217;s fertility&#8212;she had &#8220;sons and daughters,&#8221; a direct contrast to Hannah&#8217;s barrenness at this point. Children are repeatedly called a heritage from the LORD (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The distribution of meat to each child aligns with the Mosaic command to rejoice with &#8220;your sons and daughters&#8221; before the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene echoes earlier family tensions in Scripture: Leah bore many children while Rachel waited (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31-30</a>:24). God&#8217;s purposes unfolded through both women, showing that His timing is perfect and His plans reach beyond immediate appearances.<p>&#8226; By noting every son and daughter, the writer signals that Elkanah&#8217;s provision was comprehensive. No member of the household was overlooked&#8212;mirroring God&#8217;s own character, who &#8220;opens His hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/1-4.htm">1 Samuel 1:4</a> portrays a godly man faithfully keeping the sacrificial calendar, generously sharing the fellowship offering with his entire household. Elkanah&#8217;s inclusive distribution to Peninnah and each of her children spotlights God-centered leadership and sets up the poignant contrast with Hannah&#8217;s childlessness, preparing readers for the gracious intervention the LORD is about to provide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And whenever the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
