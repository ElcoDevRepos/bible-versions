The "day of battle" refers to a specific confrontation with the Philistines, a recurring enemy of Israel. The Philistines were a formidable force, often technologically superior, particularly in metallurgy, which is significant in understanding the Israelites' lack of weapons.<p><b>not a sword or spear could be found</b><br>This highlights the dire situation of the Israelite army. The Philistines had a monopoly on iron production, as noted in <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-21</a>, which left the Israelites at a severe disadvantage. This lack of weapons symbolizes Israel's vulnerability and dependence on God for deliverance, as they could not rely on their own military strength.<p><b>in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan</b><br>Saul and Jonathan were the leaders of the Israelite forces. The mention of "troops with Saul and Jonathan" emphasizes the unity and leadership structure within the Israelite army. However, the absence of weapons among the troops underscores the desperate circumstances and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons</b><br>This detail underscores the scarcity of resources and the centralization of power and responsibility in the hands of the king and his heir. It also foreshadows Jonathan's significant role in the upcoming battle, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>, where his faith and courage lead to a victory against the Philistines. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jonathan's faith and leadership prefigure the ultimate deliverance brought by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The phrase signals urgency&#8212;this is the very moment when courage and preparation are tested.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>), the Philistines field &#8220;thirty thousand chariots,&#8221; underscoring the human impossibility Israel faces.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights decisive &#8220;days of battle&#8221; where the Lord&#8217;s people must trust Him (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal timing reminds us that God sets the hour of conflict and deliverance (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not a sword or spear could be found</b><p>The text continues: &#8220;&#8230;not a sword or spear could be found&#8230;.&#8221; This is no exaggeration; <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-20</a> already explained that Philistine policy had removed blacksmiths from Israel, forcing Israelites to rely on the enemy even to sharpen farm tools.<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a> describes a similar era: &#8220;shield or spear was not seen among forty thousand in Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God allows this shortage to strip away self-reliance and showcase His power (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, Israel marches to war with wooden clubs and farm implements against iron weapons&#8212;humanly unwinnable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan</b><p>The lack of arms specifically affects &#8220;the troops with Saul and Jonathan.&#8221; Kings and princes normally equip their own men, yet even the royal guard is disarmed.<p>&#8226; Saul, chosen to &#8220;save My people from the hand of the Philistines&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), now stands helpless apart from God.<p>&#8226; The episode exposes the consequences of Saul&#8217;s earlier disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>). When leadership falters spiritually, material shortages often follow.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> reminds us, &#8220;A king is not saved by his large army; a warrior is not delivered by great strength.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons</b><p>The verse concludes: &#8220;&#8230;only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.&#8221; Two swords against a vast Philistine force appear laughable, yet the Lord delights in small odds.<p>&#8226; Jonathan soon proves this by attacking a Philistine outpost single-handedly (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-15</a>), echoing Gideon&#8217;s tiny band in <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a> frames the spiritual lesson: &#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast also foreshadows David&#8217;s lone sling against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). God often begins national deliverance through one faithful individual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a> depicts a literal battlefield where Israel possesses almost no weapons. This physical deficiency spotlights spiritual realities: God&#8217;s people are forced to abandon confidence in human resources, leaders must repent of disobedience, and victory will ultimately come through the Lord working through a few faithful hearts. Two swords in faithful hands become enough when the Lord of hosts fights for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">There was neither sword nor spear.</span>--These words must not be pressed too literally. The general result of the raids alluded to in <a href="/context/1_samuel/13-16.htm" title="And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.">1Samuel 13:16-17</a> was that in the open valleys of Southern Canaan, especially in the Benjamite territory, the districts whence Saul and Jonathan could most easily recruit their thinned and dispirited forces, there was an absence of arms. This fact is especially dwelt upon, for the Philistines appear to have armed their fighting men to the teeth. (Compare the description of their champion, Goliath, who is described as "clad in armour.")<p><span class= "bld">But with Saul.</span>--These words probably signify that the companies of regulars, who throughout this disastrous period were always with the king and prince, were--in contrast to the country people around--fully armed.

The Ammonites probably were far less efficiently armed than the Philistines, who, as commanding the sea coast, could import weapons from Greece. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
