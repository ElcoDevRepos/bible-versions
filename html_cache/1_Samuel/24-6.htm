This moment occurs in the wilderness of En Gedi, a rugged area providing natural fortresses and hiding places. David's leadership is evident as he communicates his moral and spiritual convictions to his men, emphasizing the importance of integrity and respect for God's chosen authority.<p><b>The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing</b><br>David acknowledges a divine moral standard, recognizing that his actions must align with God's will. This phrase reflects David's deep reverence for God and his understanding of divine sovereignty. It highlights the biblical principle of leaving vengeance to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are instructed not to take revenge but to leave room for God's wrath.<p><b>To my master, the LORD&#8217;s anointed</b><br>David refers to Saul as "my master," showing respect and acknowledging Saul's position as the king anointed by God. The concept of being "the LORD's anointed" is significant in the Old Testament, as it denotes someone chosen by God for a specific purpose, often involving leadership or deliverance. This anointing is a sacred act, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a> when Samuel anoints Saul. David's respect for this anointing reflects his understanding of God's authority and timing.<p><b>May I never lift my hand against him</b><br>David expresses his commitment to non-violence against Saul, despite having the opportunity to harm him. This restraint is a testament to David's character and his reliance on God's justice. It also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, where believers are called to love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>Since he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed</b><br>Reiterating Saul's divine appointment, David underscores the sacredness of God's choice. This acknowledgment serves as a reminder of the respect due to those whom God has placed in positions of authority, regardless of their personal failings. It also points to the messianic expectation of a future anointed one, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the ultimate "Anointed One" or Messiah, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is seeking to kill David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cave_at_en_gedi.htm">The Cave at En Gedi</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness where David and his men are hiding, and where Saul unknowingly enters.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David&#8217;s Men</a></b><br>Loyal followers of David who encourage him to take advantage of the opportunity to kill Saul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_anointed.htm">The LORD&#8217;s Anointed</a></b><br>A term referring to Saul, emphasizing his divine appointment as king despite his current disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_anointed.htm">Respect for God&#8217;s Anointed</a></b><br>David&#8217;s refusal to harm Saul highlights the importance of respecting those whom God has placed in authority, even when they are flawed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God&#8217;s Timing</a></b><br>David&#8217;s decision to wait on God&#8217;s timing for his ascension to the throne teaches us to trust in God&#8217;s plan rather than taking matters into our own hands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_adversity.htm">Integrity in Adversity</a></b><br>David&#8217;s integrity in sparing Saul&#8217;s life, despite the pressure from his men, serves as a model for maintaining righteousness under pressure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_restraint.htm">The Power of Restraint</a></b><br>Exercising restraint and choosing not to retaliate against those who wrong us can be a powerful testimony of faith and obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_conscience.htm">The Role of Conscience</a></b><br>David&#8217;s conscience is sensitive to God&#8217;s will, reminding us to cultivate a conscience that aligns with God&#8217;s Word and Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_24_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 24:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_spare_Saul_in_1_Sam_24_6.htm">Why did David refuse to harm Saul, "the LORD's anointed," in 1 Samuel 24:6?
