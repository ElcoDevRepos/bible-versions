This acknowledgment is significant as it reflects a moment of self-awareness, yet it lacks genuine repentance. Saul's confession is more about the consequences of his actions rather than a heartfelt turning back to God. This contrasts with David's later genuine repentance in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>. Saul's admission is similar to Pharaoh's in <a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>, where the acknowledgment of sin is more about alleviating immediate consequences than true repentance.<p><b>&#8220;Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's request for honor reveals his concern with public perception and status. In ancient Israelite culture, honor and shame were pivotal social values. Saul's focus on maintaining his honor before the elders and the people indicates a prioritization of human approval over divine approval. This reflects a broader biblical theme where leaders are often tempted to seek the favor of men rather than God, as seen in <a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>, where the Pharisees loved human praise more than praise from God.<p><b>&#8220;Come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's invitation to Samuel to return with him is an attempt to restore his standing and legitimacy as king. The phrase "the LORD your God" suggests a distancing from a personal relationship with God, contrasting with David's intimate relationship with God, as seen in the Psalms. Saul's focus on external worship rather than internal transformation highlights a recurring biblical theme where God desires obedience and a contrite heart over ritualistic worship, as emphasized in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>. Saul's request for Samuel's presence underscores the prophet's role as a mediator between God and the king, a role that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

True repentance confesses sin, seeks God&#8217;s glory above human approval, pursues God&#8217;s presence for its own sake, and owns a personal relationship with Him&#8212;everything Saul&#8217;s words lacked.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders.</span>--It was a strange penitence, after all, this sorrow of Saul for his great sin. He was, no doubt, terribly in earnest and in great fear; but his earnestness was based upon a desire to maintain his power and royal state, and his fear sprang from a well-grounded apprehension that if he lost the countenance of Samuel the seer, the revered and honoured servant of the Lord, he would probably forfeit his crown. "If Saul had been really penitent, he would pray to have been humble rather than to be honoured" (<span class= "ital">St. Gregory, </span>quoted by Wordsworth).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, I have sinned.</span> We have here no real confession of guilt. Even in ver. 24 the words were rather an expression of vexation at the strictness with which he was held to the letter of the command, than an acknowledgment that he really had done wrong. Here Saul's meaning seems to be, Well, granting that I have sinned, and that this sentence of exclusion kern the kingdom is passed upon me, yet at least pay me the honor due to the rank which I still continue to hold. And to this request Samuel accedes. Saul was <span class="accented">de facto</span> king, and would continue to be so during his lifetime. The anointing, once bestowed, was a consecration for life, and so generally it was in the days of the son that the consequences of the father's sin came fully to pass (<a href="/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34, 35</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13</a>, etc.). Had Samuel refused the public honour due to Saul's rank, it would have given an occasion for intrigue and resistance to all who were disaffected with Saul's government, and been a step towards bringing back the old anarchy. <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah thy God.</span> See on ver. 13. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have sinned,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul replied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
