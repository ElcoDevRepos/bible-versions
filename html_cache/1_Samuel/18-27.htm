The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles with the Israelites. David's ability to lead his men to victory against such a formidable enemy demonstrates his growing reputation as a warrior. This act also fulfills King Saul's challenge to David, which was intended to be a dangerous task. The number "two hundred" is significant as it exceeds Saul's original demand of one hundred, showcasing David's dedication and perhaps his desire to ensure Saul's satisfaction or to demonstrate his capability.<p><b>He brought their foreskins and presented them as payment in full to become the king&#8217;s son-in-law.</b><br>The collection of foreskins as a bride price is a unique and culturally specific practice. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a bride price was often required for marriage, and Saul's demand for Philistine foreskins was both a test of David's bravery and a means to endanger him. The foreskins served as proof of the Philistines' deaths, as they were uncircumcised, unlike the Israelites. This act also symbolizes David's commitment to fulfilling Saul's condition for marriage, despite the inherent danger. It reflects the cultural and religious tensions between the Israelites and the Philistines, emphasizing the covenantal sign of circumcision for the Israelites.<p><b>Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David in marriage.</b><br>Michal's marriage to David is significant in several ways. It solidifies David's position within the royal family, aligning him more closely with Saul. However, Saul's motivations were not entirely benevolent; he hoped that the marriage would be a snare for David, as seen in earlier verses. Michal's love for David, mentioned in previous chapters, adds a personal dimension to this political alliance. This marriage also sets the stage for future conflicts and developments in David's life, as Michal's loyalty will later be tested. The union is a pivotal moment in David's rise to power, marking a transition from a shepherd boy to a member of the royal household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.
