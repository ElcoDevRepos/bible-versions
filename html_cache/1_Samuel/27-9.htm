This period reflects a strategic and survival-driven phase in David's life, as he sought refuge from King Saul. The territories he attacked were often those of Israel's traditional enemies, such as the Amalekites, who had long been a thorn in Israel's side (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). David's actions can be seen as fulfilling God's earlier commands to Israel to drive out these nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p><b>he did not leave a man or woman alive</b><br>This phrase highlights the completeness of David's raids. By leaving no survivors, David ensured that no one could report his activities back to Achish, the Philistine king. This tactic was not uncommon in ancient warfare, where total destruction was sometimes employed to prevent future retaliation or intelligence leaks. It also reflects the harsh realities of survival and warfare in the ancient Near East.<p><b>but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing</b><br>David's acquisition of livestock and goods was a common practice in ancient raids, serving both as spoils of war and as resources for his men. The mention of specific animals like camels indicates the wealth and variety of resources in these regions. This practice also aligns with the biblical principle of the transfer of wealth from the wicked to the righteous (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p><b>Then he would return to Achish</b><br>David's return to Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, underscores his complex relationship with the Philistines. While David was a fugitive from Saul, he found temporary asylum with Israel's enemies. His ability to maintain Achish's trust, despite his raids against Philistine allies, demonstrates his cunning and strategic acumen. This period foreshadows David's future as a wise and resourceful king, capable of navigating complex political landscapes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who provides refuge to David during his time of exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were often in conflict with Israel; David is living among them during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/raids.htm">Raids</a></b><br>David conducts raids against various groups, ensuring no survivors to prevent news of his actions from reaching Achish.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town given to David by Achish, from which David launches his raids.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>David's actions, while strategic, reflect a period of waiting for God's promise of kingship.

Achish, king of Gath, grants him Ziklag (27:6&#8211;7). To secure both his men&#8217;s livelihood and his own cover story, David raids long-standing enemies of Israel such as the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites (27:8). Note the pattern:<p>&#8226; Regular, calculated sorties&#8212;&#8220;whenever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Targets outside Israel&#8217;s borders, preserving his true loyalty (compare <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s earlier commands to drive out these peoples (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>) echo behind David&#8217;s actions, showing continuity with divine instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he did not leave a man or woman alive</b><p>This sober line underscores total destruction. The text states the fact without apology, reflecting Israel&#8217;s holy-war ethic in certain contexts (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). Why the severity?<p>&#8226; Prevents survivors from reporting David&#8217;s real movements to Achish&#8212;protecting his subterfuge (27:11).<p>&#8226; Removes the possibility of these idolatrous cultures influencing Israel (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Completes judgments God had already pronounced (<a href="/1_samuel/15-18.htm">1 Samuel 15:18, 32</a>-33).<p>Taken literally, it shows David acting decisively, though not cruelly for cruelty&#8217;s sake; he is fulfilling a specific, historic judgment while shielding his people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing</b><p>Spoils were customary in ancient warfare (<a href="/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11-16</a>).

He consistently strikes Israel&#8217;s ancient foes, eliminates witnesses, gathers essential supplies, and reports to Achish to maintain cover. The verse reflects earlier divine mandates against those nations, highlights God&#8217;s provision for David&#8217;s exiled band, and showcases the Lord&#8217;s unseen hand turning even David&#8217;s risky deception into preparation for the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And left neither man nor woman alive.</span>--These acts of ferocious barbarity are simply without excuse; the reason for them is told us in <a href="/1_samuel/27-11.htm" title="And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines.">1Samuel 27:11</a>. No captive was to be left alive to tell the tale to King Achish, who was under the delusion that David's feats of arms were carried out at the expense of his own countrymen, whose lands he was harrying. At this the Philistine rejoiced when he heard David was thus burning his only bridge of retreat: by alienating by these cruelties the affection of the people of Israel, by means of which, at some future time, he might have been recalled to his native land. There were a few occasions in the history of the chosen race when a war of extermination was commended. Then Israel was simply the stern instrument of wrath, used--as a pestilence is at times--to carry out the will of the earth's Master; but David had no such charge. Was it not these acts of ruthless cruelty which left on this king's hands the stain of blood which rendered them unfit in after days to build the House of the Lord he longed so passionately to erect? (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel.</span>--To fight under David's banner now promised to be a lucrative service as well as an adventurous and wild career. Here at Ziklag, and for some time previously, we hear of brave discontented spirits from all parts of Israel joining him. In 1 Chronicles 12 we have a long and accurate list of heroes who formed that Ziklag band. Amongst these gallant soldiers who now, to use the chronicler's term, "day by day came to David to help him," were a troop of Benjamites who had joined him some time before: their leader Amasai, on being questioned as to their reason for joining him, answered, "We are on thy side, thou son of Jesse . . . for thy God helpeth thee" (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm" title="Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.">1Chronicles 12:18</a>). The words of Amasai express the feeling which seems to have pervaded Israel at that time in reference to David. The people throughout the land were coming to feel that Jehovah had indeed chosen David. The chronicler even speaks of David's band at Ziklag, after the recruits from all parts of Israel had poured in, "as a great host, like the host of God" (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-22.htm" title="For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.">1Chronicles 12:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David smote the land.</span> These expeditions were made partly to occupy his men, but chiefly to obtain the means of subsistence. They also seem to have brought David great renown, for in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-22</a> we read of warriors from far distant tribes coming to him to swell his forces, and the enthusiasm for him was even such that a band of men swam across the Jordan to join him (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 15); while others from Manasseh deserted to him from Saul's army before the battle of Mount Gilboa, so that at last he had with him "a great host, like the host of God" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 19-21). <span class="cmt_word">He came to Achish.</span> To give him a portion of the spoil. <span class="cmt_word">And Achish said.</span> Like the verb <span class="accented">went up</span> in ver. 8, the word indicates repeated action. David made many expeditions against these wild tribes, and on each occasion, when presenting himself at Gath, Achish would inquire, <span class="cmt_word">Whither have ye made a road</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an inroad, or a raid - <span class="cmt_word">today</span>? As it stands the Hebrew means, "Do not make an inroad today;" but the cor. rection of the text given in the A.V. has considerable authority from the versions. <span class="cmt_word">The Jerahmeelites,</span> mentioned again in ch. 30:29, were the descendants of Hezron, the firstborn of Pharez, the son of Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>), and so were one of the great families into which the tribe of Judah was divided. Apparently they occupied the most southerly position of its territory. <span class="cmt_word">The Kenites</span> (see on ch. 15:6) are here described as being in close alliance with the men of Judah. Probably they lived under their protection, and paid them tribute. <span class="cmt_word">The south</span> is literally "the Negeb," the dry land, so called from the absence of streams (comp. <a href="/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>), which formed not only the southernmost part of the territory of Judah, but extended far into the Arabian desert.
