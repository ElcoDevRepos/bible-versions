David is speaking directly to Saul, highlighting that Saul himself has witnessed the situation. This personal testimony is crucial in biblical narratives, as it underscores the authenticity and truth of the events. In the broader biblical context, seeing with one's own eyes is often associated with understanding and acknowledging God's work (e.g., <a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>).<p><b>that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave.</b><br>The cave is likely located in the wilderness of En Gedi, a region known for its rugged terrain and numerous caves, providing a strategic hiding place for David. The phrase "the LORD delivered" indicates divine intervention, a recurring theme in David's life, where God orchestrates events for His purposes. This echoes other instances where God delivers enemies into the hands of His chosen ones, such as in <a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<p><b>I was told to kill you,</b><br>This reflects the counsel David received from his men, who saw this as an opportunity to eliminate Saul, his pursuer. It highlights the tension between human advice and divine will. The cultural context of the time often justified the killing of one's enemy, especially in a situation of self-defense or political rivalry. However, David's restraint shows his commitment to God's higher law.<p><b>but I spared you</b><br>David's decision to spare Saul demonstrates his mercy and respect for God's anointed. This act of mercy is a type of Christ, who also showed mercy to His enemies (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). David's restraint is a powerful example of overcoming evil with good, a principle later articulated in <a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>.<p><b>and said, &#8216;I will not lift my hand against my lord,</b><br>David refers to Saul as "my lord," acknowledging Saul's position as king. This respect for authority is consistent with biblical teachings on submission to governing authorities (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). David's refusal to harm Saul, despite the opportunity, reflects his understanding of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders.<p><b>since he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;</b><br>The term "the LORD&#8217;s anointed" refers to Saul's consecration as king, chosen by God through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). This anointing signifies a divine appointment and protection. David's respect for this anointing shows his reverence for God's decisions and foreshadows the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah, the ultimate Anointed One (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.
