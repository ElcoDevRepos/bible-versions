The use of a boy to retrieve arrows is a strategic choice, allowing Jonathan to convey a message without arousing suspicion. This reflects the tense political climate and the need for secrecy. The act of sending a boy also highlights the innocence and unawareness of the child, contrasting with the gravity of the situation. The use of arrows as a signal is practical and discreet, fitting the context of ancient warfare and communication methods.<p><b>Now, if I expressly say to him, &#8216;Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them,&#8217;</b><br>Jonathan's specific instructions to the boy serve as a coded message to David. The phrase "on this side of you" indicates safety and a lack of threat from Saul. This method of communication underscores the deep trust and friendship between Jonathan and David, as well as Jonathan's loyalty to David despite his father Saul's hostility. The careful planning reflects the wisdom and discernment needed in navigating dangerous political landscapes.<p><b>then come, because as surely as the LORD lives, it is safe for you, and there is no danger.</b><br>Jonathan invokes the name of the LORD, emphasizing the seriousness and truthfulness of his message. This phrase reassures David of his safety, highlighting Jonathan's role as a protector and ally. The invocation of the LORD's name also reflects the covenantal relationship between Jonathan and David, rooted in their shared faith and commitment to God's will. This assurance of safety is a moment of divine providence, where God's protection over David is affirmed through Jonathan's actions. The phrase "as surely as the LORD lives" is a common biblical oath, underscoring the certainty and reliability of the promise being made.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
