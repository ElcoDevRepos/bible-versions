His role as a priest was to mediate between God and the people, providing spiritual guidance and maintaining the sacred rituals. This interaction highlights the priest's involvement in David's life during a time of need.<p><b>&#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here;</b><br>This refers to the sword of Goliath, the giant Philistine warrior whom David defeated as a young shepherd boy. The Valley of Elah is the location of this famous battle, a significant event that demonstrated God's power working through David. The sword symbolizes David's past victory and God's deliverance.<p><b>it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod.</b><br>The ephod was a priestly garment, often associated with seeking God's will. The sword being wrapped in a cloth and placed behind the ephod suggests it was kept as a sacred relic, a reminder of God's intervention. This placement indicates the sword's importance and the reverence with which it was treated.<p><b>If you want, you may take it.</b><br>Ahimelech offers the sword to David, recognizing his need for a weapon. This offer reflects the priest's willingness to assist David, despite the potential risks involved, as David was fleeing from King Saul at the time.<p><b>For there is no other but this one here.&#8221;</b><br>The exclusivity of the sword emphasizes its uniqueness and significance. It was the only weapon available to David at that moment, highlighting his vulnerability and reliance on God's provision.<p><b>And David said, &#8220;There is none like it; give it to me.&#8221;</b><br>David's response acknowledges the sword's unmatched value, both as a weapon and as a symbol of God's past faithfulness. By requesting the sword, David not only arms himself physically but also draws strength from the memory of God's deliverance. This moment foreshadows David's future reliance on God for victory and protection, paralleling the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

In the flow of 1 Samuel, this moment follows David&#8217;s plea for consecrated bread (21:6), underscoring that the Lord meets both physical and defensive needs when His anointed is on the run (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sword of Goliath the Philistine</b><p>&#8226;

For David, this phrase re-opens the memory of God&#8217;s faithfulness, paralleling how believers recall past deliverances to face fresh trials (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is here;

Wrapped in cloth, the weapon is treated with reverence, reminding us that even physical objects tied to God&#8217;s acts are to be honored, much like the Ark was (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you want, you may take it</b><p>&#8226;

Taking Goliath&#8217;s weapon signals that past victories fuel present courage; the same God who felled the giant will now protect His servant in exile (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, David arms himself, yet his trust remains in the Lord, aligning with <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a> captures a moment where God&#8217;s past deliverance (Goliath&#8217;s defeat) becomes present provision (the sword) for David&#8217;s future journey. The priest&#8217;s offer, the sword&#8217;s sacred storage, and David&#8217;s eager acceptance weave together themes of divine faithfulness, human agency, and the irreplaceable sufficiency of what God supplies. Remembering earlier victories strengthens trust for present trials, and the Lord&#8217;s unique provisions&#8212;whether a giant&#8217;s sword or His living Word&#8212;remain unmatched resources for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The sword of Goliath the Philistine.</span>--It was in safe guardianship, that trusty sword of the mightiest of the Philistines, stained perhaps with the blood of the brave but unworthy priests, Hophni and Phineas, the sons of Eli, whom Goliath was believed to have slain in the fatal battle when the Ark was taken, and the power of Israel shattered for many a long year. It was wrapped up and lying in a place of honour behind the sacred ephod with the Urim and Thummim--wrapped up, it has been suggested, in the blood-stained war cloak of the dead Philistine, for the word translated "cloth" is used in <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5</a> of military attire.<p><span class= "bld">Give it me.</span>--David grasped the sword with a childlike expression of joy; its sight and touch revived the old bright faith and the sure trust in the strength of Israel on which he leaned when, as a boy, he fought with the wild beasts which infested the wild pasture-lands where he kept his father's flocks (the Shepherd of David was the Holy One; blessed be He.--<span class= "ital">Midrash Rabbah, </span>59), and which guided his trembling hand the day he slew the giant in the face of the watching hosts. The sight and touch of the glorious trophy revived the old sure trust which in these dark days of betrayal and persecution was beginning to fail that gallant spirit of David's. It does not appear from the story that the Philistine's sword was of extraordinary size; that it was a tried weapon of approved temper and strength is certain, but its chief preciousness consisted, of course, in its storied associations. The Dean of Canterbury suggests it was probably of the ordinary pattern imported from Greece. The LXX. adds here, "and he gave it to him."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;The sword</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2719.htm">Strong's 2719: </a> </span><span class="str2">Drought, a cutting instrument, as a, knife, sword</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Goliath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1555.htm">Strong's 1555: </a> </span><span class="str2">Goliath -- a Philistine giant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistine,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you killed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;
