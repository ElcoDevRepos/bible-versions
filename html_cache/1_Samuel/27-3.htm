Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities and was known for its formidable warriors, including Goliath, whom David had previously defeated. This move might seem surprising given the historical enmity between Israel and the Philistines, but it highlights David's desperation and strategic thinking. Achish, the king of Gath, likely saw David as a valuable ally against Saul, Israel's king. This period in David's life reflects a time of survival and political maneuvering, as he navigated complex relationships with both his own people and their enemies.<p><b>Each man had his family with him,</b><br>David's decision to bring the families of his men indicates a long-term stay and a need for stability and safety. This move underscores the loyalty and trust between David and his followers, as they were willing to uproot their lives to stay with him. It also reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where family units were integral to social and economic life.<p><b>and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</b><br>David's marriages to Ahinoam and Abigail are significant for several reasons. Ahinoam of Jezreel is mentioned first, suggesting her primary status among David's wives at this time. Abigail, previously the wife of Nabal, had shown wisdom and resourcefulness in her dealings with David, which likely contributed to her becoming his wife. These marriages also reflect the polygamous practices of the time, which were common among leaders for political alliances and social status. Abigail's previous marriage to Nabal, a wealthy but foolish man, and her subsequent marriage to David, a man after God's own heart, can be seen as a narrative of redemption and divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

The verse portrays real events that highlight God&#8217;s sovereignty: even in enemy territory He protects His chosen leader, sustains covenant families, and advances redemptive purposes that will culminate in David&#8217;s eventual kingship and, ultimately, in the Messiah who descends from this very line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And David dwelt with Achish at Gath.</span>--His reception by the Philistines seems to have been most kindly.
