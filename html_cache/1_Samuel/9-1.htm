This tribe held a significant position in Israel's history, known for its fierce warriors (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>) and its strategic location between the northern and southern tribes. The Benjamites were known for their skill in battle, and their territory included Jerusalem, which later became the capital under King David. The mention of a Benjamite here sets the stage for the introduction of Saul, Israel's first king, who also hailed from this tribe.<p><b>A powerful man</b><br>The term "powerful" here can be understood as a man of wealth, influence, or military prowess. In ancient Israel, power was often associated with land ownership, livestock, and the ability to lead or protect one's family and community. This description of Kish suggests that he was a man of considerable standing and respect within his tribe, which would have implications for his son Saul's future role as king.<p><b>Whose name was Kish son of Abiel</b><br>Kish is introduced as the father of Saul. The genealogy provided here establishes Saul's lineage and connects him to a family of some prominence. Abiel, Kish's father, is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible (<a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>), indicating a family with a notable history. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to legitimize a person's role or authority, and in this case, it underscores Saul's suitability for leadership.<p><b>The son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin</b><br>This detailed genealogy traces Kish's ancestry back several generations, emphasizing the importance of lineage in Israelite society. Each name in the genealogy may have held significance for the original audience, possibly indicating alliances, land ownership, or historical events associated with these ancestors. The mention of "Aphiah of Benjamin" reinforces the tribal identity and heritage, which was crucial in a time when tribal affiliations determined social and political dynamics. This lineage also highlights the providential preparation for Saul's rise to kingship, as God often worked through family lines to fulfill His purposes in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kish.htm">Kish</a></b><br>A Benjamite, father of Saul, described as a "mighty man of valor."

We are in most cases left in ignorance respecting the precise method by which God communicated with these highly-favoured men--His elect servante. The chosen Israelite whom Samuel was to anoint as the first king in Israel would meet the prophet--so said the "word of the Lord" to Samuel--on a certain day and hour, at a given place. The ninth chapter begins with a short account of the family of this man chosen for so high an office, and after a word or two of personal description, goes on to relate the circumstances under which he met Samuel. Saul, a man in the prime of manhood, distinguished among his fellows by his great stature, and for his grace and manly beauty, was the son of a noble and opulent Benjamite of Gribeah, a small city in the south of the Land of Promise.<p>The whole of this episode in our ancient book is singularly picturesque. We see the yet unproclaimed king occupied in his father's business, and throwing his whole powers into the every-day transactions of the farm on the slopes of Mount Ephraim. In a few words the historian describes how the modest and retiring Saul was roused from the quiet pastoral pursuits in which his hitherto uneventful life had been spent. The reverent, perhaps slightly reluctant, admiration with which the seer of God gazed at the future king of Israel; the prophet's significant address, the symbol gifts, the graceful hospitality, and, above all, the solemn and, no doubt, burning words of the generous old man, woke up the sleeping hero-spirit, and prepared the young Benjamite for his future mighty work. But there was no vulgar elation at the prospect which lay before him, no hurried grasping at the splendid prize which the seer told him the God of his fathers had destined for him. Quietly he took leave of the famous Samuel; the predicted signs of his coming greatness one by one were literally fulfilled; but Saul returned to the ancestral farm in the hills of Benjamin, and was subject to his father, as in old days; and when at last the public summons to the throne came to him, he seems to have accepted the great office for which he had been marked with positive reluctance and shrinking, nor does he appear materially to have altered his old simple way of living until a great national disgrace called for a devoted patriot <span class= "ital">to </span>avenge it. Then the heroic heart of the Lord's anointed awoke, and Saul, when the hour came, showed himself a king indeed.<p><span class= "bld">Kish, the son of Abiel.</span>--On comparison with the genealogical summaries given in <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm" title="Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.">1Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.">1Chronicles 7:6-8</a>, &c, the line of Samuel appears as follows:-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man... whose name was Kish.</span> The genealogy of Saul is rendered obscure by the Hebrew custom of abbreviating such records by the omission of names. The family documents were no doubt kept in full, but when transcribed, as here and in the First Book of Chronicles, only a summary is given, and as the omitted links are not always the same, great difficulty is necessarily the result. The most satisfactory genealogy is that given by Schaff from a comparison of <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35-39</a>, and is as follows: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Benjamin; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Becher; <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Aphish, perhaps same as Abiah;  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb -
