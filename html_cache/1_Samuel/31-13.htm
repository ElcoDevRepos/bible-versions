The bones symbolize the remains of the deceased, highlighting the respect and honor given to the dead in ancient Israelite culture. The retrieval of the bones signifies an act of loyalty and gratitude, as Saul had previously rescued Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11).<p><b>and buried them under the tamarisk tree</b><br>The tamarisk tree is significant as it was a common tree in the region, often associated with shade and rest. In biblical times, trees were sometimes used as landmarks or memorials. The burial under the tamarisk tree may symbolize a place of remembrance and honor. This act of burial also reflects the cultural and religious importance of proper burial practices in Israel, ensuring that the deceased were treated with dignity.<p><b>in Jabesh</b><br>Jabesh refers to Jabesh-gilead, a city east of the Jordan River. This location is significant because it was the city Saul had saved from Nahash the Ammonite, creating a bond between Saul and the people of Jabesh-gilead. Their actions in retrieving and burying Saul's bones demonstrate their loyalty and gratitude towards him.<p><b>and they fasted seven days</b><br>Fasting for seven days indicates a period of mourning and respect for the dead. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting a full period of mourning. This practice aligns with other biblical instances of mourning, such as the mourning for Jacob in <a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>.

The men of Jabesh-Gilead well remembered this peculiar fancy of their dead king, and under the waving branches of their own beautiful and famous tamarisk they tenderly laid the remains of their dead hero and his princely sons.<p>Evidently King David, at a subsequent period, fetched away these royal remains, and had them reverently interred in the family sepulchre of Kish, the father of Saul, in Zelah of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2Samuel 21:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-14.htm" title="And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.

The grateful men of Jabesh-Gilead thus paid the last honours to the fallen Saul.<p>It is probable that the Talmudic rule which enjoins strict mourning for seven days (fasting was mourning of the strictest kind) was originally based on these two historic periods of mourning recorded in the case of the great ancestor of the tribes, Jacob, and of the first King Saul, although the curious tradition preserved in the Babylonian Talmud gives a special reason for the period--seven days.
