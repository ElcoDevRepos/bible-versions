Women often led these activities, especially in victory celebrations, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a> with Miriam after the crossing of the Red Sea. The act of dancing and singing in this context signifies joy and communal participation in the triumphs of their leaders. This cultural practice highlights the role of women in expressing communal sentiments and the importance of music in Hebrew worship and celebration.<p><b>&#8220;Saul has slain his thousands,</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, was initially celebrated for his military victories and leadership. His reign began with promise, as he was chosen by God and anointed by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). The phrase acknowledges Saul's accomplishments and his role as a warrior king. However, it also subtly introduces the theme of comparison and competition between Saul and David, which becomes a central tension in the narrative. This comparison foreshadows Saul's growing jealousy and insecurity, which ultimately leads to his downfall.<p><b>and David his tens of thousands.&#8221;</b><br>David's reputation as a warrior is highlighted here, marking the beginning of his rise in popularity and favor among the people. This phrase not only celebrates David's military prowess but also signifies God's favor upon him, as seen in his victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17). The hyperbolic nature of the statement underscores David's growing influence and the divine anointing that sets him apart for future kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This comparison between Saul and David sets the stage for the unfolding narrative of David's ascent and Saul's decline, reflecting the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in raising and deposing leaders. David, as a type of Christ, prefigures the ultimate King who will reign with justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Thus in <a href="/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a> it is used of a war dance ending in a real conflict; and again (<a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) of David dancing to instruments of music, before the ark. Michal probably would not have despised David for playing an instrument of music during a religious ceremony; it was the posturing of the dance which seemed to her beneath the dignity of a king. So these women danced in alternate choruses to the beating of their tambourines and triangles. In <a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>, where, however, it is in a different conjugation, the verb is translated "to make sport." Really Samson was compelled to dance Israel's national war dance before the Philistines. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as the women danced,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1511;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;&#347;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
