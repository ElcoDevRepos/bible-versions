The practice often led to familial strife, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs like Jacob (Genesis 29-30). The presence of two wives in this narrative sets the stage for the tension and rivalry that will unfold, particularly between Hannah and Peninnah. This situation reflects the cultural and social norms of the time, where having multiple wives was sometimes seen as a means to ensure offspring and secure family lineage.<p><b>one named Hannah and the other Peninnah</b><br>Hannah, whose name means "grace" or "favor," is introduced first, possibly indicating her primary role in the narrative. Peninnah, whose name means "pearl" or "coral," is mentioned second, and her role is often seen in contrast to Hannah's. The order of their mention may suggest Hannah's prominence in the story, despite her initial lack of children. This introduction foreshadows the conflict and emotional struggle that will be central to the narrative.<p><b>And Peninnah had children</b><br>In the cultural context of ancient Israel, having children was considered a sign of God's blessing and favor. Peninnah's ability to bear children would have elevated her status within the family and society. Her fertility contrasts with Hannah's barrenness, setting up a dynamic of rivalry and tension. This situation echoes other biblical narratives where childbearing is a significant theme, such as Sarah and Hagar (Genesis 16) and Rachel and Leah (Genesis 29-30).<p><b>but Hannah had none</b><br>Hannah's barrenness is a critical element of the story, highlighting her personal anguish and societal shame. In biblical times, a woman's worth was often tied to her ability to bear children, and barrenness was seen as a misfortune or even a divine judgment. This phrase sets the stage for Hannah's deep emotional and spiritual journey, which will lead her to fervent prayer and a vow to God. Her situation parallels other biblical figures like Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel, who also experienced periods of barrenness before God's intervention. Hannah's eventual role as the mother of Samuel, a significant prophet and leader in Israel, underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and grace in overcoming human limitations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim, who is the husband of both Hannah and Peninnah.

From creation God&#8217;s pattern was one man and one woman (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), yet He permitted polygamy for a time (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that multiple marriages breed rivalry and sorrow&#8212;consider Lamech (<a href="/genesis/4-19.htm">Genesis 4:19</a>), Jacob with Leah and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30&#8211;31</a>), and Solomon&#8217;s divided heart (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3&#8211;4</a>). Elkanah&#8217;s household will prove no exception (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; God works amid human brokenness; the tension of two wives sets the stage for His gracious intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One named Hannah</b><p>&#8226; Hannah&#8217;s name is introduced first, hinting at her ultimate prominence.

Her spiritual sensitivity&#8212;seen later in her prayer (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10&#8211;11</a>)&#8212;shows that God values heart devotion above outward status (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord often begins His redemptive stories with an overlooked, faithful woman: Sarah (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>), Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>), and Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7</a>) all foreshadow Hannah&#8217;s role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The other Peninnah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;and the other Peninnah.&#8221; While little is told of her character, later verses reveal a spirit of provocation (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peninnah embodies the fleshly tendency to boast in earthly advantage (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4&#8211;7</a>). Like Hagar toward Sarah (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4&#8211;5</a>), she uses her children to belittle Hannah, exposing envy and insecurity.<p>&#8226; Her presence highlights the contrast between outward blessing and inward godliness, reminding us that &#8220;man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peninnah had children</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And Peninnah had children&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm">1 Samuel 1:2</a>b). In ancient Israel, children signified favor and future security (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Fertility gave Peninnah social leverage, yet Scripture later shows her unnamed sons fade from the narrative, while Hannah&#8217;s single boy Samuel shapes the nation (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; God often overturns human expectations: Leah&#8217;s unloved status produced Judah (<a href="/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>), and obscure Bethlehem yielded Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Hannah had none</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;&#8230;but Hannah had none.&#8221; Barrenness carried deep pain and stigma (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeated biblical accounts of infertile women&#8212;Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Manoah&#8217;s wife (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>), and Elizabeth&#8212;show that God delights to bring life where none is possible, underscoring His power and grace.<p>&#8226; Hannah&#8217;s emptiness prepares her to seek the Lord earnestly (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10&#8211;11</a>). Her story teaches that unfulfilled desires can drive us to deeper dependence, echoing Paul&#8217;s &#8220;power perfected in weakness&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm">1 Samuel 1:2</a> sets the emotional and spiritual landscape of the chapter. Elkanah&#8217;s polygamous household creates rivalry; Peninnah enjoys conventional blessing, while Hannah bears the ache of barrenness. God will use this very ache to draw Hannah into fervent prayer and to raise up Samuel, a prophet who will lead Israel into a new era. The verse reminds us that earthly advantage is not the same as divine favor, and that the Lord often begins His greatest works through those society deems empty or overlooked.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And he had two wives.</span>--The primeval Divine ordination, we know, gave its sanction alone to monogamy. The first who seems to have violated God's original ordinance appears to have been Lamech, of the family of Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-19.htm" title="And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.">Genesis 4:19</a>). The practice apparently had become general throughout the East when the Mosaic Law was formulated. In this Divine code it is noticeable that while polygamy is accepted as a custom everywhere prevailing, it is never approved. The laws of Moses--as in the case of another universally accepted practice, slavery--simply seek to restrict and limit it by wise and humane regulations. The inspired writer in this narrative of the home life of Elkanah of "Ramah of the Watchers<span class= "ital">" </span>quietly shows up the curse which almost invariably attended this miserable violation of the relations of the home life to which in the old Eden days the eternal law had given its sanction and blessing. The Old Testament Book contains many of these gently-worded but fire-tipped rebukes of sin and frailty--sins condoned and even approved by the voice of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Peninnah.</span>--Hannah signifies grace or favour, and has ever been a favourite name among the women of the East. It was the name of the Punic Queen Dido's sister, Anna. The traditional mother of the Virgin Mary was named Anna. (See <a href="/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>.) Peninnah is translated by some scholars "coral;" according to others it signifies "pearl." We have adopted the same name under the modem "Margaret."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - As a wealthy man, Elkanah <span class="cmt_word">had two wives, Hannah</span> - the Anna of Virgil, who very properly gives this name to the sister of the Phoenician Dido, the language of Phoenicia being identical with Hebrew - <span class="cmt_word">and Peninnah.</span> The word Hannah signifies <span class="accented">gracefulness</span>, while Peulnnah is the <span class="accented">red pearl</span>, translated coral in <a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, but ruby in <a href="/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>, etc. Its ruddy colour is vouched for in <a href="/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. The Hebrew names for women generally bear witness to the affection and respect felt for them; while those for men are usually religious. Though polygamy was a licence permitted to the Jews, it does not seem to have been generally indulged in, except by the kings. Here, as elsewhere, it was the ruin of family life. In Christianity it was marked for final extinction by the rule that no polygamist should be admitted even to the diaconate, and much less to higher office (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
