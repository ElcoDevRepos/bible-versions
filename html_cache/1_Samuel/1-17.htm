In the context of 1 Samuel, Eli, the high priest, uses it to reassure Hannah after her heartfelt prayer. The phrase reflects a deep-seated cultural and religious understanding of peace (shalom) as encompassing wholeness, health, and prosperity. It is reminiscent of Jesus' words in the New Testament, where He often used similar expressions to convey spiritual and physical well-being (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<p><b>Eli replied,</b><br>Eli, serving as the high priest and judge of Israel, plays a significant role in the early chapters of 1 Samuel. His position gives weight to his words, as he acts as a mediator between God and the people. Despite his earlier misunderstanding of Hannah's actions, Eli's response here shows a shift to compassion and spiritual insight. His role as a priest is crucial, as he represents the religious authority of the time, and his blessing carries the weight of divine approval.<p><b>and may the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It highlights the unique identity of God as the one true God who has chosen Israel as His people. The invocation of "the God of Israel" underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to intervene in the lives of His people. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God is often referred to in terms of His relationship with Israel (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p><b>grant the petition</b><br>The term "petition" refers to Hannah's earnest prayer for a child. In the biblical context, prayer is a vital means of communication with God, and petitions are requests made with faith and humility. The granting of petitions is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating God's responsiveness to the prayers of His people (e.g., 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the fulfillment of Hannah's request, demonstrating God's faithfulness.<p><b>you have asked of Him.</b><br>Hannah's act of asking highlights the importance of personal prayer and supplication in the believer's life. Her request is made directly to God, reflecting a personal relationship and trust in His power to act. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that God hears and answers the prayers of those who earnestly seek Him (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>). Hannah's story serves as an example of faith and perseverance in prayer, encouraging believers to bring their deepest desires before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was deeply distressed due to her barrenness.

Weak and over-indulgent to his headstrong, wicked sons, probably too self-indulgent, and a lover of ease, yet in the brief record we possess we catch eight of not a few noble thoughts and wishes: flashes of true nobility, real generosity and self-forgetfulness, of intense, devoted patriotism, light up a life which closed in failure and disaster. Here the old man is quick to see that he had been insulting a blameless woman, so at once he retracts his cruel accusation, and silently accuses himself of precipitancy and injustice in his graceful, courteous words of farewell; adding too his fatherly wish, he almost promises that what she wished so ardently should be hers.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in peace,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
