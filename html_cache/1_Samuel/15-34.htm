It was situated in the hill country of Ephraim, approximately five miles north of Jerusalem. Ramah served as a center for Samuel's prophetic activities and was where he built an altar to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). This return to Ramah signifies Samuel's withdrawal from Saul, marking a turning point in Israel's leadership. Samuel's departure underscores the severance of his relationship with Saul after Saul's disobedience to God's command regarding the Amalekites. This act of returning to Ramah can be seen as a retreat to a place of spiritual significance and reflection.<p><b>but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul</b><br>Gibeah, known as "Gibeah of Saul," was Saul's hometown and the location of his royal residence. It was located in the territory of Benjamin, about three miles north of Jerusalem. This phrase highlights the physical and symbolic separation between Samuel and Saul. Saul's return to Gibeah signifies his continued reign as king, despite God's rejection of him. Gibeah had historical significance as a place of previous moral failure in Israel (Judges 19-21), which foreshadows Saul's own failures as king. The mention of "Gibeah of Saul" emphasizes Saul's personal association with the city, marking it as a center of his kingship and a reminder of his initial anointing by Samuel. This separation between Samuel and Saul also prefigures the eventual rise of David, who would be anointed by Samuel as the new king of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was instrumental in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. In this passage, he is returning to Ramah, his hometown, after confronting Saul about his disobedience to God's command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, Saul was chosen by God but later rejected due to his disobedience. In this verse, Saul returns to his home in Gibeah after being rebuked by Samuel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, Ramah was the home of Samuel.

After the confrontation with Saul over the incomplete destruction of Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13-23</a>), Samuel&#8217;s departure signals a decisive break.<p>&#8226; By returning to Ramah, Samuel visibly steps back from public ministry to Saul. From this point forward he will grieve over the king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a>) but will no longer walk beside him.<p>&#8226; The scene echoes earlier moments when prophets distanced themselves from disobedient leaders&#8212;compare Moses separating himself from Korah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a>) or Elijah retreating after confronting Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s move also highlights that his authority remains intact even though Saul&#8217;s does not; God&#8217;s word stands, and Samuel continues to serve from a place God appointed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul</b><p>&#8226; Gibeah had become Saul&#8217;s royal base since his anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>).

Similar irony appears when the ark rests in Shiloh though glory has departed (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s isolation foreshadows his troubled future&#8212;tormented by an evil spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>), pursuing David from this same Gibeah (<a href="/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9-10</a>), and eventually dying separated from God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15-18</a>; 31:4).<p>&#8226; The split routes of prophet and king illustrate <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>: &#8220;Can two walk together without agreeing to meet?&#8221; Partnership with God&#8217;s messenger ends when obedience ends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s return to Ramah and Saul&#8217;s retreat to Gibeah mark an unmistakable parting of ways between faithful prophet and disobedient king.
