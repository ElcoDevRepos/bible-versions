Saul's use of "the LORD" indicates his acknowledgment of the God of Israel, despite his disobedience and moral decline. The invocation of a blessing here is ironic, as Saul is seeking to harm David, the Lord's anointed. This highlights the tension between Saul's words and his actions, a recurring theme in his reign. The blessing also reflects the cultural and religious practice of seeking divine favor, which was central to Israelite life.<p><b>replied Saul,</b><br>Saul's response is significant in the narrative of 1 Samuel, as it shows his continued pursuit of David, whom he sees as a threat to his throne. Saul's character is complex; he is a king chosen by God but later rejected due to his disobedience. His reply here is part of his manipulative and desperate attempts to maintain power. This moment is set against the backdrop of Saul's deteriorating mental state and his increasing paranoia about David's rise.<p><b>for you have had compassion on me.</b><br>Saul's statement of receiving compassion is ironic, as he is the one pursuing David with the intent to kill him. The people he addresses are the Ziphites, who have informed Saul of David's whereabouts. This reflects the political dynamics of the time, where local tribes and groups often aligned with the reigning king for protection or favor. Saul's use of "compassion" is manipulative, as he seeks to justify his actions and gain support. This contrasts with the true compassion shown by David, who spares Saul's life on multiple occasions, demonstrating a Christ-like forbearance and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in pursuit of David, perceiving him as a threat to his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from Saul's attempts to kill him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziphites.htm">Ziphites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ziph, who inform Saul of David's whereabouts, seeking favor with the king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziph.htm">Ziph</a></b><br>A region in the wilderness of Judah where David is hiding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom Saul invokes in his blessing to the Ziphites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_misplaced_trust.htm">The Danger of Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>Saul's reliance on the Ziphites' information shows the danger of placing trust in human schemes rather than seeking God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_irony_of_saul's_blessing.htm">The Irony of Saul's Blessing</a></b><br>Saul's invocation of God's blessing on the Ziphites is ironic, as his intentions are contrary to God's will for David.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_betrayal.htm">Responding to Betrayal</a></b><br>David's experience with the Ziphites teaches us to seek God's help and maintain integrity when betrayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_misuse_of_god's_name.htm">The Misuse of God's Name</a></b><br>Saul's use of God's name to bless the Ziphites highlights the importance of sincerity and reverence when invoking God's name.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_adversity.htm">God's Sovereignty in Adversity</a></b><br>Despite Saul's pursuit, God's plan for David prevails, reminding us of God's control over our circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_23_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 23:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Sam_23_21_show_about_Saul.htm">How does Saul's response in 1 Samuel 23:21 reveal his heart's condition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Saul_s_blessing_insight_on_God_s_will.htm">What does Saul's blessing reveal about his understanding of God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_true_intentions_in_words.htm">How can we discern true intentions behind others' words, as seen in 1 Samuel 23:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Saul_s_actions_to_his_pursuit_of_David.htm">Connect Saul's actions here with other instances of his pursuit of David.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Handling_flattery_in_spirituality.htm">How should we respond to flattery or deceitful praise in our spiritual walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_bless_David_s_betrayers_Saul.htm">Why does Saul bless those who betray David in 1 Samuel 23:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_23_21_Insights_on_Saul_s_leadership.htm">How does 1 Samuel 23:21 reflect on Saul's character and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Saul_s_reaction_in_1_Sam_23_21.htm">What does Saul's reaction in 1 Samuel 23:21 reveal about his relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_23.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_doeg_alone_kill_many_priests.htm">Are there historical or logistical issues with Doeg, a single Edomite, carrying out the massacre of so many priests (1 Samuel 21:7 -

Saul&#8217;s blessing sounds orthodox, but it is hollow because it runs counter to God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied Saul</b><p>&#8226; This sentence comes after the Ziphites offer to betray David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19-20</a>). Saul&#8217;s immediate response shows how eagerly he grasps any chance to eliminate his rival.<p>&#8226; Earlier replies expose the same pattern: &#8220;The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD&#8217;s command&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13</a>) preceded blatant disobedience; &#8220;May David be mine!&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>) masked jealousy.<p>&#8226; Each &#8220;reply&#8221; reveals a heart sliding deeper into self-deception (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Rather than repent, Saul keeps rationalizing his actions and rewriting the narrative to suit himself (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; His words underscore the danger of partial submission: acknowledging God in speech while resisting Him in practice (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you have had compassion on me.</b><p>&#8226; Saul casts himself as a victim, appealing to the Ziphites&#8217; &#8220;compassion.&#8221; He used the same tactic at Nob: &#8220;No one feels sorry for me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>).<p>&#8226; True compassion sides with righteousness; it does not enable sin (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). The Ziphites&#8217; sympathy strengthens wickedness, much like the crowd that urged Pilate to crucify Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-23.htm">Luke 23:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, David will soon display genuine compassion by sparing Saul in the cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-10.htm">1 Samuel 24:10-12</a>), embodying <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s self-pity blinds him to the grace still available if he would humble himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). Instead, he praises misplaced loyalty that advances his rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-21.htm">1 Samuel 23:21</a> unmasks a king who cloaks sin in spiritual language. Saul&#8217;s blessing sounds orthodox, yet he exploits it to pursue David. His reply exposes a heart hardened by self-interest, and his appeal to &#8220;compassion&#8221; distorts true mercy. The verse warns that invoking God&#8217;s name while opposing His purposes is hypocrisy; genuine faith joins obedient words with obedient deeds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have compassion on me.</span> There is something pitiable in Saul's answer. He had brooded over his rejection from being king, and the many indications that David was to be his successor, till he had become the prey of abject melancholy. He evidently regarded himself as a wronged and injured man, while David to his diseased imagination was ever conspiring against him and plotting his murder. With much prolixity he encourages them still to keep a close watch upon all David's movements, so as to know <span class="cmt_word">his place where his haunt is.</span> Literally, "his place where his foot will be," the place whither he goes for rest and refuge. The reason he gives for this long and close observation of David's doings is that <span class="cmt_word">it is told</span> him <span class="cmt_word">that he dealeth very subtilly</span>. That is, according to Saul's information, he behaved with the utmost prudence, ever keeping a careful look out against surprise, and using much skill to conceal his movements and to provide for his escape from danger. Finally, they are to return <span class="cmt_word">with the certainty</span> - with trustworthy and accurate information, and then Saul will gather his forces and <span class="cmt_word">search</span> David <span class="cmt_word">out throughout all the thousands of Judah</span>.
