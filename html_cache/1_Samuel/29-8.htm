Throughout his time with the Philistines, David maintained a facade of loyalty while secretly supporting Israel. This question highlights his strategic diplomacy and the tension between his true allegiance to Israel and his temporary alliance with the Philistines.<p><b>David replied.</b><br>David's response is direct and respectful, showing his diplomatic skills. His ability to communicate effectively with Achish, the Philistine king, demonstrates his leadership qualities and wisdom, which are consistent with his future role as king of Israel.<p><b>What have you found against your servant,</b><br>David refers to himself as a "servant," indicating humility and submission to Achish. This phrase underscores the trust Achish had in David, despite the suspicions of the other Philistine leaders. It also reflects the biblical theme of servanthood, which is central to the character of Jesus Christ, who came to serve rather than be served.<p><b>from the day I came to you until today,</b><br>David emphasizes his consistent behavior since joining Achish. This consistency is crucial in establishing trust and credibility. Historically, David's time with the Philistines was a period of refuge from Saul, illustrating the complex political landscape of the time.<p><b>to keep me from going along to fight</b><br>David's desire to fight alongside the Philistines is part of his ruse. His statement is a strategic move to maintain his cover, as he never intended to fight against Israel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence, as God uses David's circumstances to protect Israel.<p><b>against the enemies of my lord the king?</b><br>David refers to the Israelites as "enemies," aligning himself with Achish. This phrase is a critical part of his deception, as he never intended to harm his own people. The term "lord the king" is a respectful address to Achish, but it also foreshadows David's future as the king of Israel, who will ultimately defeat Israel's true enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently in exile and serving under Achish, the Philistine king of Gath.
