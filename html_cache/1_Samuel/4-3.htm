This return to camp signifies a moment of reflection and regrouping after a military setback. The camp was likely a temporary encampment set up for the battle, reflecting the nomadic and military lifestyle of the Israelites during this period.<p><b>the elders of Israel asked</b><br>The elders were the leaders and decision-makers among the Israelites, often responsible for guiding the people in spiritual and military matters. Their questioning indicates a search for understanding and guidance, reflecting the communal leadership structure of ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today?</b><br>This question reveals a theological perspective that attributes military outcomes to divine will. The Israelites believed that their success or failure in battle was directly related to their relationship with God. This reflects the covenantal theology where obedience to God leads to blessing, and disobedience leads to punishment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh</b><br>The ark of the covenant was a sacred chest that represented God's presence among His people. It was kept in Shiloh, a central place of worship at the time. The decision to bring the ark into battle reflects a belief in its power to ensure victory, though it also indicates a misunderstanding of the nature of God's presence and power, treating the ark as a talisman rather than a symbol of a covenant relationship.<p><b>so that it may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects a reliance on the physical presence of the ark for deliverance, rather than on God Himself. It shows a shift from faith in God to faith in religious symbols. This action can be seen as a precursor to later events where the presence of God is fully realized in Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate deliverer from spiritual enemies. The Israelites' misunderstanding here foreshadows the need for a deeper understanding of God's presence and power, which is fulfilled in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_israel.htm">The Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelite community who sought guidance and made decisions for the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during this period, often in conflict with them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The religious center of Israel at the time, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_defeat.htm">The Defeat</a></b><br>The Israelites suffered a military defeat at the hands of the Philistines, prompting them to question and seek a solution.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_trust_in_symbols.htm">Misplaced Trust in Symbols</a></b><br>The Israelites placed their trust in the Ark as a physical object rather than in God Himself.

Treating a sacred object as a battlefield charm reduces covenant faith to superstition (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;so that it may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Notice the shift: &#8220;it may go with us.&#8221; Confidence subtly transfers from the Lord Himself to the physical ark.<p>&#8226; Moses once said, &#8220;Rise up, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>); Israel now says, in effect, &#8220;Rise up, O ark.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This misplaced trust will backfire: the Philistines will capture the ark, Eli&#8217;s sons will die, and the glory will depart from Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10-11, 21</a>-22).<p>&#8226; The broader lesson echoes <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221; Reliance on symbols without obedience invites defeat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a> records leaders trying to explain defeat by prescribing a quick, outward solution: bringing the ark into battle. While they rightly acknowledge God&#8217;s sovereignty, they fail to confront their own sin and shift their trust to a sacred object rather than to the living Lord. The verse warns that ritual without repentance is powerless, and that victory comes only through heartfelt obedience to the covenant-keeping God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us?</span>--The people and the elders who, as we have seen above, had undertaken the war of liberty at the instigation or the young man of God, amazed at their defeat, were puzzled to understand why God was evidently not in their midst; they showed by their next procedure how thoroughly they had gone astray from the old pure religion.<p><span class= "bld">Let us fetch the ark of the covenant.</span>--Whether or not Samuel acquiesced in this fatal proposition we have no information. It evidently did not emanate from him. but, as we are expressly told, from the <span class= "ital">"</span>elders of the people." Probably the lesson of the first defeat had deeply impressed him, and he saw that a thorough reformation throughout the land was needed before the invisible King would again be present among the people.<p><span class= "bld">It may save us.</span>--It was a curious delusion, this baseless hope of the elders, that the unseen God was inseparably connected with that strange and beautiful symbol of His presence, with that coffer of perishable wood and metal overshadowed by the lifeless golden angels carved on the shining seat which closed this sacred Ark--that glittering mercy seat, as it was called, round which so many hallowed memories of the glory vision had gathered. Far on in the people's story, one of the greatest of Samuel's successors, Jeremiah, presses home the same truth the people were so slow in learning, when he passionately urges his Israel, "Trust ye not in lying words, saying The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are these. For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that 1 gave to your fathers, for ever and ever" (<a href="/context/jeremiah/7-4.htm" title="Trust you not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.">Jeremiah 7:4-5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-7.htm" title="Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.">Jeremiah 7:7</a>).<p>Wordsworth here, with great force, thus writes:--"Probably David remembered this history when, with a clearer faith, he refused to allow the Ark to be carried with him in his retreat before Absalom out of Jerusalem; and even when the priests had brought it forth, he commanded them to carry it back to its place, saying, 'If I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me again, and show me both it and His habitation.' (<a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm" title="And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:">2Samuel 15:25</a>.)<p>"David, without the Ark visibly present, but with the unseen help of Him who was enthroned on the mercy-seat, triumphed, and was restored to Jerusalem; but Israel, with the Ark visibly present, but without the blessing of Him whose throne the Ark was, fell before their enemies, and were deprived of the sacred symbol, which was taken by the Philistines."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the people were come into the camp.</span> Before the battle Israel had entrenched itself, so that upon its defeat it had a place capable of defence into which to retire. We find also that their communications were open, so that they could send to Shiloh. The army is called <span class="accented">the people</span> because battles were not fought in those days by men specially trained, but by all the inhabitants of the country of the proper age. The question, <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us?</span> expresses surprise. The elders had evidently expected victory, and therefore the domination of the Philistines could not have been so complete as it certainly was in the days of Samson. There must have been an intermediate period of successful warfare during which Eli had been their leader. <span class="cmt_word">Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.</span> This, the remedy suggested by the elders, was to employ their God as a talisman or charm. The ark was the symbol of Jehovah's presence among them, and of their being his especial people, and by exposing it to danger they supposed that they would compel their God to interfere in their behalf. They would have done right in appealing to their covenant relation to Jehovah; and had they repented of the sins which had grown up among them, fostered by the evil example of Eli's sons, he would have shown them mercy. But for God to have given Israel the victory because of the presence of his ark in their camp would have been to overthrow all moral government, and would have insured their spiritual ruin as inevitably as would the granting to any order of men now the power of working miracles or of infallibly declaring the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the troops</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
