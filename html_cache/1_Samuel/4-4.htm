No enemy can dethrone Him; yet He allows chastening to call His people back (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39-43</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: the King is holy, but His people treat His throne like a talisman. The scene foreshadows later glory when His presence fills the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>) and ultimately the incarnate Christ &#8220;tabernacles&#8221; among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God</b><p>&#8220;And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hophni and Phinehas had already been condemned for flagrant sin (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17, 34</a>; 3:12-14).

They dispatch men to Shiloh, seize the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts&#8212;He who reigns between the cherubim&#8212;and place it under the charge of already-doomed priests. The verse stresses God&#8217;s unassailable sovereignty, the emptiness of external religion without obedience, and the certainty that holiness prevails over human presumption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">So the people sent to Shiloh.</span>--There was, no doubt, in the minds of the elders, the memory of many a glorious victory gained in the old heroic days of Moses and Joshua in the presence of their sacred Ark; but <span class= "ital">then </span>God was with His people, and the sacred Ark of the Covenant served as a reminder of His ever-presence with them; now they had been disloyal to their unseen King, His very sanctuary had become infamous as the centre of vice, and His ministers were chiefly known as the prominent examples of covetousness and immorality, and the Ark had become only a symbol of the broken covenant.<p>It was in vain that the grand battle hymn of Israel was raised as in the old days when the Ark set forward: "Rise up, Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee" (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Were there with the ark.</span>--This Note respecting the guardians of the Ark is sufficient to account for the terrible discomfiture of Israel. The conduct and general life and example of their priestly leaders have already been indicated. What a contrast the writer of the Book bitterly puts down in his memoirs here--the glorious but now deserted earthly throne of God, and its guardians, the wicked, abandoned priests!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which dwelleth between the cherubims.</span> Literally, "which sitteth, <span class="accented">i.e. is</span> enthroned, upon the cherubim." The idea is not that of Jehovah's habitation, but of his seat in state as Israel's King. In bringing the ark they brought to the camp the throne of Jehovah, as their theocratic Ruler; but <span class="cmt_word">the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark,</span> representing the immorality of the nation, whose very priests were abandoned men. We are not to suppose that there was any fault in the manner of bringing, because it is said <span class="cmt_word">that the people sent that they might bring the ark</span> from Shiloh. Levites may have carried it, and priests with the Urim and Thummim have had the charge of every detail. But there was the ill-omened conjuncture of personal immorality with superstitious reverence for mere material symbols, and thereby the presence of the ark only insured, in the moral government of God, Israel's defeat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
