Saul's attempt to kill David with a spear is a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil and spiritual decline. The spear, a weapon of war, symbolizes Saul's intent to destroy David, whom he sees as a threat to his throne. This act of aggression is not the first; Saul had previously attempted to harm David in a similar manner (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a>). The repeated use of the spear can be seen as a symbol of Saul's persistent but ultimately futile attempts to thwart God's plan for David. Saul's actions contrast with David's earlier refusal to wear Saul's armor, highlighting the difference between Saul's reliance on physical weapons and David's trust in God.<p><b>But David eluded him and the spear struck the wall.</b><br>David's ability to elude Saul's attack demonstrates God's providential protection over him. Throughout David's life, we see a pattern of divine intervention that preserves him from harm, underscoring his role as God's chosen king. The spear striking the wall instead of David can be seen as a metaphor for the futility of opposing God's will. This incident foreshadows the many times David will escape Saul's attempts on his life, emphasizing the theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The wall, a symbol of stability and protection, ironically becomes a witness to Saul's instability and failure. This moment also prefigures the New Testament theme of Jesus eluding those who sought to harm Him until the appointed time of His crucifixion (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>).<p><b>And David fled and escaped that night.</b><br>David's flight marks the beginning of a period of exile and hardship, during which he will be refined and prepared for kingship. His escape is a pivotal moment in his life, as it sets the stage for his development as a leader and a man after God's own heart. The mention of "that night" emphasizes the urgency and danger of the situation, as well as the darkness that often accompanies trials and testing. David's experience parallels the experiences of other biblical figures, such as Moses and Jesus, who also faced periods of exile and opposition before fulfilling their divine missions. This phrase also highlights the theme of God's deliverance, as David's escape is not just a result of his own cunning, but of God's intervention and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who becomes increasingly jealous and hostile towards David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness and courage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spear.htm">Spear</a></b><br>A weapon used by Saul in his attempt to kill David, symbolizing Saul's growing animosity and irrational behavior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wall.htm">Wall</a></b><br>The physical barrier in Saul's palace where the spear was lodged, representing the danger David faced.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/escape.htm">Escape</a></b><br>David's successful evasion of Saul's attack, highlighting God's protection over him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection.htm">God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite human intentions to harm, God's plans for His anointed will prevail.

The verb used here is not that rendered <span class="accented">cast</span> in <a href="/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>, where probably we had the record of a purpose threatened, but not carried out. Here Saul actually threw his javelin at David with such violence that it was fixed into the wall. But David, though playing some instrument of music at the time, was on his guard, and slipped away. <span class="cmt_word">And David fled, and escaped that night.</span> As usual, the historian gives the ultimate results of Saul's violence first, and then returns and gives the particulars; for plainly David first went home, and it was only when he found that the house was surrounded by Saul's emissaries that he fled away to find refuge with Samuel. <span class="cmt_word">Saul also sent messengers.</span> As is often the case, this outbreak of violence on Saul's part broke down all the former restraints of upright feeling and conscience. He had lost his self-respect, was openly a murderer as regards everything but the success of his attempt, and he determined that that should not be long wanting. He sends persons, therefore, to watch David's house, with orders that when in the morning he came out, suspecting no danger, they should fall upon him and slay him. But Michal in some way or other became aware of her husband's danger. Possibly she had been at her father's house in the afternoon, and with quick observation had noticed that more than usual was going on, and seeing that her own house was the object of these preparations, had divined their intent; or possibly Jonathan may have given her information, and so she warned David of his danger. As the entrance was guarded, he was let down through a window, like St. Paul afterwards, and so began the weary life of wandering which lasted through so many troubled years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
