The guards were likely part of his inner circle, trusted men who were expected to carry out his commands without question. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where the king's word was law. The presence of guards also underscores the tension and paranoia that had gripped Saul's reign as he perceived threats to his throne.<p><b>&#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the LORD,</b><br>Saul's command to kill the priests marks a significant departure from his earlier reverence for religious figures, showing the extent of his desperation and moral decline. The priests of the LORD, serving at Nob, were descendants of Eli and part of the Levitical priesthood, which held a sacred role in Israelite worship and society. This act of violence against the priests is a grave sin, reflecting Saul's spiritual blindness and his failure to recognize the sanctity of God's anointed servants. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's kingship.<p><b>because they too sided with David.</b><br>Saul's accusation that the priests sided with David reveals his growing paranoia and fear of losing the throne. David, anointed by Samuel, was seen as a legitimate threat to Saul's rule. The priests' supposed siding with David was based on their provision of sustenance and the sword of Goliath to him, acts of hospitality rather than political alliance. This reflects Saul's inability to distinguish between genuine loyalty and perceived betrayal, further isolating him from those who could have offered wise counsel.<p><b>For they knew he was fleeing, but they did not tell me.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's claim that the priests knew of David's flight and failed to inform him underscores his sense of betrayal and the breakdown of communication within his kingdom. This reflects the broader theme of divine providence and protection over David, as God orchestrates events to preserve him despite Saul's efforts. The priests' lack of communication with Saul can also be seen as a divine intervention, protecting David from Saul's wrath and furthering God's plan for David's eventual kingship.<p><b>But the king&#8217;s servants would not lift a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.</b><br>The refusal of Saul's servants to carry out his order demonstrates a moral and spiritual resistance to committing such a heinous act. This highlights the reverence and fear of God that still existed among some of Saul's men, contrasting with Saul's own spiritual decline. Their refusal can be seen as an act of civil disobedience, prioritizing divine law over the king's command. This moment also foreshadows the eventual rejection of Saul's leadership by the people and the rise of David, a man after God's own heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_saul.htm">King Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly paranoid and sees David as a threat to his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from Saul's wrath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_of_the_lord.htm">Priests of the LORD</a></b><br>The religious leaders serving at Nob, who are accused by Saul of siding with David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards/servants_of_saul.htm">Guards/Servants of Saul</a></b><br>The king's attendants who are ordered to kill the priests but refuse to do so.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>The city of priests where the events take place, highlighting the religious significance of the location.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's disobedience to God leads to irrational decisions and moral decline.

They are still the usual attendants of any great man in the East. From long habit they were able to maintain a great speed for a long time. (See <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11</a>, where Samuel tells the children of Israel how the king of the future, whom they asked for, would take some of them to "run before his chariot." See, too, for an example of the power of running in old times, <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>, when Elijah outstripped the chariot of Ahab.)<p><span class= "bld">But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand.</span>--"And thus they were more faithful to Saul than if they had obeyed his order, which was against the commandment of the Lord, whose servant the king was no less than they."--<span class= "ital">Wordsworth.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Footmen</span>. Hebrew, "runners." They were the men who ran by the side of the king's horse or chariot as his escort (see on 1 Samuel 8:11). In constant training, they were capable of maintaining a great speed for a very long time. Here they were present at the king's council as his bodyguard, but when commanded to commit this horrid deed not one of them stirred from his place. Saul might have seen by this that he was alienating the hearts of all right minded men from him; but, unabashed, he next orders Doeg to slay the priests, and he, aided probably by his servants, <span class="cmt_word">slew in that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</span> The fact that they were thus clad in their official dress added not to the wickedness, but to the impiety of this revolting act. And, not satisfied with thus wreaking his rage on innocent men, he next destroyed the city of the priests, barbarously massacring their whole families, both men and women, children and sucklings, and even their oxen, asses, and sheep, as if Nob was a city placed under the ban. It is a deed in strange contrast with the pretended mercy that spared Agag and the best of the Amaleklte spoil on the pretext of religion. Only once before had so terrible a calamity befallen the descendants of Aaron, and that was when the Philistines destroyed Shiloh. But they were enemies, and provoked by the people bringing the ark to the battle, and even then women and children escaped. It was left to the anointed king, who had himself settled the priests at Nob and restored Jehovah's worship there, to perpetrate an act unparalleled in Jewish history for its barbarity. Nor was it an act of barbarity only, but also of insane and wanton stupidity. The heart of every thoughtful person must now have turned away in horror from the king whom they had desired; and no wonder that when, two or three years afterwards, war came Saul found himself a king without an army, and fell into that deep, despondent melancholy which drove him, in need of some human sympathy, to seek it from a reputed witch.
