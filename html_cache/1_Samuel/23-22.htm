In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/23.htm">1 Samuel 23</a>, Saul is speaking to the Ziphites, who have informed him of David's whereabouts. The need for further preparation underscores the seriousness of Saul's pursuit of David. This reflects the broader biblical theme of diligence and preparation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, which emphasizes the value of careful planning.<p><b>Investigate and watch carefully where he goes</b><br>The instruction to "investigate and watch carefully" highlights the strategic and cautious approach Saul is taking to capture David. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of vigilance and awareness, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which warns believers to be alert. The geographical context of the wilderness of Ziph, a rugged and difficult terrain, adds to the complexity of tracking David, emphasizing the need for careful observation.<p><b>and who has seen him there,</b><br>This phrase suggests the importance of eyewitness testimony in ancient times, a common practice in establishing facts and making decisions. The cultural context of the time placed significant value on personal witness accounts, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires two or three witnesses to establish a matter. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of truth and testimony.<p><b>for I am told that he is extremely cunning.</b><br>Saul acknowledges David's cunning, which is a testament to David's wisdom and resourcefulness. This recognition of David's abilities aligns with earlier biblical accounts of David's success and favor with God, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>, where David is described as prospering in all his ways because the Lord was with him. The acknowledgment of David's cunning also foreshadows his future role as a wise and strategic king, a type of Christ who embodies wisdom and discernment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul. David is known for his wisdom and cunning, as mentioned in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne. Saul's obsession with capturing David leads him to seek detailed intelligence about David's movements.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziphites.htm">Ziphites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ziph, who inform Saul of David's whereabouts. They play a role in Saul's pursuit by offering to help capture David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_ziph.htm">Wilderness of Ziph</a></b><br>A region in Judah where David is hiding. It is a rugged and remote area, providing a strategic advantage for David's evasion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Jonathan, Saul's son, is a significant figure in this account as a loyal friend to David, often providing him with support and encouragement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>Saul's request for detailed information about David's movements highlights the need for discernment in our own lives. We must be cautious about the sources of our information and the intentions behind them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite being pursued by Saul, David consistently trusts in God's protection. This teaches us to rely on God's sovereignty and faithfulness in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The Ziphites' betrayal contrasts with the support David receives from Jonathan. This reminds us of the importance of surrounding ourselves with a godly community that supports and encourages us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_adversity.htm">Wisdom in Adversity</a></b><br>David's cunning and strategic thinking in evading Saul demonstrate the value of wisdom and prudence when facing challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>Even when betrayed, David's life is preserved by God's hand.

Planning apart from God&#8217;s approval always leads to harm (<a href="/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>; <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s obsession underscores how far he has drifted from earlier humility (<a href="/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Investigate and watch carefully</b><p>&#8220;Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there&#8230;&#8221;

He wants every movement, every companion, fully documented, paralleling how the Pharisees later &#8220;watched Him closely&#8221; to trap Jesus (<a href="/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The wicked often study the righteous for downfall (<a href="/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>), yet God turns such schemes to His own ends (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s wording treats David like a criminal instead of the anointed successor, showing spiritual blindness (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> vs. 23:17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I am told that he is extremely cunning</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for I am told that he is extremely cunning.&#8221;

Jesus told His disciples to be &#8220;shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s savvy flows from reliance on the Lord&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>) rather than human craftiness.<p>&#8226; Ironically, Saul&#8217;s accusation magnifies David&#8217;s integrity; true cunning under God keeps a tender conscience while avoiding needless danger (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-12</a>; 24:11-12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a> exposes Saul&#8217;s spiraling paranoia and the lengths to which he will go to silence God&#8217;s chosen king. He orders exhaustive preparation, meticulous spying, and justifies it by exaggerating David&#8217;s &#8220;cunning.&#8221; Yet the very traits Saul fears are God-granted qualities that protect David and advance divine purposes. The verse reminds us that human schemes, however thorough, cannot overturn the Lord&#8217;s anointing; righteous wisdom outlasts unrighteous pursuit every time (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1438;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and prepare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">further.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Investigate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
