It underscores His role as the ultimate judge and lawgiver. The use of "declares" indicates a formal pronouncement, often associated with prophetic authority. This is a reminder of God's direct communication with His people, often through prophets, and His active involvement in the affairs of Israel.<p><b>&#8216;I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.</b><br>This refers to the promise made to Eli's priestly lineage, which was initially intended to be perpetual. The "house of your father" refers to the Levitical priesthood, specifically the line of Ithamar, Aaron's son. This promise is conditional, as seen in other covenants in the Bible, such as the Davidic covenant, which also had conditions of obedience (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-15</a>).<p><b>But now the LORD declares: Far be it from Me!</b><br>This indicates a revocation of the previous promise due to disobedience and unfaithfulness. It highlights the conditional nature of God's promises, which require adherence to His commands. The phrase "Far be it from Me" is a strong expression of rejection, showing that God cannot be associated with sin and unfaithfulness.<p><b>For I will honor those who honor Me,</b><br>This principle reflects the biblical theme of reciprocal honor between God and His people. It is a call to faithfulness and obedience, promising divine favor to those who respect and uphold God's commandments. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>, which speaks of honoring the Lord with one's wealth and being rewarded with abundance.<p><b>but those who despise Me will be disdained.</b><br>Despising God is equated with rejecting His authority and commands, leading to divine disfavor. This principle is consistent throughout scripture, where disobedience results in judgment and loss of blessing. The concept of disdain here is not just a passive withdrawal of favor but an active opposition, as seen in the consequences faced by Eli's house. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of blessings and curses based on covenant faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking and making a declaration about His standards of honor and disdain.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, whose family is being addressed due to their failure to honor God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli's_house.htm">Eli's House</a></b><br>Refers to Eli's descendants, who were initially promised a lasting priesthood but are now facing judgment due to their dishonor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, within which the priesthood was established to lead in worship and obedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The location where the tabernacle was situated during Eli's time, serving as the center of worship in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_honor.htm">The Principle of Honor</a></b><br>God values honor and promises to reciprocate it.

Priestly privilege brought greater accountability; when Eli&#8217;s family treated holy things with contempt, God reversed the blessing. He pledges enduring honor to anyone who honors Him, yet assures disdain for those who despise Him. The verse calls every believer to wholehearted reverence, confident that the Lord rewards faithful obedience and justly confronts persistent rebellion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">. . . but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me.</span>--But the fulfilment of the glorious and gracious promise which involved the walking of the favoured house for ever in the light of the Lord in the blessed courts of the sanctuary with no worldly cares--were they not amply provided for without sowing and reaping?--were they not invested with high honours and universal consideration?--was necessarily dependent upon those that walked, the favoured house carrying out their share of the covenant. To be honoured of God, they for their part must be His faithful servants. Now the life and conduct of the priestly house had wrought the gravest dishonour and brought the deepest shame on the worship and sanctuary of the "King in Jeshurun."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said indeed.</span> By thus acting Eli became an accomplice in the irreligion of his sons, and God therefore revokes his grant of a perpetual priesthood. The promise had been made to Aaron's family as a whole (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>), and had then been renewed to the house of Eleazar (<a href="/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>). But the house of Ithamar was now in the ascendant, probably owing to Eli's own ability, who during the anarchical times of the Judges had won for himself, first, the civil power, and then, upon some fitting opportunity, the high priesthood also, though I suppose the heads of the houses of Eleazar and Ithamar were always persons of great importance, and high priests in a certain sense. Eli had now the priority, and had he and his family proved worthy, the possession of this high station might have been confirmed to them. Like Saul in the kingdom, they proved unworthy of it, and so they lost it forever. Their names, as we have seen above, do not even occur in the genealogies. <span class="cmt_word">I said .... but now Jehovah saith.</span> Can then a promise of God be withdrawn? Yes, assuredly. Not from mankind as a whole, nor from the Church as a whole, but from each particular nation, or Church, or individual. To each separate person God's promises are conditional, and human action everywhere is a coworker with the Divine volition, though only within a limited sphere, and so as that the Divine purposes must finally be accomplished. Eli then and his sons may suffer forfeit of the promise by not fulfilling the obligations which, whether expressed or implied, are an essential condition of every promise made by God to man. But the high priesthood will continue, and will perform its allotted task of preparing for the priesthood of Christ. "Them that honour me I will honour," states one of these conditions essential on man's part to secure the fulfilment of God's promises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I did indeed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1428;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that your house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
