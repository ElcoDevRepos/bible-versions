The ascent to the city suggests a location of significance, often associated with places of worship or governance in ancient Israel. Cities were typically built on elevated ground for defense purposes. The act of climbing indicates effort and anticipation, reflecting the spiritual journey Saul is unknowingly undertaking towards his anointing as king.<p><b>they met some young women coming out to draw water</b><br>Drawing water was a daily task typically performed by women in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Wells were social gathering places, and meeting women at a well is a recurring biblical motif, seen in the stories of Rebekah (Genesis 24) and Rachel (Genesis 29). This encounter is providential, as it provides Saul with the necessary information to find Samuel. The presence of young women highlights the normalcy of the scene, yet it is a divinely orchestrated moment leading to significant events.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Is the seer here?&#8221;</b><br>The term "seer" refers to a prophet, one who receives visions from God. At this time, the term was commonly used before "prophet" became more prevalent. Saul's inquiry shows his respect and recognition of the seer's role as a spiritual guide. This question marks the beginning of Saul's direct interaction with divine guidance, as Samuel, the seer, is about to reveal God's plan for him. The use of "seer" connects to the broader biblical theme of God providing guidance and revelation through chosen individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys.

Samuel, we read, had built an altar at Ramah (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>), and probably the present sacrifice was to be offered upon it. Such altars, and the worship of the true God upon high places, were at this time recognised as right, and were, in fact, in accordance with, and were even the remains of, the old patriarchal religion. But gradually they were condemned, partly because of the glowing sanctity of the temple, but chiefly because of the tendency of religious rites celebrated in such places to degenerate into nature-worship, and orgies such as the heathen were in the habit of holding on the tops of mountains and hills. We thus find in the Bible an illustration of the principle that rites and ceremonies (as not being of the essentials of religion) may be changed, or even abolished, if they are abused, or lead on to evil consequences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were climbing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hill</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
