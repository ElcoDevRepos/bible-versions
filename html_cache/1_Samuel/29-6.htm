This summoning indicates a formal and serious conversation. David's presence in Philistine territory highlights the complex relationship between Israel and the Philistines, who were often enemies. David's alliance with Achish shows his strategic acumen and survival instincts during his fugitive years.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, you have been upright</b><br>Achish swears by the LORD, acknowledging the God of Israel, which is significant given his Philistine background. This phrase suggests that David's conduct was so exemplary that even a foreign king recognized his integrity. It reflects David's ability to maintain his character and faith even while living among those who did not share his beliefs.<p><b>and it seems right in my sight that you should march in and out with me in the army</b><br>Achish expresses his trust in David, indicating that he sees him as a reliable ally. The phrase "march in and out" suggests military campaigns, highlighting David's role as a warrior. This trust is remarkable given David's status as an Israelite, traditionally an enemy of the Philistines. It underscores David's leadership qualities and his ability to inspire confidence even among former adversaries.<p><b>because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until this day</b><br>Achish's statement of finding no fault in David is a testament to David's consistent behavior and loyalty. This echoes the biblical theme of blamelessness, which is often associated with righteousness. It also foreshadows the New Testament portrayal of Jesus Christ, who was without sin and found blameless before God and man.<p><b>But you are not good in the sight of the leaders</b><br>Despite Achish's personal approval, the Philistine leaders (the lords of the Philistines) do not trust David. This reflects the political dynamics and suspicions inherent in alliances with former enemies. It highlights the tension between personal relationships and political realities. This situation parallels the rejection Jesus faced from the religious leaders of His time, despite His innocence and the good He did.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The Philistine king of Gath who had given refuge to David when he fled from Saul.
