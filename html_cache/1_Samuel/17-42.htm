The act of looking and seeing David signifies a moment of assessment and judgment. In the context of ancient warfare, visual assessment was crucial for determining the strength and threat of an opponent. Goliath's observation of David, a young shepherd, would have seemed inconsequential compared to his own stature and experience. This moment sets the stage for the contrast between human perception and divine reality, a recurring theme in Scripture, where God often chooses the seemingly weak to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>he despised him</b><br>Goliath's disdain for David is rooted in cultural and military expectations. In the ancient Near East, warriors were esteemed for their physical prowess and battle experience. David, lacking both, was seen as unworthy of serious consideration. This contempt echoes the broader biblical narrative where God's chosen are often underestimated by the world, such as Joseph by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>) or Jesus by the religious leaders (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). Goliath's scorn also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's anointed, despite worldly rejection.<p><b>because he was just a boy</b><br>David's youth is emphasized to highlight the improbability of his victory from a human perspective. In ancient Israel, adulthood and the responsibilities of a warrior typically began at a later age, making David's presence on the battlefield unconventional. This detail underscores the theme of divine empowerment, where God equips the young and inexperienced to fulfill His purposes, as seen with other biblical figures like Samuel (1 Samuel 3) and Timothy (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p><b>ruddy and handsome</b><br>The description of David as "ruddy and handsome" serves multiple purposes. "Ruddy" likely refers to a healthy, reddish complexion, which in the cultural context could imply vitality and vigor. His appearance is noted earlier when Samuel anoints him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>), suggesting that God's choice is not based on outward appearance but on the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This physical description contrasts with Goliath's imposing figure, emphasizing that God's criteria for leadership and victory differ from human standards. Additionally, David's attractiveness prefigures the messianic king, Jesus, who, despite His humble appearance, embodies divine beauty and strength (<a href="/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, later anointed as the future king of Israel.
