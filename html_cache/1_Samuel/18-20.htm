Her affection for David contrasts with her father Saul's growing jealousy and animosity towards him. Michal's love can be seen as a divine orchestration, as David's eventual marriage to her would further entrench him within the royal family, aligning with God's plan for David to become king. This love also sets the stage for future events where Michal's loyalty to David will be tested. The mention of Michal, a woman, having agency in her feelings is notable in the cultural context of ancient Israel, where marriages were often arranged for political alliances rather than personal affection.<p><b>and when this was reported to Saul</b><br>The report to Saul about Michal's love for David is a pivotal moment. Saul, who is already aware of David's rising popularity and God's favor upon him, sees this as an opportunity to manipulate the situation to his advantage. The fact that this information is reported to Saul suggests that there were observers within the court who were aware of the dynamics between David and Saul's family, indicating a politically charged environment. This report sets in motion Saul's plan to use Michal as a pawn in his attempts to ensnare David, reflecting Saul's increasingly desperate and cunning nature.<p><b>it pleased him</b><br>Saul's pleasure at hearing of Michal's love for David is not rooted in fatherly affection or concern for his daughter's happiness. Instead, it is a strategic reaction. Saul sees Michal's love as a means to entrap David, as he later offers her in marriage with the hope that she will be a snare to him (<a href="/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a>). This pleasure is ironic, as Saul's intentions are malevolent, yet they inadvertently align with God's providential plan for David's rise to kingship. Saul's reaction highlights the theme of God's sovereignty, where even the schemes of men ultimately fulfill divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>The daughter of King Saul, who falls in love with David.

Scripture treats this as genuine, not political posturing:<p>&#8226; Her love foreshadows her later defense of David when Saul sends men to kill him (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine affection stands in stark contrast to Saul&#8217;s enmity, illustrating how God can raise allies from unexpected places (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This love also prefigures the covenantal loyalty Jonathan shows, reinforcing that David inspires true devotion in hearts God prepares (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16&#8211;17</a> with David&#8217;s descendant lineage).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when this was reported to Saul</b><p>The palace grapevine delivers the news, and Saul immediately sees opportunity:<p>&#8226; Saul has already offered his older daughter Merab as a snare (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>), revealing his manipulative mindset.<p>&#8226; Information flow within royal courts often shapes events (<a href="/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-14.htm">Daniel 2:14&#8211;16</a>), and here it feeds Saul&#8217;s scheming nature.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s knowledge of Michal&#8217;s love becomes a tool he thinks he can exploit, much like Pharaoh misread the Israelites&#8217; growth (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it pleased him</b><p>Saul&#8217;s pleasure is not sentimental; it is strategic:<p>&#8226; He hopes to use Michal to entangle David, setting a trap that will place David in lethal battles with the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; His reaction exposes the duplicity in his heart&#8212;outwardly approving, inwardly plotting (<a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment marks another step in Saul&#8217;s tragic descent, fulfilling Samuel&#8217;s earlier warning that rejecting God&#8217;s voice leads to destructive plotting (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/18-20.htm">1 Samuel 18:20</a> reveals a pivotal development: God weaves Michal&#8217;s sincere affection for David into the larger tapestry of His purposes. While Michal&#8217;s love is genuine, Saul views it as another angle for eliminating David. The verse underscores David&#8217;s rising favor, Saul&#8217;s deepening scheming, and God&#8217;s sovereign ability to turn human relationships&#8212;whether pure or twisted&#8212;toward the fulfillment of His plan to establish David&#8217;s throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And Michal Saul's daughter loved David.</span>--But the love of the younger of the two royal princesses for her father's brilliant officer gave the unhappy king a fresh excuse to expose David's life to peril, while at the same time he appeared to be endeavouring to carry out an old formal promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michal... loved David.</span> Probably there was some short lapse of time between Merab's marriage and the growth of this affection, the news of which pleased Saul. He was not an ungenerous man, and possibly may have felt ashamed at having acted so meanly by David after having exposed him to danger. And yet evil thoughts again are uppermost, and his purposes are selfish; for either way Saul will be the gainer.
