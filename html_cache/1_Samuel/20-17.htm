Jonathan, the son of King Saul, and David, the future king, had previously made a covenant of friendship (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). This reaffirmation highlights the seriousness and sacredness of their bond. In biblical times, such vows were not taken lightly, as they were seen as binding before God. The reaffirmation indicates Jonathan's commitment to David despite his father Saul's hostility. This act of reaffirmation can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teachings on the importance of keeping one's word (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p><b>out of love for him</b><br>The Hebrew word for love used here is "ahav," which denotes deep affection and loyalty. Jonathan's love for David transcends mere friendship; it is a covenantal love that reflects the selfless and sacrificial nature of true biblical love. This love is reminiscent of the love described in <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, which is patient, kind, and enduring. Jonathan's actions demonstrate a love that is willing to protect and support David, even at great personal cost.<p><b>for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself</b><br>This phrase echoes the commandment found in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "Love your neighbor as yourself," which Jesus later cites as the second greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). Jonathan's love for David is a profound example of this principle, showing a selflessness that prioritizes David's well-being over his own potential claim to the throne. This type of love is a foreshadowing of Christ's love for humanity, as Jesus taught and exemplified self-sacrificial love. Jonathan's relationship with David can be seen as a type of Christ's relationship with believers, marked by loyalty, sacrifice, and covenantal faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his deep friendship with David.

Jonathan knows Saul is hunting David; danger makes clarity essential (<a href="/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Their covenant centers on God&#8217;s faithfulness, not mere human optimism&#8212;a reminder that &#8220;two are better than one&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>) when the partnership is anchored in the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>out of love for him</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s request is love-driven, not power-driven.<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Love here is active, protective, and self-sacrificing&#8212;qualities urgently needed as Saul&#8217;s hostility escalates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for Jonathan loved David</b><p>Scripture states the fact, leaving no ambiguity.<p>&#8226;

Jonathan illustrates what selfless love looks like in real time&#8212;ceding royal rights, sharing resources, and risking reputation and life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s insistence that David reaffirm their vow highlights the sacredness of covenant, a covenant birthed in genuine, self-giving love that mirrors God&#8217;s own command to love others as ourselves.

Jonathan--looking forward with absolute certainty to the day when his persecuted friend would be on the throne, and he in his grave--dreaded for his own fatherless children the fate which too probably awaited them, it having been in all ages a common custom in the East, when the dynasty was violently changed, to put to death the children and near relations of the former king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan caused David to swear again.</span> So strong was his conviction in David's future kingdom, and his wish that there should be an unbroken bond of love between the two families, that he makes David solemnly repeat his promise. The Septuagint and Vulgate, by altering the vowels, read, "And Jonathan sware again to David." At first sight this interpretation seems most in accordance with the reason given for the renewal of the oath, namely, Jonathan's own love; but the Masoretic text agrees better with what has gone before, and with his wish that their covenant under no change of circumstances should be broken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reaffirm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
