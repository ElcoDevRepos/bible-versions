This phrase sets the scene for a confrontation, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the two nations. The Philistines were known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, including iron chariots, which made them formidable opponents. This context underscores the tension and danger Israel faced.<p><b>Samuel was offering up the burnt offering</b><br>Samuel, serving as both prophet and judge, was performing a priestly duty by offering a burnt offering. This act signifies intercession and dedication to God, seeking divine favor and intervention. The burnt offering was a common practice in Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and complete surrender to God. Samuel's role here emphasizes his spiritual leadership and the importance of seeking God's guidance in times of crisis.<p><b>But that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines</b><br>The LORD's intervention is depicted through a natural phenomenon, thunder, which in the ancient Near Eastern context often symbolized divine power and presence. This act of God demonstrates His sovereignty and ability to protect His people. Thunder as a divine weapon is also seen in other biblical accounts, such as in the battle against the Canaanites led by Joshua. This event reinforces the belief in God's active role in the affairs of Israel.<p><b>and threw them into such confusion</b><br>The confusion among the Philistines can be seen as a divine tactic to disrupt their military strategy. This mirrors other biblical instances where God confounds the enemies of Israel, such as the confusion at the Tower of Babel or the panic among the Midianites in the time of Gideon. It highlights the theme of God fighting for Israel, often turning the tide of battle through supernatural means.<p><b>that they fled before Israel</b><br>The result of God's intervention is the retreat of the Philistines, showcasing a reversal of fortunes. Despite their military strength, the Philistines are unable to withstand the power of God working on behalf of Israel. This outcome serves as a testament to the effectiveness of divine intervention and the importance of faith and obedience to God. It also foreshadows future victories where God delivers Israel from their enemies, pointing to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was instrumental in leading the Israelites back to God.

The lamb is still burning upon the altar, and Samuel still kneeling before it, when the Philistine hosts appear upon the lofty plateau just below the hill of Mizpah, and marshal themselves for battle. It seemed as if Israel's case were hopeless, and many a heart, no doubt, was bravely straggling against its fears, and scarcely could keep them down. But as the enemy drew near the electric cloud formed in the heavens, and <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah thundered with a great voice</span> (so the Hebrew) <span class="cmt_word">on that day upon the Philistines.</span> Alarmed at so unusual a phenomenon, the Philistines hesitate in their advance, and Samuel, seeing their consternation, gives the signal for the charge, and Israel, inspirited by the voice of Jehovah, rushes down the hill upon the foe. Full of enthusiasm, they forget the poorness of their weapons, and the weight of their impetuous rush breaks through the opposing line. And now a panic seizes the Philistines; they attempt no further resistance, but flee in dismay from the pursuing Israelites. Their course would lead them down a huge valley 1000 feet deep, at the bottom of which was a torrent rushing over a rocky bed; nor was their flight stayed <span class="cmt_word">until they came under Beth-car.</span> Of this place we know nothing, but probably it was a fastness where the Philistines could protect themselves from further attack. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
