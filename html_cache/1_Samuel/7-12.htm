The act of setting up a stone is a common biblical practice for marking significant events or covenants (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>). Mizpah, a site of assembly and judgment, is located in the territory of Benjamin, while Shen is less clearly identified but is believed to be nearby. This geographical setting underscores the unity and centrality of the event for the tribes of Israel. The stone serves as a physical reminder of God's intervention and faithfulness, a practice that reinforces collective memory and identity.<p><b>He named it Ebenezer,</b><br>The name "Ebenezer" means "stone of help" in Hebrew. This naming is significant as it encapsulates the essence of the event&#8212;God's assistance in Israel's victory over the Philistines. Naming places or objects to commemorate divine acts is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting the importance of remembering God's deeds (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>). The name Ebenezer also connects back to <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>, where Israel suffered defeat at the hands of the Philistines, highlighting a narrative of redemption and divine faithfulness.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Thus far the LORD has helped us.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration acknowledges God's providence and protection up to that point. It is a statement of faith and gratitude, recognizing that Israel's successes are due to divine intervention rather than human effort. The phrase "thus far" implies ongoing reliance on God, suggesting that past help is a guarantee of future assistance. This sentiment is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/124-8.htm">Psalm 124:8</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which emphasize God's continual support. Theologically, this reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God is the protector and provider. It also foreshadows the ultimate help and salvation found in Jesus Christ, who is the cornerstone of faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who played a crucial role in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ebenezer.htm">Ebenezer</a></b><br>A stone set up by Samuel as a memorial to commemorate the divine assistance provided by God to the Israelites.
