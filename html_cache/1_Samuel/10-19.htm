This rejection is significant as it marks a shift from the theocratic leadership under judges to a monarchy. The Israelites' desire for a king like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>) reflects a lack of faith in God's unique plan for them. This rejection is reminiscent of other instances where Israel turned away from God, such as the worship of the golden calf (Exodus 32).<p><b>who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions</b><br>Here, the text emphasizes God's past faithfulness and deliverance. Throughout the book of Judges, God repeatedly rescued Israel from oppression when they cried out to Him (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-18</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of God's power and mercy, contrasting with the people's current lack of trust. It underscores the theme of divine salvation, which is a precursor to the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and you have said to Him, &#8216;No, set a king over us.&#8217;</b><br>This demand for a king signifies a desire to conform to the political structures of surrounding nations, rather than relying on God's unique leadership. It reflects a deeper spiritual issue of wanting to be like the world rather than set apart. This request was foreseen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, where God provided guidelines for a king, indicating His foreknowledge of their request. The people's insistence on a human king foreshadows the coming of Jesus, the true King, who would fulfill God's perfect plan.<p><b>Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.</b><br>This command initiates the process of selecting Saul as king, which is done by casting lots (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-21</a>). The gathering of tribes and clans is reminiscent of earlier assemblies, such as the division of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18:1-10</a>). It underscores the communal aspect of Israel's identity and God's involvement in their national decisions. This moment also prefigures the gathering of all nations before Christ, the King of Kings, in the eschatological future (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.
