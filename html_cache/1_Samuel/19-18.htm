This escape is a direct result of Saul's increasing jealousy and attempts on David's life, highlighting the tension between God's anointed king and the current ruler. The act of running away signifies David's reliance on God's protection rather than human strength. This theme of divine protection is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as when Moses fled from Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>) and when Jesus escaped from those who sought to harm Him (<a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>).<p><b>And he went to Samuel at Ramah</b><br>Ramah, located in the territory of Benjamin, is significant as the hometown of the prophet Samuel. Samuel, who anointed David as king, serves as a spiritual mentor and protector. This journey to Ramah underscores David's need for guidance and support from a godly leader. The relationship between David and Samuel mirrors the mentorship seen between Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>), emphasizing the importance of spiritual leadership and discipleship.<p><b>and told him all that Saul had done to him.</b><br>David's recounting of Saul's actions to Samuel indicates a deep trust and transparency in their relationship. This confession is not just a report of events but a seeking of counsel and intercession. It reflects the biblical principle of seeking wise counsel in times of trouble (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). The narrative also foreshadows the role of Jesus as a mediator who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</b><br>Naioth, possibly a compound or settlement within Ramah, is associated with a community of prophets led by Samuel. This setting provides a sanctuary for David, where he can find spiritual refuge and renewal. The presence of a prophetic community suggests a place of divine revelation and protection, akin to the refuge cities in the Old Testament (<a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a>). The act of staying there indicates a period of rest and preparation for David, paralleling Jesus' times of retreat and prayer (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>) before significant events in His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul's attempts to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and last judge of Israel, who anointed David as king and serves as a spiritual mentor and protector.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The current king of Israel, who is consumed by jealousy and fear of David, leading him to seek David's life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>The hometown of Samuel, where David seeks refuge and counsel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/naioth.htm">Naioth</a></b><br>A place in Ramah where a community of prophets resides, and where David finds temporary safety.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_godly_counsel.htm">Seeking Godly Counsel</a></b><br>David's decision to flee to Samuel underscores the importance of seeking wise and godly counsel in times of trouble.

The exile, fleeing before his sovereign, felt that in the residence of the old seer he would be safe from all pursuit, as in a sanctuary. David's intimate connection with Samuel has been alluded to on several occasions. He stood to the old seer in the relation of a loved pupil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David...came to Samuel.</span> We have seen that there is every reason to believe that David had been taught and trained by Samuel among the sons of the prophets, and now, conscious of his innocence, he flees for refuge to his old master, trusting that Saul would reverence God's prophet, and give credence to his intercession and his pledge that David was guiltless. <span class="cmt_word">He and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</span> Rather in <span class="accented">Nevayoth</span>, as in the written text.
