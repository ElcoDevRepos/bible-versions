The cliffs create a narrow pass, which would have been a strategic military location. This setting emphasizes the danger and difficulty of Jonathan's mission. In biblical times, such terrain would have been challenging to navigate, especially during a military operation. The cliffs symbolize obstacles that require faith and courage to overcome, reflecting the spiritual battles believers face.<p><b>that Jonathan intended to cross</b><br>Jonathan, the son of King Saul, is portrayed as a man of faith and initiative. His intention to cross the pass demonstrates his courage and trust in God. This action can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced great obstacles to fulfill His mission. Jonathan's leadership contrasts with Saul's hesitance, highlighting the importance of faith-driven action. His willingness to confront the Philistines without a large army underscores the biblical theme that God often uses the few and the faithful to achieve His purposes.<p><b>to reach the Philistine outpost</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period. Their outposts were strategically placed to control key areas and intimidate the Israelites. Jonathan's goal to reach the outpost signifies a direct challenge to the enemy's stronghold, symbolizing the spiritual warfare believers engage in against the forces of darkness. This act of faith is reminiscent of other biblical figures who confronted enemy forces with God's help, such as David against Goliath.<p><b>One was named Bozez</b><br>The name Bozez means "shining" or "slippery," possibly referring to the appearance or nature of the cliff. This could indicate a difficult and treacherous path, requiring careful navigation. The name may also symbolize the deceptive allure of sin, which appears attractive but is dangerous. In a spiritual sense, believers are called to navigate the slippery paths of life with wisdom and reliance on God.<p><b>and the other Seneh</b><br>Seneh means "thorny," suggesting a rugged and inhospitable terrain. Thorns in the Bible often symbolize sin, suffering, and obstacles. This name could represent the trials and challenges that believers face in their spiritual journey. The presence of both Bozez and Seneh highlights the dual nature of the challenges Jonathan faced&#8212;both alluring and painful. This duality reflects the Christian experience of overcoming both the temptations and the hardships of life through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

Seneh.</span>--These names are of extreme antiquity. Their signification is disputed. Possibly Bozez signifies "shining," and Seneh "the accacia." These rocks have been identified by modern travellers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Between the passages.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the passes. <span class="cmt_word">A sharp rock.</span> Literally, "a tooth of rock." Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:112) says, "The site of the Philistine camp at Michmash, which Jonathan and his armour bearer attacked, is very minutely described by Josephus. It was, he says, a precipice with three tops, ending in a long, sharp tongue, and protected by surrounding cliffs. Exactly such a natural fortress exists immediately east of the village of Michmash, and is still called 'the fort' by the peasantry. It is a ridge rising in three rounded knolls above a perpendicular crag, ending in a narrow tongue to the east, with cliffs below, and having an open valley behind it, and a saddle towards the west, on which Michmash itself is situate. Opposite this fortress, on the south, there is a crag of equal height, and seemingly impassable. Thus the description of the Old Testament is fully borne out - 'a sharp rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other.' The southern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Seneh</span>, or 'the acacia,' and the same name still applies to the modern valley, due to the acacia trees which dot its course. The northern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Bozez</span>, or 'shining,' and the true explanation of the name only presents itself on the spot." Conder then describes how, "treading perhaps almost in the steps of Jonathan, after arriving on the brink of the chasm, or defile of Michmash, they were able to descend Seneh, even with horses and mules. "I noticed," he says, "that the dip of the strata down eastward gave hopes that by one of the long ledges we might be able to slide, as it were, towards the bottom. It is not likely that horses had ever before been led along this ledge, or will perhaps ever again cross the pathless chasm, but it was just possible, and by jumping them down one or two steps some three feet high, we succeeded in making the passage.... Though we got down Seneh, we did not attempt to climb up Bozez .... Horses could scarcely find a footing anywhere on the sides of the northern precipice; but judging from the descent, it seems possible that Jonathan, with immense labour, could have 'climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him' (ver. 13). That a man exhausted by such an effort could have fought successfully on arriving at the top can only be accounted for on the supposition of a sudden panic among the Philistines, when they found the enemy actually within their apparently impregnable fortress." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now there were cliffs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8127.htm">Strong's 8127: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tooth,   ivory, a cliff</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on both sides</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1433;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m, Article &#124;
