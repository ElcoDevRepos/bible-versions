This indicates divine authority and the seriousness of the message. Eli, the high priest, is the recipient, highlighting his spiritual responsibility. Prophets were common in Israel to guide and correct leaders, as seen with Nathan and David (2 Samuel 12).<p><b>This is what the LORD says</b><br>The phrase signifies a direct message from God, emphasizing its importance and authenticity. It is a common prophetic introduction, seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the messages of Isaiah and Jeremiah. It underscores the divine origin of the message and the expectation of obedience.<p><b>Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father&#8217;s house</b><br>This refers to God's self-revelation to the house of Levi, from which Eli descends. It recalls God's covenantal relationship with Israel and the priestly duties assigned to Levi's descendants. The clarity of God's revelation implies that Eli's household had a clear understanding of their responsibilities and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh&#8217;s house?</b><br>This alludes to the time of Israel's bondage in Egypt, a foundational period in Israelite history. It reminds Eli of God's deliverance and the establishment of the Levitical priesthood during the Exodus.

The "house of thy father" refers to the house of Aaron, the first high priest, from whom, through Ithamar, the fourth son of Aaron, Eli was descended.<p>The Talmud has a beautiful note on this passage:--Rabbi Shimon ben Yochi said, "Come and see how beloved Israel is by the Holy One! Blessed be He! Wherever they are banished, there the Shekinah is with them; as it is said (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm" title="And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?">1Samuel 2:27</a>): 'Did I (God) plainly appear unto the house of thy fathers when they were in Egypt?' &c. When they were banished to Babylon, the Shekinah was with them; as it is said (<a href="/isaiah/43-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.">Isaiah 43:14</a>): 'For your sakes was I sent to Babylon.' And when they will be redeemed the Shekinah will be with them; as it is said (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm" title="That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>): 'Then the Lord thy God will return with thy captivity;' it is not said, He will cause to return (transitively), but He will return (intransitively)."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Meguillah, </span>fol. 29, Colossians 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came a man of God.</span> The title <span class="accented">man of God</span> is the usual appellation of a prophet in the books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, and as such is applied by Manoah to the angel who appeared to him (<a href="/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6, 8</a>). Though the recorded interpositions of the Deity in those times were generally by angels, still the readiness with which Manoah gave his visitant this title makes it probable that prophets did appear from time to time; and the mission of one, though, as here, without a name, is recorded in <a href="/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8</a>. As regards the date of this visitation of the man of God, we find that Eli was ninety-eight years of age when the ark was captured (<a href="/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>). At that time Samuel was not merely a man, but one whose reputation was established throughout the whole land, and who was probably regarded not merely as a prophet, but as Eli's successor in the office of judge (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19, 20</a>). But Eli was "very old" (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>) when he rebuked his sons, probably between seventy and eighty, for Samuel is then called a child (ver. 26); whereas he can scarcely have been much less than thirty years of age when the Philistines destroyed Shiloh. In <a href="/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1-3</a>, when the misconduct of Samuel's own sons led to the revival of the agitation for a king, he is himself described as already "old;" but as he lived on till nearly the end of Saul s reign, he could not at that time have been much <span class="accented">more</span> than sixty. Even when God spake by him to Eli he is still described as a boy, <span class="accented">na'ar</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>), though the higher position to which he had attained, as is proved by his duties, would lead to the conclusion that he was then verging on manhood. As some time would naturally elapse between two such solemn warnings, we may feel sure that the visit of the man of God occurred shortly after Samuel s dedication. Then, as Eli neglected the warning, and the wickedness of his sons grew more inveterate, some eight or ten years afterwards the warning was repeated in sharper tones by the voice of his own youthful attendant. Meanwhile Eli seems himself to have grown in personal piety, but he could do nothing now for his sons. Past eighty years of age, the time of activity had gone by, and resignation was the sole virtue that was left for him to practise. And so the warning given by the mouth of Samuel is stern and final. Ten or fifteen more years must elapse before the ruin came. But the gloom was deepening; the Philistines were increasing in power, and the valour of Israel was decaying as its morality declined; then there was a short violent crash, and the house of Eli met its doom. The prophet begins by enumerating Jehovah's mercies to "the house of thy father," that is, the whole family of Aaron, in selecting them for the priesthood (on the choice of the house of Aaron, see <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 29</a>.), and in richly endowing the office with so large a portion of every sacrifice. These portions are termed literally <span class="accented">firings</span>, or fire sacrifices, but the term soon became general, and in <a href="/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7, 9</a> is applied even to the shew bread. Added then to the tithes, and to the cities with their suburbs given them to inhabit, this share of every sacrifice gave the house of Aaron great wealth, and with it they had also high rank. There was no one above them in Israel except the kings. In Sparta we find that one of the endowments of the kings was the skins of animals offered in sacrifice (Herod., 6:56). Why then do Eli and his sons, who benefit so greatly by them, "kick at Jehovah's sacrifices and offerings?" The word is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, and refers to the efforts of a pampered steer violently to shake off the yoke. Eli's sons treat the ordinances which have raised them to rank, and given them wealth and power, as if they were an injury and wrong. And Eli, instead of removing them from the office which they disgraced, preferred the ties of relationship to his duty to God and the moral welfare of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
