Forests in ancient Israel were not as dense as modern ones but provided cover and resources. This setting is significant as it contrasts with the open battlefields and highlights the natural resources available to the Israelites.<p><b>and saw the flowing honey</b><br>Honey in ancient Israel was a symbol of abundance and prosperity, often associated with the Promised Land described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The presence of honey in the forest indicates the richness of the land and God's provision, even in times of conflict. The honey likely came from wild bees, which were common in the region.<p><b>not one of them put his hand to his mouth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the discipline and obedience of the Israelite soldiers. Despite their hunger and the natural temptation to eat, they refrained from doing so. This act of self-control is significant in the context of the oath imposed by King Saul, which prohibited eating until evening.<p><b>because they feared the oath</b><br>The oath refers to King Saul's command that no one should eat until evening, under penalty of a curse (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>). This oath was intended to motivate the troops to focus on defeating the Philistines. The fear of the oath indicates the soldiers' respect for Saul's authority and the seriousness with which they regarded oaths and curses in their culture. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power of words and vows, as seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>- The son of King Saul, who unknowingly breaks his father's oath by eating honey, demonstrating his bravery and initiative in the battle against the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>- The first king of Israel, who made a rash oath that his troops should not eat until evening, which led to unnecessary hardship for his men.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_troops.htm">The Troops</a></b><br>- The Israelite soldiers who were fighting under King Saul's command and were affected by his oath, leading to their exhaustion and fear.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forest.htm">The Forest</a></b><br>- The location where the honey was found, symbolizing God's provision and the natural abundance that was available to the troops.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oath.htm">The Oath</a></b><br>- A vow made by Saul that cursed any man who ate food before evening, which was intended to motivate the troops but instead caused them to fear and suffer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rash_decisions.htm">The Danger of Rash Decisions</a></b><br>Saul's impulsive oath demonstrates the potential harm of making decisions without seeking God's guidance.

They now push into a wooded area&#8212;dense enough that sunlight is filtered, quiet enough that every rustle is heard.<p>&#8226; The forest scene underscores how near relief appears while the men are still under strain, mirroring other moments when God&#8217;s people faced severe testing just as provision was in sight (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-4</a>; <a href="/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s earlier command has already framed their mindset: &#8220;Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>). The setting becomes the stage for that oath to be tested.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seeing the flowing honey</b><p>&#8220;At the entrance to the forest they saw the flow of honey&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Honey, naturally seeping from combs in hollow trees, is a vivid symbol of God-given abundance&#8212;what the promised land was famed for (&#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey,&#8221; <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This flow is no mirage. Like Samson scooping honey from the lion&#8217;s carcass (<a href="/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8-9</a>) or Jonathan&#8217;s later taste (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>), it signals immediate energy and pleasure&#8212;exactly what the weary troops crave.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs honey with sweetness that refreshes both body and soul (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13-14</a>). The visual here heightens the test: will they reach for a gift that seems obviously supplied by God, or will they honor the restriction that still binds them?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not one of them put his hand to his mouth</b><p>Though starving, &#8220;not one of them put his hand to his mouth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their self-restraint is remarkable: the tired, hungry, battle-worn soldiers refrain from the easiest, most tempting relief.<p>&#8226; Compare Esau trading his birthright for stew (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>) or the disciples plucking grain on the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-23.htm">Mark 2:23-24</a>). In contrast, these men choose restraint over appetite.<p>&#8226; This moment exposes the clash between physical need and spiritual obedience, echoing Moses&#8217; reminder that &#8220;man does not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because they feared the oath</b><p>&#8220;Because they feared the oath&#8221; explains everything.<p>&#8226; Oaths carried weight: breaking one invited divine judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s vow, though rash, is still viewed as binding. The soldiers&#8217; fear is not merely of their king&#8217;s anger but of God who stands behind covenant words (<a href="/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their reverence contrasts with Saul&#8217;s own later carelessness toward the Lord&#8217;s commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). Obedience, even when leadership is flawed, is portrayed as the safer, holier path (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a> pictures hungry troops discovering an abundance of honey yet refusing to eat. The scene highlights the tension between immediate physical relief and faithful submission to a spoken oath. God&#8217;s provision is palpable, but so is the seriousness of covenant words. The soldiers&#8217; restraint marks a moment of collective obedience, underscoring that honoring God-ordained authority and kept promises outweigh satisfying legitimate bodily cravings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Behold, the honey dropped.</span>--Literally,. <span class= "ital">Behold, a stream of honey.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The honey dropped.</span> More correctly, "Behold, a stream (or a flowing) of honey." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when [they]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
