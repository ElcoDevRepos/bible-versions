In the ancient Near Eastern context, a name represented one's identity and reputation. God's name is associated with His holiness, faithfulness, and power. Throughout the Bible, God's actions are often tied to the sanctity of His name (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>). The preservation of His name's honor is a recurring theme, as seen in the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be Your name" (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>).<p><b>the LORD will not abandon His people</b><br>This assurance reflects God's covenant faithfulness. Historically, Israel had experienced God's deliverance from Egypt and His guidance through the wilderness. Despite their repeated disobedience, God remained committed to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This promise of not abandoning His people is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus assures His followers of His continual presence (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>because He was pleased to make you His own</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereign choice and grace. Israel's selection as God's people was not based on their merit but on God's love and purpose (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). This concept of divine election is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are described as chosen by God (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>).
