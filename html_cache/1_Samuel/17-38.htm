Saul's tunic represents the king's authority and status, suggesting an attempt to transfer some of his own power and protection to David. This act can be seen as symbolic of Saul's recognition of David's potential, even if reluctantly. The tunic, a common garment of the time, signifies the personal nature of this gesture, as clothing was often custom-made and personal.<p><b>put a bronze helmet on his head</b><br>The bronze helmet is a piece of military equipment that signifies protection and readiness for battle. Bronze was a common material for armor in the ancient Near East, known for its durability. This detail underscores the seriousness of the impending confrontation with Goliath, as helmets were crucial for protecting warriors in combat. The use of bronze also connects to the Philistines, who were known for their advanced metallurgy.<p><b>and dressed him in armor</b><br>The armor represents the conventional means of warfare and protection. Saul's attempt to dress David in armor reflects the human tendency to rely on physical strength and traditional methods in battle. However, this also foreshadows David's rejection of such means, as he ultimately chooses to face Goliath with faith and a sling. This moment prefigures the New Testament theme of spiritual armor, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are encouraged to put on the armor of God rather than rely on worldly defenses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

&#8220;Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic&#8221; highlights a remarkable exchange: the reigning king temporarily shares his personal garment with a shepherd boy.<p>&#8226; Practical dimension: Saul intends to equip David like any other soldier; a tunic was the base layer for armor.<p>&#8226; Symbolic dimension:<p>&#8211; Royal identification&#8212;similar moments include Pharaoh placing his signet ring and linen garments on Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>).<p>&#8211; Recognition of calling&#8212;Jonathan will soon give David his robe and weapons as a covenant sign (<a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Contrast with Saul&#8217;s earlier torn robe in <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>, which pictured the kingdom being removed from him.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty glimmers here: even before David officially receives the throne, Saul&#8217;s own hands acknowledge David&#8217;s future role by covering him with kingly attire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put a bronze helmet on his head</b><p>&#8226; Helmets were uncommon in Israel&#8217;s ranks, yet Philistine champions like Goliath used bronze (<a href="/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>). By choosing bronze, Saul mimics enemy technology, seeking human parity.<p>&#8226; Bronze in Scripture often hints at judgment or steadfastness (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>); Saul&#8217;s gesture attempts to provide earthly security, but it cannot substitute for divine protection.<p>&#8226; A deeper layer: God later speaks of the &#8220;helmet of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>).

Saul outfits David with royal garments, a bronze helmet, and full armor, symbolizing the best human strategy can offer. Yet the very next verse shows David discarding it all, proving that victory over Goliath&#8212;and every giant&#8212;rests not in borrowed strength but in personal trust in the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">And Saul armed David with his armour.</span>--But the king was determined to omit no earthly means of securing victory to his young champion, and we read how he made him try on his own various pieces of fighting array, doubtless the best-tempered and costliest that the camp of Israel possessed. The word rendered "his armour" literally signifies <span class= "ital">his garments, </span>that is, the dress worn beneath the mail. Upon this was buckled on the heavy metal armour suit, with the great fighting sword and the royal helm. It is not necessary to suppose David was at all of the same proportions as Saul, for much of the dress could have been speedily adjusted to the requirements of one slighter and shorter than the king; besides, the result shows they were, in spite of alteration, far too heavy and cumbersome. <span class= "ital">"</span>I cannot go with these," simply said the brave boy, his purpose, however, of meeting the Philistine giant quite unshaken, though he found his comparatively weak person unable to bear the weight of the king's panoply or to wield his arms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul armed David with his armour.</span> Rather, "Saul clad David in his war dress." The word does not mean <span class="accented">arms</span>, either offensive or defensive; for in <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>, where it is rendered "clothes," we read of its being rent. It occurs again in <a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>, and is there rendered "garments." Strictly it was the soldier's coat, worn under his armour, and girt close to the body by the sword belt. It does not follow that David was as tall as Saul because he thus put on his military coat; for it would be adjusted to the body by the belt, and its length was not a matter of much consequence. When, then, it is said that <span class="cmt_word">David girded his sword upon his armour,</span> it means upon this coat, though the corselet of mail would also be worn over it. He assayed to go. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he made an attempt at going, took a short walk thus arrayed, making trial all the while of his equipments; and he found them so cumbrous that he felt that he would have no chance against the Philistine except as a light-armed soldier. The agility of his movements would then make him a match for one so heavily overweighted as Goliath. Wearing, therefore, only his shepherd's dress, armed only with a sling, David descended into the ravine which separated the two armies, chose there five pebbles, and, clambering up the other side, advanced towards the Philistine. For <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> the Hebrew has "torrent bed." Condor speaks of a torrent flowing through the ravine (see on ver. 2).
