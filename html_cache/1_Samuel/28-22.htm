The speaker, the woman of Endor, addresses Saul with respect, acknowledging her position as a servant. This reflects the hierarchical social structure of the time, where individuals often identified themselves in relation to others, especially those of higher status. The plea for Saul to listen indicates urgency and concern, highlighting the gravity of the situation Saul finds himself in.<p><b>and let me set a morsel of bread before you</b><br>Offering bread is a gesture of hospitality and care, common in the ancient Near East. Bread was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and life. The act of setting bread before someone was a sign of goodwill and an invitation to fellowship. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/28.htm">1 Samuel 28</a>, this gesture is significant as it comes from a woman who was initially wary of Saul, showing a shift from fear to compassion.<p><b>so you may eat and have the strength</b><br>Eating for strength underscores the physical and spiritual nourishment needed for the journey ahead. In biblical times, meals were not just for sustenance but also for strengthening bonds and preparing for tasks. This phrase can be connected to other scriptures where food is provided for strength, such as Elijah being fed by the ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>) or Jesus feeding the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), symbolizing divine provision and care.<p><b>to go on your way.</b><br>The phrase "to go on your way" implies a continuation of a journey or mission. In the context of Saul's impending fate, it carries a somber tone, as his way leads to his downfall. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the journey of life and the choices that define one's path. It also echoes the idea of divine direction and the consequences of straying from God's guidance, as seen throughout the narrative of Saul's kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of desperation and fear as he faces the Philistine army.

Even in Saul&#8217;s darkest hour, physical provision testifies to the Creator&#8217;s ongoing mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so you may eat</b><p>&#8226; Eating restores strength but also signals fellowship. Though Saul sought forbidden counsel (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10&#8211;12</a>), the act of sharing food echoes God&#8217;s constant invitation to return (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast: David refused to eat while his child was dying (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16&#8211;17</a>), showing that refusing bread can mark grief or repentance; here, Saul&#8217;s reluctance (v. 23) highlights despair rather than humble surrender.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have the strength</b><p>&#8226; Physical stamina is tied to spiritual readiness. Jonathan earlier warned, &#8220;My father has made trouble for the land&#8230; if only the troops had eaten today&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-29.htm">1 Samuel 14:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches that neglecting God-given means of refreshment weakens resolve (<a href="/1_kings/19-7.htm">1 Kings 19:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>). Saul must regain strength, yet his spiritual weakness remains unaddressed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go on your way.</b><p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s &#8220;way&#8221; leads inexorably toward battle and death (<a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1&#8211;6</a>). The phrase recalls God&#8217;s repeated charge to walk &#8220;in all His ways&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>), a path Saul abandoned.<p>&#8226; Like Judas leaving the upper room (<a href="/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a>), Saul departs into the night, strengthened in body yet distant from the Lord in heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/1_samuel/28-22.htm">1 Samuel 28:22</a> layers compassion over tragedy. The servant woman offers bread, mirroring God&#8217;s persistent grace, while Saul&#8217;s acceptance supplies only temporary vigor for a doomed course. The verse highlights two truths: God&#8217;s care remains available even to the wayward, and physical provision cannot replace the spiritual obedience that leads to life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
