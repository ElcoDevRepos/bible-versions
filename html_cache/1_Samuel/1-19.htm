Rising early to worship signifies their earnestness and dedication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, morning was often a time for prayer and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, which emphasizes seeking God in the morning. Worship before the LORD indicates their acknowledgment of Yahweh as the one true God, contrasting with the idolatrous practices surrounding them. This act of worship is a response to Hannah's prayer and vow made in the temple, showing their faithfulness and gratitude.<p><b>and then they returned home to Ramah</b><br>Ramah, located in the hill country of Ephraim, was the hometown of Elkanah and Hannah. It is significant as the birthplace and home of the prophet Samuel. The return to Ramah signifies a transition from the sacred space of Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located, back to their daily lives. This journey underscores the faith journey of believers, moving from moments of intense spiritual experience back to everyday life, yet carrying the impact of those experiences with them.<p><b>And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah</b><br>This phrase indicates the fulfillment of marital intimacy, which in the biblical context is seen as a blessing and a means of fulfilling God's command to be fruitful and multiply (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The act of Elkanah having relations with Hannah is significant because it follows her vow and prayer for a child. It demonstrates the natural means through which God often fulfills His promises, using human actions to bring about His divine purposes.<p><b>and the LORD remembered her</b><br>The phrase "the LORD remembered her" is a powerful expression of divine intervention and faithfulness. In biblical terms, when God "remembers" someone, it signifies His active engagement and fulfillment of His promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a> when God remembered Noah. This remembrance is not about recalling forgotten information but about acting on behalf of His people. For Hannah, it meant the granting of her heartfelt desire for a child, which would lead to the birth of Samuel, a pivotal figure in Israel's history. This act of remembrance also foreshadows God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises through Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A devout man from the tribe of Ephraim, Elkanah is the husband of Hannah and Peninnah.
