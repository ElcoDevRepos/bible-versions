The Philistine, Goliath, represents the formidable enemy of Israel, both physically and spiritually. His approach signifies the growing threat against God's people. In the broader biblical narrative, the Philistines were a constant adversary to Israel, often symbolizing the forces of the world opposed to God's covenant people. This moment is a pivotal point in the story, highlighting the courage and faith of David, who stands firm despite the intimidating presence of Goliath. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith, where David's reliance on God contrasts with the Philistine's reliance on physical might.<p><b>with his shield-bearer before him</b><br>The presence of a shield-bearer indicates the level of Goliath's status and the seriousness of the battle. In ancient warfare, a shield-bearer was an attendant who carried a large shield to protect the warrior, allowing the fighter to focus on offense. This detail emphasizes Goliath's formidable nature and the military practices of the time. It also underscores the disparity between Goliath and David, as David approaches without such protection, relying instead on his faith in God. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the victory of faith over physical strength, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture. The shield-bearer, though a minor character, highlights the contrast between human reliance on armor and God's provision for those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistine.htm">The Philistine (Goliath)</a></b><br>A giant warrior from Gath, representing the Philistine army.
