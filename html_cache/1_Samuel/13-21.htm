The term "pim" refers to a weight measure used in the context of commerce, roughly equivalent to two-thirds of a shekel. This indicates the cost imposed by the Philistines for sharpening agricultural tools, which were essential for farming. The Philistines' control over metalworking and their imposition of charges for tool maintenance highlight their dominance and the subjugation of the Israelites. This situation underscores the broader theme of Israel's struggle for independence and self-sufficiency during the time of Saul. The mention of specific tools like the plowshare and mattock emphasizes the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites and their dependence on agriculture for survival.<p><b>a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe</b><br>The reference to "a third of a shekel" further illustrates the economic burden placed on the Israelites by the Philistines. The shekel was a standard unit of weight and currency in the ancient Near East. By controlling the sharpening of essential tools like the pitchfork and axe, the Philistines maintained economic leverage over the Israelites. This control extended beyond mere military dominance, affecting daily life and labor. The pitchfork and axe were crucial for both agriculture and construction, indicating that the Philistines' influence permeated various aspects of Israelite society. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of oppression and the need for deliverance, which is a recurring motif throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad</b><br>The oxgoad was a tool used to drive oxen, essential for plowing fields. The mention of a charge for "repointing" suggests the maintenance of this tool was also under Philistine control. The economic exploitation through such charges highlights the Israelites' vulnerability and dependence on their oppressors. This scenario is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God's people face oppression and seek deliverance. The oxgoad itself is a symbol of labor and productivity, and its mention here underscores the Philistines' strategic control over the Israelites' ability to sustain themselves. This passage, while detailing a specific historical and economic situation, also points to the broader spiritual struggle and the need for divine intervention, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is leading the Israelites during this time of conflict with the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people who were often in conflict with Israel.

The enemy profited every time an Israelite prepared his fields (compare <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>, where Canaanite oppression also drained Israel&#8217;s resources).<p>&#8226; This first price tag highlights how thoroughly the Philistines intended to weaken Israel: even plowshares and mattocks&#8212;basic tools of provision&#8212;were taxed. When God&#8217;s people let the world dull their edge, they soon pay for what ought to be theirs by right (see <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;48</a> for the warning that disobedience leads to serving enemies &#8220;in hunger and thirst&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Yet the Lord would later turn plowshares into swords under King David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>), showing that He can reverse any disadvantage when His people trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe</b><p>&#8226; The fee stays constant, but the tools shift from tilling soil to handling harvest. The Philistines taxed every stage of productivity&#8212;sowing, gathering, and building&#8212;ensuring Israel never accumulated strength (contrast the blessing of free, fruitful labor in <a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Pitchforks and axes also hint at defense: an axe&#8217;s edge can become a weapon (compare <a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a>, where &#8220;not a shield or spear was seen&#8221;). By keeping blades dull unless paid for, the enemy limited Israel&#8217;s military potential.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, when believers neglect the sharpening of their God-given gifts, effectiveness is blunted (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>). The passage reminds us to keep a keen edge through the Word and fellowship, not by relying on worldly systems.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad</b><p>&#8226; Even the cattle driver&#8217;s implement came under the tax. An oxgoad steers the animal that pulls the plow; so, guidance itself was taxed. The oppression touched guidance, labor, and harvest&#8212;total control. (See <a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>, where only Saul and Jonathan had swords; everyone else worked with these very tools.)<p>&#8226; God later used an oxgoad in Shamgar&#8217;s hand to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), proving He can turn the simplest object into a mighty weapon when faith is present.<p>&#8226; For believers, the passage urges vigilance: keep your &#8220;oxgoad&#8221; sharp&#8212;the Scriptures that prod and direct (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>). Don&#8217;t concede that edge to the enemy by neglect or compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> records a real, calculated oppression: the Philistines charged stiff fees for sharpening every vital tool, sapping Israel&#8217;s strength from field to battlefield. The verse underscores how bondage starts when God&#8217;s people surrender their edge&#8212;literal or spiritual&#8212;to an ungodly power. Yet the broader narrative shows the Lord ready to overturn such bondage when His people rely on Him alone, keeping their faith&#8212;and their tools&#8212;sharp.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Yet they had a file for the mattocks . . .</span>--This translation, the sense of which is not very clear, is supported by the Targum and by many of the great Hebrew commentators--Rashi, for instance. Gesenius and the majority of modern scholars, however, render the word in the original translated "file" (<span class= "ital">p'tsirah</span>) by "bluntness." The passage then would run: "And there was bluntness (or dulness) of edge to the mattocks; "or," so that bluntness of the edges occurred to the mattocks." "The forks" were probably an instrument with three prongs, like our trident.<p><span class= "bld">And to sharpen the goads.</span>--The words from "and there was bluntness," &c. (English Version, "they had a file"), down to "axes," form a parenthesis.<p>"This parenthesis indicates that the result of the burthensome necessity of going to the Philistines was that many tools became useless by dulness, so that even these poorer sort of arms did the Israelites not much service at the breaking out of the war."--Bunsen.<p>The LXX. read this 21st verse with considerable changes: "And the vintage was ready to be gathered, and the tools were three shekels to the tooth to sharpen], and to the axe and to the scythe there was the same rate" (or, as the Greek has been rendered," tools cost three shekels apiece [to sharpen]").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A file.</span> Margin, <span class="accented">a file with mouths.</span> The word only occurs here, and is translated a file on the authority of Rashi. Almost all modern commentators agree that it means <span class="accented">bluntness</span>, and that this verse should be joined on to the preceding, and the two be translated, "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his sickle, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his mattock, whenever the edges of the mattocks, and the ploughshares, and the forks, and the axes were blunt, and also to set (so the margin rightly) the goads." The Israelites were thus in a state of complete dependence upon the Philistines, even for carrying on their agriculture, and probably retained only the hill country, while their enemies were masters of the plains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The charge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
