In the ancient Near Eastern context, a prophet's presence with a king symbolized divine approval and guidance. Samuel's decision not to accompany Saul underscores the withdrawal of God's favor. This moment marks a pivotal point in Israel's history, as the prophet's actions demonstrate the consequences of rejecting God's commands.<p><b>&#8220;For you have rejected the word of the LORD,&#8221;</b><br>Saul's rejection of God's word refers to his failure to completely destroy the Amalekites and their possessions as commanded in <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>. This disobedience is not merely a personal failure but a direct violation of a divine command. In biblical terms, rejecting God's word is equated with rejecting God Himself. This theme is echoed throughout Scripture, where obedience to God's word is paramount (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>, <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;and He has rejected you as king over Israel.&#8221;</b><br>The rejection of Saul as king is a divine judgment that reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. Saul's kingship was conditional upon his obedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14-15</a>). His failure to adhere to God's command results in the loss of his divine mandate to rule. This rejection foreshadows the rise of David, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), and serves as a typology of Christ, the ultimate King who perfectly fulfills God's will. Saul's rejection also highlights the biblical principle that leadership is a stewardship from God, contingent upon faithfulness to His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

It was only, as C. a Lapide forcibly urges, a fear on the part of the king, of losing the kingdom and of incurring public disgrace. The prophet for reply again repeats the terrible Divine sentence of rejection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27, 28.</span> - At first the prophet refuses the king's request. Saul had dishonoured God, and, therefore, had no claim to public homage from God's minister. He turns, therefore, to go away, and Saul in his eagerness seizes hold of Samuel's <span class="cmt_word">mantle</span>. The A.V. is very careless about the exact rendering of words of this description, and seems guided in its choice of terms simply by the ear. Now the mantle, <span class="accented">addereth</span>, though used of the Shinar shawl stolen by Achan (<a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21, 24</a>), was the distinctive dress of the prophets, but naturally was never worn by Samuel himself. Special dresses come into use only gradually, and Elijah is the first person described as being thus clad. Long before his time the schools of the prophets had grown into a national institution, and a loose wrapper of coarse cloth made of camel's hair, fastened round the body at the waist by a leathern girdle, had become the usual prophetic dress, and continued so to be until the arrival of Israel's last prophet, John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). The garment here spoken of is the <span class="accented">meil</span>, on which see <a href="/1_samuel/2-19.htm">1 Samuel 2:19</a>, where it was shown to be the ordinary dress of people of various classes in easy circumstances. Now the <span class="accented">meil</span> was not a loosely flowing garment, but fitted rather closely to the body, and, therefore, the tearing of it implies a considerable amount of violence on Saul's part. <span class="cmt_word">Skirt</span>, moreover, gives a wrong idea. What Saul took hold of was the <span class="accented">hem</span>, the outer border of the garment, probably at Samuel's neck or shoulder, as he turned to go away. He seized him, as we should say, by the collar, and endeavoured by main force to retain him, and in the struggle the hem rent. And Samuel, using it as an omen, said, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</span> <span class="accented">Neighbour</span> is used in Hebrew in a very indefinite manner, and here means generally "some one, whoever it may be," but one who will discharge the duties of thy office better than thou hast done (comp. <a href="/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
