Jesse is a significant figure in biblical history, as he is part of the lineage of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah coming from the line of David (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). David's role as a shepherd and later as king foreshadows Christ, the Good Shepherd and King of Kings.<p><b>an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the "House of Bread," is a small town with great significance. It is the birthplace of David and later Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The term "Ephrathite" refers to the ancient name of the region, Ephrath, highlighting the deep historical roots of David's family.<p><b>who had eight sons</b><br>Jesse's eight sons indicate a large family, which was a sign of blessing and prosperity in ancient Israelite culture. David, being the youngest, emphasizes the biblical theme of God choosing the least likely or the humble to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>And in the days of Saul</b><br>This phrase sets the historical context during the reign of King Saul, Israel's first king. The period was marked by political and spiritual turmoil, as Saul struggled with obedience to God. David's rise during Saul's reign highlights the transition from a monarchy based on human choice to one established by divine appointment.<p><b>Jesse was old and well along in years</b><br>Jesse's advanced age suggests wisdom and experience, yet it also implies that he may not have been able to participate actively in the events unfolding. This detail underscores the importance of David's role in stepping up to face Goliath and later becoming king, as God often uses the young and seemingly insignificant to accomplish His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, later anointed as the king of Israel.

And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55-58</a>, in the Vatican LXX. This omission was, no doubt, owing to the difficulty connected with this mention of David, where he is apparently introduced for the first time into the history; the LXX. translation not un-frequently adding or subtracting from the text when anything met them which they could not readily understand. The passage, as we find it, is undoubtedly genuine; the probable explanation of what puzzled the LXX. is given below.<p>It is, however, better (with the Syriac Version) to place all the words after "Beth-lehem-judah" down to the end of <a href="/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14</a> in a parenthesis. <a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm" title="But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.">1Samuel 17:15</a>, after the parenthesis descriptive of Jesse and his three elder sons, takes up the account of David again, thus: "But David went," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Went among men for an old man.</span>--This rendering follows the translation of Jerome's Vulgate, "Senex et grandaevus inter viros," rather than the Hebrew. The literal translation of <span class= "ital">ba-ba?nashim </span>would be <span class= "ital">went among men. </span>It is best to assume that the verb <span class= "ital">ba- </span>here is used elliptically for <span class= "ital">ba-bayamin, </span>"was advanced in days," that is, "was an old man." Keil renders <span class= "ital">baanashim </span>"among the weak," that is, "Jesse had come to be reckoned among the weak" (or the aged). Maurer and others believe the present Hebrew reading corrupt; the sense, however, is clear.<p>Jesse is represented in this parenthesis, descriptive of the father of David, for some reason known only to the compiler, as already an old man. Possibly this notice is inserted to explain the reason why the father of the future hero-king of Israel was not among the warriors of Saul. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesse... went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</span> This translation is taken from the Vulgate; but the Hebrew is, "And the man in the days of Saul was old, gone among men." Some explain this as meaning "placed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "reckoned among men of rank;" but probably an aleph has dropped out in the word rendered men, and we should read <span class="accented">"gone," i.e.</span> "advanced in years."
