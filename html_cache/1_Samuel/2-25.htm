In the ancient Israelite context, disputes between individuals could be resolved through the law and priestly mediation. The role of priests as mediators is seen throughout the Old Testament, where they offer sacrifices and prayers on behalf of the people (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>). The idea is that God provides a means for reconciliation and justice among humans, reflecting His desire for peace and order within the community.<p><b>but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?&#8221;</b><br>This part underscores the gravity of sinning directly against God. In the Old Testament, sins against God often involved idolatry, blasphemy, or direct disobedience to His commands. The rhetorical question implies the seriousness of such offenses, suggesting that no human mediator can stand between a sinner and God. This foreshadows the need for a perfect mediator, which Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), who intercedes on behalf of humanity before God.<p><b>But they would not listen to their father,</b><br>This refers to the sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, who were priests but acted wickedly (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). Their refusal to heed their father's warning reflects a hardened heart and a rejection of parental and spiritual authority. In the cultural context, honoring one's parents was a fundamental commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and their disobedience signifies a deeper rebellion against God's established order.<p><b>since the LORD intended to put them to death.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine judgment. The concept of God hardening hearts or allowing individuals to persist in their sin is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as with Pharaoh in Exodus (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). It reflects the biblical principle that persistent sin leads to judgment (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>). The death of Eli's sons serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the seriousness with which God views the corruption of those who are meant to serve Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>- The high priest of Israel and judge, who served at Shiloh.
