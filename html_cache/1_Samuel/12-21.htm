In the context of 1 Samuel, the Israelites were tempted to follow other gods and practices of surrounding nations, which were considered worthless in comparison to the worship of Yahweh. The term "worthless things" can also refer to material possessions or pursuits that distract from a life devoted to God. This echoes the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, "You shall have no other gods before Me," emphasizing the exclusivity of worship due to God alone. The admonition to not turn aside suggests a deliberate choice to remain faithful, highlighting the importance of steadfastness in one's spiritual journey.<p><b>that cannot profit you</b><br>The idea of profit here is not merely financial but encompasses spiritual and moral benefits. The prophets often criticized the futility of idol worship, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where idols are described as incapable of providing any real help or benefit. The emphasis is on the inability of these "worthless things" to contribute to one's spiritual well-being or salvation. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth, pointing to the eternal value of spiritual pursuits over temporal gains.<p><b>or deliver you</b><br>Deliverance in the biblical sense often refers to salvation or rescue from danger, oppression, or sin. In the historical context of 1 Samuel, the Israelites frequently sought deliverance from their enemies, and God was their ultimate deliverer. The phrase underscores the impotence of idols or false gods to provide true deliverance, contrasting with God's proven ability to save His people, as seen in the Exodus narrative. This also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Savior in the New Testament, offering deliverance from sin and death (<a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>for they are empty</b><br>The term "empty" signifies the lack of substance or reality in idols and false pursuits. This is a common theme in the Old Testament, where idols are often depicted as lifeless and powerless (<a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>). The emptiness of these pursuits is contrasted with the fullness of life found in a relationship with God. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded upon in <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, where believers are warned against being taken captive by hollow and deceptive philosophy. The emptiness of worldly pursuits is ultimately contrasted with the fullness of life and purpose found in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy.

Joshua gave the same charge before his death (<a href="/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6</a>). Proverbs echoes it: &#8220;Do not swerve to the right or to the left&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>).

Jeremiah laments, &#8220;They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>). Jonah confessed, &#8220;Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>).
