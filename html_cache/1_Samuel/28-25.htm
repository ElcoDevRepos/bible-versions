This act of serving is significant in the cultural context of ancient Israel, where hospitality was a deeply ingrained value. The meal signifies a moment of respite and normalcy amidst the chaos and fear Saul is experiencing. The act of serving also highlights the woman's role in the narrative, providing sustenance to the king despite the circumstances. This moment can be contrasted with other biblical instances of hospitality, such as Abraham serving the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, emphasizing the importance of hospitality in biblical narratives.<p><b>and they ate</b><br>Eating together in the biblical context often symbolizes fellowship and covenant. In this instance, however, the meal is tinged with irony and foreboding. Saul, who is seeking guidance from a medium against God's commandments (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>), partakes in a meal that does not bring peace or divine favor. This contrasts with the Last Supper in the New Testament, where Jesus shares a meal with His disciples, symbolizing the new covenant. Saul's meal lacks the spiritual nourishment and covenantal significance found in other scriptural meals.<p><b>And that night they got up and left</b><br>The phrase "that night" underscores the urgency and darkness of the situation. Nighttime in biblical literature often symbolizes danger, uncertainty, and spiritual darkness. Saul's departure under the cover of night reflects his spiritual state&#8212;disconnected from God and facing impending doom. This moment foreshadows Saul's tragic end, as he leaves without the guidance or assurance he sought. The act of leaving at night can be compared to Judas Iscariot leaving the Last Supper to betray Jesus, highlighting themes of betrayal, spiritual blindness, and the consequences of turning away from God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of desperation and fear due to the impending battle with the Philistines and God's silence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_medium_at_endor.htm">The Medium at Endor</a></b><br>A woman who practices necromancy, whom Saul consults in defiance of God's law, seeking guidance from the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The deceased prophet who is summoned by the medium, delivering a message of judgment to Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>The location where Saul visits the medium, despite having previously banned such practices in Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul's_servants.htm">Saul's Servants</a></b><br>Those who accompany Saul to Endor, witnessing his actions and the events that unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's actions at Endor are a culmination of his repeated disobedience to God.

The witch&#8217;s meal shows God&#8217;s common grace, sustaining Saul&#8217;s body even as his soul drifts from obedience. Surrounded by servants and physical provision, he remains spiritually empty, walking into literal and figurative darkness.

"Saul was too hardened in his sin to express any grief or pain, either on his own account or because of the predicted fate of his sons or his people. In stolid desperation he went to meet his destiny. This was the terrible end of one whom the Spirit of God had once taken possession of and turned into another man--of one who had been singularly endowed with Divine gifts to enable him to act as the leader of the people of God."--<span class= "ital">O. von Gerlach.</span><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She served</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1447;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tag&#183;g&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
