Saul's increasing jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and success led him to seek David's life. The messengers were likely soldiers or officials tasked with bringing David back to Saul. This event occurs in the context of Saul's repeated attempts to kill David, highlighting the tension and danger David faced. The messengers' entry into the house signifies the urgency and seriousness of Saul's command.<p><b>there was the idol in the bed</b><br>The "idol" mentioned here is a household idol, or "teraphim," which were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These idols were often used for divination or as protective household deities. The presence of an idol in David's house, which he shared with Michal, Saul's daughter, may indicate Michal's syncretistic practices or simply a cultural artifact. The use of the idol in this context is a clever ruse by Michal to deceive Saul's messengers, buying David time to escape. This act of deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals use cunning to protect God's chosen, such as Rahab hiding the spies in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<p><b>with the goat hair on its head</b><br>The goat hair was used to mimic David's hair, making the idol appear as if it were a person lying in bed. This detail underscores Michal's resourcefulness and quick thinking in the face of danger. Goat hair was a common material in the ancient world, used for various purposes, including clothing and tents. The use of goat hair here is a practical choice, likely because it was readily available and could convincingly resemble human hair. This act of deception parallels other biblical narratives where disguises or substitutions are used to achieve a greater purpose, such as Jacob disguising himself as Esau in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is being pursued by King Saul due to Saul's jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>David's wife and Saul's daughter, who helps David escape from Saul's attempt to kill him by deceiving the messengers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly paranoid and hostile towards David, seeing him as a threat to his reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Sent by Saul to capture David, they are deceived by Michal's ruse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_idol.htm">The Idol</a></b><br>Used by Michal to create the illusion that David is in bed, highlighting the use of deception to protect David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_deception_in_protection.htm">The Role of Deception in Protection</a></b><br>While deception is generally discouraged in Scripture, there are instances where it is used to protect God's anointed or His people.
