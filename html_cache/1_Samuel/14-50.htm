Her name means "brother of pleasantness" or "my brother is delight," which may reflect her character or the hopes of her family. Ahinoam is also the name of one of David's wives, which can sometimes cause confusion in biblical narratives. The mention of her father, Ahimaaz, provides a genealogical link, emphasizing the importance of family lineage in Israelite society. This detail underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israel, where family connections often influenced social and political standing.<p><b>The name of the commander of his army was Abner,</b><br>Abner, whose name means "father of light" or "my father is a lamp," was a significant military leader in Israel. As the commander of Saul's army, he played a crucial role in the military campaigns against the Philistines and other enemies. Abner's leadership and loyalty to Saul are evident throughout the narrative of 1 Samuel. His position as commander highlights the importance of military strength and strategy in maintaining the kingdom's stability and security. Abner's later interactions with David, after Saul's death, show his influence and the complex political dynamics of the time.<p><b>the son of Saul&#8217;s uncle Ner.</b><br>This phrase establishes Abner's familial connection to Saul, indicating that he was Saul's cousin. Such family ties were significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where kinship often determined political alliances and positions of power. The mention of Ner, Saul's uncle, provides additional genealogical context, emphasizing the interconnectedness of Saul's family. This connection may have contributed to Abner's loyalty to Saul and his initial opposition to David's rise to power. The familial relationship also reflects the tribal and familial nature of leadership in ancient Israel, where authority was often concentrated within extended family networks.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This intertwining of kinship and command shows how Saul consolidated authority, yet it also foreshadows later complications when family loyalties clash with obedience to God (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; 3:6&#8211;11).<p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s role fulfills the need for organized defense as Israel transitions from judges to monarchy (<a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19&#8211;20</a>). His presence underscores that God equips His people with practical leadership structures while still expecting wholehearted reliance on the Lord of hosts (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly contrasts Saul&#8217;s human strategies&#8212;family appointments, standing army&#8212;with Jonathan&#8217;s earlier faith-filled victory (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>), encouraging readers to measure success by trust in God rather than by human connections.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a> situates Saul&#8217;s reign within concrete relationships: a covenantal marriage to Ahinoam and a military command entrusted to his cousin Abner. By recording these details, Scripture affirms the historical accuracy of Saul&#8217;s household, highlights God&#8217;s concern for both family integrity and national leadership, and invites us to trust the Lord above all familial or institutional structures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(50) <span class= "bld">Saul's wife.</span>--In accordance with a usual practice, the name of the most prominent of the family and royal household of the king are given. We know nothing of Saul's queen besides her name. It has been surmised that she was of the family of Eli, the high priest, owing to the <span class= "ital">Ah </span>(brother) entering into her name and that of her father, Ahimaaz, as this compound was apparently the favourite prefix to names in this great and renowned house. The simplicity and modesty of the king's domestic habits is evident. Ewald thinks from this circumstance that he had only this one wife and one concubine, Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, afterwards so famous for her sad misfortunes and for her devoted love to her ill-fated children. (See <a href="/context/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8-12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The captain of his host was Abner.</span>--This "cousin"--or, as some have understood the sentence, the uncle--of King Saul was evidently a man of rare powers and ability. The brilliant campaigns of this reign were, no doubt, in no small measure owing to the military skill of this great commander. After the terrible disaster on Mount Gilboa, Abner was the mainstay of the house of the dead King Saul, and when he died the generous David followed the bier, and lamented over him with a lamentation which has come down to us in words ever memorable: "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel." His son Jaasiel was subsequently allowed the first place in the tribe of Benjamin. (See <a href="/1_chronicles/27-21.htm" title="Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:">1Chronicles 27:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz.</span> We have noticed on ver. 3 the fondness of the family of Eli for names beginning with <span class="accented">Ah</span>, "brother."
