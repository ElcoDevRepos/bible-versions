The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe and long-standing enemies of Israel, often attacking and plundering. The capture of "women and all who were there, both young and old" indicates a complete and indiscriminate taking of the population, reflecting the brutal nature of ancient warfare. This act of taking captives was common in ancient times, serving as a means to gain slaves or leverage for ransom. The Amalekites' actions here are consistent with their historical enmity towards Israel, as seen in previous conflicts (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). The capture without immediate killing suggests a strategic move, possibly to use the captives for labor or as bargaining tools.<p><b>They had not killed anyone, but had carried them off as they went on their way.</b><br>The fact that the Amalekites "had not killed anyone" is significant, as it contrasts with the often ruthless nature of ancient raids. This restraint may have been due to the Amalekites' intention to use the captives for slavery or ransom, which was a common practice. The phrase "carried them off" implies a forced relocation, likely involving harsh conditions and uncertainty for the captives. This situation sets the stage for David's subsequent pursuit and rescue mission, highlighting his role as a deliverer, a type of Christ who rescues and redeems. The sparing of lives here can also be seen as providential, allowing for the possibility of restoration and reconciliation, themes that resonate throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who was leading his men during this time of distress.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that frequently opposed Israel, known for their raids and attacks.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>A Philistine town given to David, which served as his base of operations during his time away from Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_and_children.htm">Women and Children</a></b><br>The captives taken by the Amalekites, representing the families of David and his men.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/raid.htm">Raid</a></b><br>The event where the Amalekites attacked Ziklag, taking captives but not killing anyone.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>Even in distressing situations, God is in control.

David--never dreaming of the sudden invasion--had marched with Achish, accompanied by his whole force. The Amalekites slew none of their captives; they were, we read, women and children. These possessed a marketable value, and were carried off to be sold into slavery, probably in Egypt, with which country the Amalekites, as neighbours, had constant dealings. We read a few verses on specially of an <span class= "ital">Egyptian </span>slave in the army.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They slew not any.</span> No resistance was made, as the men of war were all away. It was probably for thus leaving their wives and families absolutely defenceless that David's people were so angry with him. As we are told in <a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a> that the refugees with David had brought each his household with him into the Philistine territory, the number of women must have been large. The Amalekites spared their lives, not because they were more merciful than David, but because women and children were valuable as slaves. All the best would be picked out, and sent probably to Egypt for sale. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They had taken captive</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;b&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
