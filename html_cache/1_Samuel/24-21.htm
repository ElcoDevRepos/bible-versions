Swearing by the LORD indicates the invocation of God's authority and presence as a witness to the oath. This reflects the cultural and religious significance of oaths in biblical times, where breaking an oath was seen as a serious offense against God (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). The use of God's name in the oath underscores the gravity of the request and the trust Saul places in David's integrity.<p><b>that you will not cut off my descendants</b><br>Saul's request for the protection of his descendants is rooted in the historical context of royal succession in the ancient Near East, where new kings often eliminated the family of their predecessors to secure their own throne. Saul's plea reflects his awareness of the potential threat to his lineage due to David's rising prominence. This request also highlights the theme of covenant loyalty, as David had previously shown kindness to Jonathan, Saul's son, and had made a covenant with him (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). This foreshadows David's later actions in <a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>, where he honors his promise by showing kindness to Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son.<p><b>or wipe out my name from my father&#8217;s house.</b><br>The concern for preserving one's name and legacy was significant in the ancient world, as it was tied to one's honor and memory. Saul's request reflects a desire for his family line to continue and be remembered, which was a common concern in biblical times (<a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>). The phrase "wipe out my name" suggests the complete eradication of Saul's lineage and legacy, which would be a source of shame and dishonor. This request also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in preserving the line of David, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). Saul's plea, therefore, indirectly points to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God and his complex relationship with King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who becomes increasingly paranoid and hostile towards David, fearing the loss of his throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_en_gedi.htm">The Wilderness of En Gedi</a></b><br>A rugged, desert area near the Dead Sea where David and his men hide from Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cave_encounter.htm">The Cave Encounter</a></b><br>A significant event where David spares Saul's life, demonstrating mercy and respect for God's anointed king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oath.htm">The Oath</a></b><br>Saul requests David to swear an oath to preserve his family line, acknowledging David's future as king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_anointed.htm">Respect for God's Anointed</a></b><br>David's respect for Saul, despite Saul's hostility, teaches us to honor those in authority, trusting God's timing and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_mercy.htm">The Power of Mercy</a></b><br>David's decision to spare Saul's life exemplifies the power of mercy and forgiveness, encouraging us to extend grace even to our adversaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_integrity.htm">The Importance of Integrity</a></b><br>The oath David makes to Saul underscores the importance of keeping our promises and maintaining integrity in our relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trusting God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>David's restraint and trust in God's plan remind us to rely on God's sovereignty rather than taking matters into our own hands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_future_generations.htm">Legacy and Future Generations</a></b><br>Saul's concern for his descendants highlights the importance of considering the impact of our actions on future generations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_24_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 24:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_21_David_respects_God_s_king.htm">How does 1 Samuel 24:21 demonstrate David's respect for God's anointed king?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_forgiveness_in_1_Sam_24_21.htm">What lessons on forgiveness can we learn from 1 Samuel 24:21?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_David_s_promise_to_Matt_5_44.htm">How does David's promise in 1 Samuel 24:21 connect to Matthew 5:44?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_David_s_integrity_daily.htm">In what ways can we apply David's integrity in our daily conflicts?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_21_Trust_God_not_revenge.htm">How does 1 Samuel 24:21 encourage us to trust God's plan over revenge?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_21_David_respects_God_s_king_2.htm">How does 1 Samuel 24:21 demonstrate David's respect for God's anointed king?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Saul_want_David_s_oath.htm">Why does Saul ask David to swear an oath in 1 Samuel 24:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_21_Saul_s_view_on_kingship.htm">What does 1 Samuel 24:21 reveal about Saul's understanding of his own kingship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_2_sam_24_and_1_chr_21_differ.htm">Why do 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 differ in their attribution of who prompted David's census--God or Satan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_saul's_hostility_persist_later.htm">If Saul recognized David&#8217;s righteousness (1 Samuel 24:16&#8211;21), why did hostilities continue in later chapters, suggesting inconsistency? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_incited_david's_census.htm">Who incited David to take a census?

Confronted with David&#8217;s mercy, Saul shifts from hostility to humility. The phrase &#8220;So now&#8221; signals a pivotal moment where Saul stops fighting God&#8217;s plan and turns to seek a covenant. Similar turning points appear when Esau softens toward Jacob (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4&#8211;9</a>) and when the Ninevites repent at Jonah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5&#8211;9</a>). God&#8217;s providence often brings people to these &#8220;now&#8221; moments where their only reasonable response is to yield.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>swear to me by the LORD</b><p>Saul appeals to the highest authority: &#8220;by the LORD.&#8221; Oaths made in God&#8217;s name were binding (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>). He is effectively saying, &#8220;Invoke the covenant-keeping God as witness that you will keep this promise.&#8221; David agrees (<a href="/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>), showing his own reverence for the LORD&#8217;s reputation (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>). Generations later, David&#8217;s dynasty is protected because of such oaths (<a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>), illustrating that promises grounded in God&#8217;s name carry enduring weight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you will not cut off my descendants</b><p>In the ancient Near East, a new king often eliminated the former king&#8217;s heirs to secure the throne (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>). Saul pleads for an exception. God&#8217;s law had already forbidden Israelite families from being punished corporately for one person&#8217;s sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>), yet political reality frequently ignored that command. Saul&#8217;s request recognizes David&#8217;s future kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/24-20.htm">1 Samuel 24:20</a>) and appeals for covenant mercy, foreshadowing the gospel pattern of enemies becoming beneficiaries of grace (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or wipe out my name from my father&#8217;s house</b><p>A &#8220;name&#8221; in Scripture represents identity, legacy, and memory (<a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>). To erase a name meant extinguishing every trace of a family line (<a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>). Saul wants his lineage remembered, not erased. David later fulfills this by honoring Mephibosheth, Jonathan&#8217;s son: &#8220;I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1, 7</a>). In doing so David preserves Saul&#8217;s name, modeling God&#8217;s faithfulness that keeps covenant love to &#8220;a thousand generations&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/24-21.htm">1 Samuel 24:21</a> captures Saul&#8217;s plea for covenant mercy at the very moment he concedes that David will be king. By invoking the LORD&#8217;s name, Saul seeks a binding guarantee that his family will not be exterminated nor his memory erased. David&#8217;s later kindness to Mephibosheth proves the promise was kept, illustrating that godly leadership blends justice with steadfast love, and that God&#8217;s sovereign plans unfold without abandoning mercy to those who humbly ask.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Swear now therefore unto me.</span>--So strongly was Saul convinced at this moment that David would at no distant period of time occupy the throne of Israel that he entreated him, when that day should come, not to destroy all his (Saul's) children. This barbarous custom has been always too common a practice in the jealous East. It seems to have been equally dreaded by Jonathan, who made--it will be remembered--this condition of mercy to be shown by David in his day of power to his (Jonathan's) children a part of the solemn covenant concluded between them. (See <a href="/1_samuel/20-15.htm" title="But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.">1Samuel 20:15</a>.) In the frequent dynastic changes which took place in the kingdom of Israel, we have instances of such wholesale massacres of the royal family of the fallen house. (See <a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1Kings 15:29</a>, where Baasha slew King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, and took his throne. Then Baasha, we read, "smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed; "and in <a href="/1_kings/16-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.">1Kings 16:11</a>, where Zimri murdered his master, King Baasha. Zimri, "as soon as he sat on his throne, slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.") A similar massacre is described, only with more ghastly details, in 2 Kings 10, where "Jehu slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria." There the story is peculiarly an Oriental scene of history, with the seventy baskets containing the seventy heads of princes presented as an acceptable offering to the new stern king of Israel--Jehu. It was, therefore, no vain dread of what might happen in the future which made King Saul ask this of David. Doubtless the fear of some such awful catastrophe happening to his own loved children and friends was no small part of the punishment of Saul.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
