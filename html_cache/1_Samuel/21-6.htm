This bread was typically reserved for the priests, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The act of giving this bread to David highlights the principle that human need can take precedence over ceremonial law, a point later emphasized by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a> when He references this event to illustrate the importance of mercy over sacrifice.<p><b>since there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence</b><br>The Bread of the Presence, or showbread, was a sacred offering placed on a table in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle, and later the Temple, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>. It symbolized God's provision and presence among His people. The fact that there was no other bread available underscores the urgency of David's situation and the priest's willingness to prioritize compassion over ritual.<p><b>which had been removed from before the LORD</b><br>The bread was placed before the LORD as a continual offering, signifying the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It was replaced weekly on the Sabbath, as per <a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>. The removal of the bread indicates the regular practice of replacing it, ensuring that the offering remained fresh and symbolically sustaining.<p><b>and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away</b><br>This detail highlights the meticulous observance of the ritual, ensuring that the Bread of the Presence was always fresh. The replacement of the bread with hot, newly baked loaves signifies the ongoing nature of God's provision and presence. This practice points to the importance of maintaining a continual relationship with God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture. The fresh bread can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering continual spiritual sustenance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul and seeking sustenance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a></b><br>The priest at Nob who provides David with the consecrated bread.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>The city of priests where Ahimelech serves and where the tabernacle is located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_of_the_presence.htm">Bread of the Presence</a></b><br>Also known as "showbread," this is the consecrated bread placed in the tabernacle as an offering to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, before whom the Bread of the Presence is placed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_need.htm">God's Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>David's reception of the consecrated bread illustrates God's provision for His people, even in unconventional ways.
