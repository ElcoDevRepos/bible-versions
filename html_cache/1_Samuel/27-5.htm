This interaction highlights David's complex relationship with the Philistines, who were traditionally enemies of Israel. David's presence in Gath is a strategic move to escape King Saul's pursuit. Achish's willingness to host David suggests a level of trust or political advantage perceived by Achish.<p><b>If I have found favor in your eyes</b><br>David seeks to gain favor with Achish, indicating a diplomatic approach. This phrase reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of seeking favor from a ruler, which often involved showing loyalty or offering service. David's request implies a desire for peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit.<p><b>let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns</b><br>David requests a place in the countryside, away from the central power of Gath. This request shows David's humility and strategic thinking, as living in an outlying town would allow him more freedom and less scrutiny. It also reflects the practice of granting land or towns to trusted individuals as a form of patronage.<p><b>so I can live there</b><br>David's intention to live in a Philistine town indicates his need for refuge and stability. This move is part of his broader strategy to avoid Saul and build his own base of support. It also foreshadows his eventual kingship, as he learns to govern and lead outside of Israel.<p><b>For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?</b><br>David refers to himself as Achish's servant, a term of humility and submission. This rhetorical question underscores David's desire to avoid drawing attention or causing political tension in Gath. It also highlights his wisdom in seeking a position that would not threaten Achish's authority, while still allowing him to maintain his own leadership over his men.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

Speaking directly to Achish, king of Gath, marks a remarkable twist: the anointed king of Israel is addressing a Philistine ruler. Earlier, David had feigned madness before this same leader to save his life (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>), yet now Achish trusts him (27:2-3). God&#8217;s providence is evident&#8212;He can turn enemies into protectors when advancing His purposes, just as He later used Cyrus for Israel&#8217;s return (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; 45:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I have found favor in your eyes</b><p>David approaches respectfully, a pattern seen in Scripture whenever someone petitions a superior (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>; <a href="/esther/8-5.htm">Esther 8:5</a>). Though he is God&#8217;s chosen king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), David models humility:<p>&#8226; He does not demand; he requests.<p>&#8226; He acknowledges Achish&#8217;s authority even while ultimately trusting the Lord (<a href="/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>, a psalm composed &#8220;when he fled from Saul in the cave&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows David is aware that favor&#8212;whether from man or God&#8212;is a gift, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>: &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there</b><p>David seeks Ziklag (granted in <a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). Several practical and spiritual motives rise to the surface:<p>&#8226; Protection for his growing band of 600 men and their families (27:3).<p>&#8226; Freedom from constant scrutiny inside a Philistine royal city, allowing him to act without compromising Israelite loyalties&#8212;a wisdom Jesus later advocates when telling His disciples to be &#8220;shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Provision: an outlying town gives space for livelihood, foreshadowing God&#8217;s pattern of giving His people places of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-1.htm">Joshua 20:1-9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p>God even turns this arrangement into a future inheritance for Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a> states &#8220;Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day&#8221;), underscoring <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?</b><p>Calling himself &#8220;your servant&#8221; displays humility and strategic wisdom:<p>&#8226; David avoids rivalry with Philistine lords (compare the suspicion voiced in <a href="/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; He seeks distance from pagan practices at court, an echo of Daniel&#8217;s later request to avoid defilement at Babylon&#8217;s table (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-14</a>).<p>&#8226; By living apart, David can conduct raids against Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8-9</a>) without Philistine oversight, preserving his true allegiance.<p>His question mirrors Joseph&#8217;s respectful negotiation with Pharaoh for Goshen (<a href="/genesis/47-4.htm">Genesis 47:4-6</a>). David&#8217;s submission is genuine, yet he remains God&#8217;s servant first&#8212;a delicate balance believers still face (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5</a> records David&#8217;s humble yet calculated request to live outside Achish&#8217;s royal city. He honors authority, seeks favor, and obtains space (Ziklag) that both protects his people and advances God&#8217;s larger plan. The verse teaches that humility before men, combined with unwavering trust in the Lord, opens doors and turns even hostile settings into stages for divine purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</span>--The real reason why David wished a separate residence was that he might conduct his forays and other affairs apart from the supervision of his Philistine friends. <span class= "ital">They </span>had one purpose in welcoming him and his band, <span class= "ital">he </span>had quite another. Achish trusted that through David's assistance powerful military demonstrations in the southern districts of Saul's kingdom might be made. At this time the Philistine nation were preparing for that grand national effort against Saul which culminated in the battle of Mount Gilboa. David, on the other hand, intended, from a comparatively secure centre of operations somewhere in Philistia, to harry those nomad foes of Israel whose home was in the deserts to the south of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If l have now found grace in thine eyes.</span> <span class="accented">Now</span> is not an adverb of time, but means "I pray," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> If verily I have found favour with thee. David's position was one of difficulty. The fame of his exploits, and of Saul's vain pursuit of him, made Achish no doubt regard him as a bitter foe of the Israelite king, and expect valuable assistance from him; whereas David was unwilling to take up arms even against Saul, and much less against his own countrymen. He is anxious, therefore, to get away from a too close observation of his acts, and requests Achish to give him <span class="cmt_word">a place in some town in the country.</span> Hebrew, "a place in one of the cities in the field." <span class="cmt_word">Why should thy servant,</span> etc. David's presence with so large a following must in many ways have been inconvenient as well as expensive to Achish.
