The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles for control of the land. The outpost represents a strategic military position, and the Philistines' confidence is evident in their taunting call. Jonathan, the son of King Saul, is accompanied by his armor-bearer, a common practice in ancient warfare where a young man would assist a warrior by carrying his armor and weapons.<p><b>&#8220;Come on up, and we will teach you a lesson!&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines' challenge is both a taunt and an invitation to battle, reflecting their arrogance and underestimation of Jonathan and his armor-bearer. This phrase captures the Philistines' confidence in their military superiority. The cultural context of the time often involved direct challenges and duels as a means of resolving conflicts or demonstrating strength, as seen in the story of David and Goliath.<p><b>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; Jonathan told his armor-bearer</b><br>Jonathan's leadership and faith are evident in his command. Despite the odds, he is willing to confront the enemy, demonstrating courage and initiative.

Jonathan's relationship with his armor-bearer also highlights the importance of loyalty and trust in leadership.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals Jonathan's faith and reliance on God for victory. It echoes the biblical theme of divine intervention in battles, where God delivers enemies into the hands of His people. This phrase connects to other scriptures where God assures victory, such as in the stories of Gideon and David. Jonathan's declaration can be seen as a type of Christ, who also trusted in God's deliverance and led His followers with faith and assurance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

Philistine arrogance validates Jonathan&#8217;s prayed-for sign, prompting immediate, fearless action. Secure in God&#8217;s already-accomplished deliverance, Jonathan leads his companion upward, knowing the Lord has handed the foe to Israel. The verse teaches that when God&#8217;s people cling to His promises, even hostile taunts become confirmations of coming victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.</span> The Philistines thus give Jonathan the very omen he had desired. The last clause is a popular phrase, and expresses a sort of amused contempt for the two adventurers.
