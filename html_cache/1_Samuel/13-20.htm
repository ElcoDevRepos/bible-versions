The Philistines had a technological advantage, particularly in metallurgy, which they used to dominate the Israelites. This situation reflects the broader theme of Israel's struggle with surrounding nations due to their disobedience to God. The Israelites' dependence on the Philistines for sharpening tools underscores their lack of self-sufficiency and the consequences of not fully driving out the inhabitants of the Promised Land as commanded in earlier scriptures (<a href="/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28-36</a>).<p><b>to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.</b><br>The mention of these specific tools indicates the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites and their need for functional implements to sustain their livelihood. The plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle were essential for farming and maintaining their land. The necessity to rely on the Philistines for sharpening these tools not only signifies economic and technological dependence but also a spiritual metaphor for the dullness of Israel's faith and obedience. This dependence can be contrasted with the prophetic vision in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where nations will beat their swords into plowshares, symbolizing peace and divine provision. The tools themselves can be seen as types of spiritual readiness, where believers are called to be sharp and prepared for the work of God, much like the tools needed to be effective for agricultural purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who were under the leadership
