The Philistines were a dominant force in the region, and some Hebrews may have sought safety or advantage by aligning with them. This reflects the turbulent period of the Judges and early monarchy when Israel was often oppressed by neighboring peoples (<a href="/judges/13.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). The term "Hebrews" is used here to emphasize their ethnic identity, distinct from the Philistines.<p><b>to join the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this time, often engaging in battles with them. Historically, the Philistines were part of the Sea Peoples who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their military prowess, including the use of iron weapons, made them formidable opponents. The defection of some Israelites to the Philistines highlights the dire situation Israel faced and the internal divisions within the nation.<p><b>now went over to the Israelites</b><br>This shift indicates a change in allegiance, likely prompted by the events of the battle where Jonathan and his armor-bearer initiated a successful attack against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-14</a>). The turning of the tide in battle would have encouraged those who had defected to return to their own people. This act of returning can be seen as a form of repentance or realignment with God's chosen people.<p><b>who were with Saul and Jonathan</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, was leading the Israelite forces, though his leadership was often marked by fear and indecision. Jonathan, his son, demonstrated faith and courage, as seen earlier in the chapter. The mention of both Saul and Jonathan highlights the contrast between Saul's faltering leadership and Jonathan's bold faith. This narrative foreshadows the eventual rise of David, another man of faith, who would succeed Saul as king. The unity of the Israelites under Saul and Jonathan at this moment signifies a temporary consolidation of the nation against their common enemy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who had previously aligned themselves with the Philistines, possibly out of fear or coercion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during this period, known for their military strength and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, leading the Israelites in battle against the Philistines.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Son of Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God, playing a crucial role in the battle against the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>The location where the Philistines were encamped, and where the Hebrews who had defected were present before rejoining the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/returning_to_god's_people.htm">Returning to God&#8217;s People</a></b><br>Just as the Hebrews returned to their fellow Israelites, believers are called to return to fellowship with God&#8217;s people, especially after periods of spiritual wandering or compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Jonathan&#8217;s actions demonstrate that faith in God can lead to victory against overwhelming odds.

These, we read, took the first opportunity to go over to Saul. Other Israelites--probably the men of whole villages, who had been compelled, as the result of the late Philistine successes, to desert their homesteads, and seek a precarious living in the hills--joined in the pursuit of the now flying Philistine armies. This is the meaning of the words of the 22nd verse, which speaks of "the men of Israel which had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Round about, even.</span> All the versions by a very slight alteration change this into <span class="accented">turned</span>, which the A.V. is forced to supply. With this necessary correction the translation is easy: "And the Hebrews who were previously with the Philistines, and had gone up with them into the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan." It appears, therefore, that certain districts of the Israelite territory were so completely in the power of the Philistines that they could compel the men to go with them, not perhaps as soldiers, as is our custom in India, but as drivers and servants. These now turned upon their masters, and were reinforced by the Israelites who had taken refuge in Mount Ephraim. It is noteworthy that these subject "Hebrews" retain the name of contempt given them by their masters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the Hebrews</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8216;i&#7687;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
