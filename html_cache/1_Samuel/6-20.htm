The men of this city were likely familiar with the religious practices and the significance of the Ark of the Covenant. Their question arises after witnessing the consequences of mishandling the Ark, which had returned from Philistine captivity. This reflects a moment of fear and reverence, acknowledging the power and holiness of God.<p><b>&#8220;Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the holiness and majesty of God, emphasizing His separateness from sin and imperfection. The phrase echoes sentiments found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>, which asks, "Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?" It highlights the need for purity and reverence when approaching God, a theme consistent throughout the Bible. The holiness of God is a central attribute, and His presence demands respect and awe.<p><b>To whom should the ark go up from here?&#8221;</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the physical representation of God's presence among His people. The question reflects the community's recognition of their unworthiness and their desire to find a suitable place for the Ark. This moment foreshadows the eventual movement of the Ark to Jerusalem under King David, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>. It also points to the broader biblical narrative of God's presence moving among His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple and the embodiment of God's presence (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_beth-shemesh.htm">Men of Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>Residents of a Levitical city in the territory of Judah, who were involved in the handling of the Ark of the Covenant after it was returned by the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-shemesh.htm">Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>A city allocated to the Levites, located in the Shephelah region of Judah, significant for its role in the return of the Ark.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people who captured the Ark in battle but returned it due to the calamities it brought upon them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose holiness and presence are central to the events surrounding the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>God's holiness demands reverence and respect.

The immediate judgment convinced them that God&#8217;s presence is not something anyone can simply approach on their own terms.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that mere humans cannot bear God&#8217;s unveiled holiness: Moses hid his face at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>), Israel trembled at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>), and Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe is me!&#8221; when he saw the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> echoes the same question: &#8220;Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart.&#8221; The answer required a righteousness none of us have apart from God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this holy God?</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;this holy God?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20</a>)<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness is His utter moral perfection and separation from sin (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>). It is not an optional attribute but the core of His being.<p>&#8211; In <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-9</a>, even David feared when Uzzah touched the ark. The pattern is clear: contact with the holy without proper mediation leads to death.<p>&#8226; Holiness reveals both God&#8217;s glory and our need:<p>&#8211; It exposes sin (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8211; It demands atonement; in the Old Covenant that meant sacrifices (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>), while in the New Covenant Christ became our perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The men&#8217;s dread is therefore logical: encountering perfect holiness while sinful is spiritually&#8212;and, as they had just seen, physically&#8212;hazardous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom should the ark go up from here?</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;To whom should the ark go up from here?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20</a>)<p>&#8226; Instead of repenting and seeking proper reverence, the townspeople&#8217;s instinct is to send the ark away. Their question reflects both fear and recognition that they cannot host God&#8217;s presence in a half-hearted manner.<p>&#8226; Similar episodes:<p>&#8211; The Gadarenes begged Jesus to depart after He cast out the demons (<a href="/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>).<p>&#8211; Peter exclaimed, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence demands decision: either humble submission and obedience or distancing oneself from Him. Tragically, Beth-shemesh chose distance, and the ark moved to Kiriath-jearim (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, Christ invites us to draw near with confidence because He has made us righteous (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The lesson remains: God is still holy, and casual familiarity devoid of reverence invites discipline (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20</a> records a visceral reaction to God&#8217;s holiness. Witnessing judgment, the men of Beth-shemesh realized no sinful person can stand before the LORD without His appointed means. Their fear was correct, yet their solution&#8212;send the ark away&#8212;missed the deeper invitation to repent and honor God properly. The verse therefore reminds us that God&#8217;s holiness is both terrifying and beautiful: terrifying when approached irreverently, beautiful when we come through the provision He Himself supplies in Christ. Honor His holiness, trust His provision, and you can stand in His presence with joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Who is able to stand?</span>--There is some superstition involved in this exclamation, "Whither shall we send this awful visitant?" The men of the priestly city of Beth-shemesh strangely connected their invisible King with that golden Ark, which, sacred though it was, was but a lifeless chest of wood and gold.<p>Yet through their superstition we can discern a deep consciousness of sin and shortcoming, which argued well for the future reformation of the religious life of the people--a grand work, which we shall soon sec Samuel the prophet labouring so faithfully and so successfully to bring about. These poor sinners, discerning the cause of the fatal stroke which had fallen upon their brethren, felt too surely that they were none of them any better really than those who had fallen victims to their impiety, and were fully sensible that sinners could not dwell in the presence of God. Carried away by this feeling of awe before the purity of the invisible King, they cried, "To whom shall He go up from us?"<p>These poor Hebrews felt the same fear as John was sensible of centuries later, when at the feet of the glorified Son of Man he fell as dead; but they, less blessed than John and the children of the kingdom, had no Redeemer there to raise them up with the loving whisper: "Fear not; I (whom thou dreadest) am He that liveth and was dead." (Sec <a href="/context/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:">Revelation 1:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is able,</span> etc. Literally, "Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God?" A punishment so severe following upon their unhallowed temerity made the inhabitants of this city of priests eager to pass the ark on to others.
