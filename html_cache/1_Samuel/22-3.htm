Mizpeh, meaning "watchtower," suggests a place of safety and observation. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, has historical ties to Israel through Ruth, David's great-grandmother, who was a Moabitess. This connection may have influenced David's decision to seek asylum there. The Moabites, though often enemies of Israel, had periods of peaceful relations, and David's lineage provided a potential diplomatic advantage.<p><b>where he said to the king of Moab</b><br>David approaches the king of Moab, indicating a formal request for protection. This interaction shows David's strategic acumen in seeking alliances and safe havens during his fugitive years. The king of Moab's willingness to entertain David's request may reflect the political dynamics of the time, where mutual enemies (such as Saul) could lead to temporary alliances.<p><b>&#8220;Please let my father and mother stay with you</b><br>David's concern for his parents highlights his filial piety and responsibility. Jesse, David's father, and his family were vulnerable due to Saul's hostility. By securing their safety, David ensures the continuation of his lineage, which is significant given the messianic prophecies associated with his line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This act also prefigures Christ's care for His own family and followers.<p><b>until I learn what God will do for me.&#8221;</b><br>David's statement reflects his reliance on divine guidance and providence. Despite his dire circumstances, he seeks to discern God's will, demonstrating faith and patience. This reliance on God is a recurring theme in David's life, as seen in his psalms and actions. It foreshadows the ultimate trust in God's plan exemplified by Jesus Christ, who consistently sought the Father's will (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>). David's faith in God's unfolding plan serves as a model for believers facing uncertainty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

The word means <span class= "ital">a watch tower; </span>it was probably some mountain fortress in Moab. It has been suggested that it was the same as Zophim, a word of the same root as Mizpeh (see <a href="/numbers/23-14.htm" title="And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.">Numbers 23:14</a>). David evidently sought hospitality among his kin in Moab. Jesse, his father, was the grandson of Ruth the Moabitess. The distance from the south of Judah Where the fugitives were wandering was not great.<p><span class= "bld">Till I know what God will do for me.</span>--This memory of David's words to the King of Moab shows that the old trust and love, which in his first moments of care and sorrow had failed him, had come back again to the son of Jesse. It is interesting to note that David when addressing the Moabite sovereign speaks of "God" "Elohim," not of Jehovah. This was probably out of deep reverence; an idolator had nothing to do with the awful name by which the Eternal was known to His covenant people--a Name which, as originally uttered, has now passed away from the earth. We read the mystic four letters, but no man, Jew or Gentile, can pronounce the Name of Names. The "Name," however, was not unknown in Moab, for the mystic letters which compose it occur in the inscription of Mesha, dating about 150 years from the days of David's exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab</span>. The position of this place is unknown, but as the word means a <span class="accented">watch tower</span>, it was no doubt some beacon hill in the highlands of Moab on the east of the Dead Sea, and probably in the mountains of Abarim or Pisgah. Here David placed his father and mother under the care of the king of Moab. They had fled from Bethlehem under the combined fear of Saul and the Philistines, but were too old to bear the fatigues of David's life. He therefore asks for a refuge for them with the king of Moab, probably on the ground that Jesse's grandmother, Ruth, was a Moabitess. But as Saul had waged war on Moab (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), the king was probably glad to help one who would keep Saul employed at home. The language of David is remarkable, and is literally, "Let, I pray, my father and my mother come forth with you" (pl.); but no better interpretation has been suggested than that in the A.V.: "Let them come forth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the hold in Mizpeh, to be or dwell with you." <span class="cmt_word">While David was in the hold.</span> Not merely that in the land of Moab, but up to the time when David was settled in Hebron. During all this period David was wandering from one natural fortress to another. <span class="cmt_word">Till I know what God will do for</span> (or to) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. These words show that David had recovered his composure, and was willing calmly to leave everything to the wise disposal of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
