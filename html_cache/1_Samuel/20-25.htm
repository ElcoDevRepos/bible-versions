In ancient Near Eastern culture, the seating arrangement at a banquet or feast was significant, often reflecting one's status and relationship to the host. Sitting by the wall would provide Saul with a strategic vantage point, allowing him to observe the entire room. This setting underscores Saul's paranoia and need for control, as he is increasingly suspicious of those around him, particularly David.<p><b>opposite Jonathan</b><br>Jonathan, Saul's son, is seated across from his father, indicating his importance and close relationship with the king. Jonathan's loyalty to David, however, creates tension in this familial bond. This seating arrangement highlights the internal conflict within Saul's household, as Jonathan's covenant with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>) stands in contrast to Saul's growing animosity towards David. Jonathan's position also foreshadows his role as a mediator between Saul and David.<p><b>and beside Abner</b><br>Abner, the commander of Saul's army and his cousin, is seated next to Saul, signifying his high rank and influence in the kingdom. Abner's presence at the table reflects the military and political dynamics at play, as he is a key figure in Saul's regime. This positioning also emphasizes the loyalty expected from Saul's inner circle, contrasting with David's absence and the underlying threat Saul perceives from him.<p><b>but David&#8217;s place was empty</b><br>David's absence is conspicuous and significant, as he was expected to be present at the king's table. This empty seat symbolizes the growing rift between Saul and David, as well as David's precarious position in the royal court. It also foreshadows the eventual separation and conflict between Saul and David. Theologically, David's absence can be seen as part of God's providential plan, as David is being prepared for his future role as king. This moment also prefigures Christ, who, like David, was rejected by the authorities of His time but was destined for a greater purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was chosen by God but later rejected due to his disobedience.

The verse reminds us that no earthly arrangement can hinder the Lord from advancing His chosen king or fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">David's place was empty.</span>--All took place as the two friends had calculated. Saul's seat was by the wall--then, as now, in the East the highest place of honour was opposite the door. The exact meaning of the phrase, "and Jonathan arose," has been disputed. The LXX. translate here from a different text thus: "He (Saul) went before Jonathan." Keil speaks of this, however, as "the senseless rendering of the Greek Version." The sense in which this difficult passage is understood by Abarbanel and Rashi seems on the whole the best. Understanding that Jonathan had already seated himself after Saul, and that David's absence was observed, "he (Jonathan) arose and seated Abner at Saul's side," that is, in the place left vacant by David's absence, in order that the seat next to Saul might not be empty, he himself having taken the seat on the other side of Saul. This rendering considers <span class= "ital">vayeshev </span>as causative, a verb in the Hipnil conjugation, written defectively, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/10-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, where he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.">2Chronicles 10:2</a>; so Lange, who also quotes Kitto as suggesting an explanation of Saul's expecting David's presence at all at the new moon feast. David, after the strange events at Naioth by Ramah, would suppose (so the king thought) that Saul's feelings towards him had undergone a complete change, and that now, after the ecstasy into which Saul had fallen, he would be once more friendly with him as aforetime.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
