This reflects the ancient practice of seeking signs to discern divine will. Watching for signs was common in the ancient Near East, as seen in other biblical narratives like Gideon's fleece (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>).<p><b>If it goes up the road to its homeland,</b><br>The road to Beth-shemesh was a direct route from the Philistine territory back to Israelite land. The Philistines were testing whether the cows, untrained and separated from their calves, would take the unusual step of heading straight to Israel, indicating divine intervention.<p><b>toward Beth-shemesh,</b><br>Beth-shemesh was a Levitical city in the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>). Its name means "house of the sun," and it was strategically located near the border of Philistine territory. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a significant settlement during the time of the judges and early monarchy.<p><b>it is the LORD who has brought on us this great disaster.</b><br>The Philistines acknowledged the possibility that the calamities they experienced were acts of the God of Israel. This reflects a recognition of Yahweh's power, similar to the acknowledgment by Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>. The "great disaster" refers to the plagues and afflictions that had befallen them since capturing the Ark.<p><b>But if it does not,</b><br>This part of the test was to determine if the events were merely coincidental. The Philistines were seeking to discern between divine causation and random chance, a common concern in ancient cultures when interpreting omens.<p><b>then we will know that it was not His hand that punished us</b><br>The Philistines were attempting to differentiate between divine judgment and natural occurrences. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's hand is often discerned through signs and wonders, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>and that it happened by chance.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of chance or randomness is addressed in various parts of Scripture, often contrasted with divine sovereignty. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a> states, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD," emphasizing God's control over seemingly random events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The people who captured the Ark of the Covenant and experienced plagues as a result.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest representing God's presence, captured by the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-shemesh.htm">Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>A town in Israelite territory where the Ark was to be returned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cows.htm">Cows</a></b><br>Two milk cows were used to carry the Ark back to Israelite territory, serving as a test of divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues.htm">Plagues</a></b><br>The afflictions that struck the Philistines, prompting them to return the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's control over events is evident, as the Philistines sought to determine if their suffering was by His hand or by chance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/testing_god's_will.htm">Testing God's Will</a></b><br>The Philistines' test with the cows illustrates human attempts to discern God's will, reminding us to seek His guidance in our decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_acknowledgment.htm">Repentance and Acknowledgment</a></b><br>The Philistines' decision to return the Ark shows a recognition of God's power, prompting us to acknowledge His authority in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_holiness.htm">God's Presence and Holiness</a></b><br>The Ark symbolizes God's presence, reminding us of the reverence due to Him and the consequences of disregarding His holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/providence_over_chance.htm">Providence Over Chance</a></b><br>The passage challenges the belief in chance, affirming that God orchestrates events according to His purpose.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_6_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 6:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_6_9_God_s_control_over_Philistines.htm">How does 1 Samuel 6:9 demonstrate God's sovereignty over the Philistines' decision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Philistines_view_on_God_s_power.htm">What does the Philistines' test reveal about their understanding of God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_God_s_will_in_uncertainty.htm">How can we discern God's will in uncertain situations, like in 1 Samuel 6:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_events_showing_God_s_guidance.htm">What other biblical instances show God directing outcomes through seemingly random events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_guidance_daily_12.htm">How can we apply the lesson of seeking God's guidance in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_6_9_God_s_control_over_events.htm">What does 1 Samuel 6:9 reveal about God's control over events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_6_9_s_take_on_divine_intervention.htm">How does 1 Samuel 6:9 challenge our understanding of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_1_Samuel_6_9_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 1 Samuel 6:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/any_external_proof_of_ark's_divine_sign.htm">In 1 Samuel 6:9, what evidence outside the text confirms the supposed divine sign for the Ark&#8217;s journey?

By setting up conditions that would naturally prevent the cows from reaching Beth-shemesh, they ensured any successful journey could only be miraculous. The verse highlights humanity&#8217;s innate awareness of divine power, the futility of attributing God&#8217;s clear actions to chance, and the Lord&#8217;s unmatched ability to defend His holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">It was a chance that happened to us.</span>--The priests and diviners were not certain whether the plague had been sent by the offended God of Israel or had visited Philistia in the ordinary course of nature. This strange experiment would satisfy the minds of the Philistine people. If the cows, contrary to their expectation, kept on the road to Bethshemesh, this would be a sign that they were driven and guided by a Divine power, and it would be clear to all that the Ark was a dangerous possession, and that they were well rid of it. They would be assured then that the scourge they were suffering from came from the angry Israelite Deity. If, on the other hand, the animals, left to themselves, returned to their own stalls, which, evidently, the diviners expected would be the case--then the Philistines might safely retain the Ark, being confident that their late sufferings were simply the results of natural causes. It will be remembered (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:">1Samuel 6:7</a>) that these were milch cows, whose calves were shut up in the stall. The diviners felt quite sure that the cows, left to their own instincts, would, unless driven by some Divine power, come back to their young ones in the stall. What the priests and diviners advised was done, and the next two verses (10 and 11) relate how the restoration of the Ark was carried out in the way prescribed above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His own coast,</span> or "border."

It was now a city of the priests, situated in the tribe of Judah, on its northeastern border, next the tribe of Dan, and was the nearest Israelite town to Ekron.
