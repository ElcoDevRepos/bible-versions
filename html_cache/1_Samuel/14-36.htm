The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, and Saul's desire to leave no man alive indicates a total annihilation strategy, which was sometimes seen in ancient warfare. This reflects Saul's impulsive nature and his focus on military victory rather than seeking divine guidance. The command to leave no man alive echoes the herem, or ban, which was a form of warfare where everything was devoted to destruction for God, as seen in Joshua's conquests (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Do what seems good to you,&#8221; the troops replied.</b><br>The troops' response shows their loyalty and willingness to follow Saul's leadership, despite the lack of consultation with God. This reflects the hierarchical nature of ancient Israelite society, where the king's word held significant weight. However, their response also indicates a lack of spiritual discernment, as they do not question the absence of divine guidance. This can be contrasted with the later example of David, who frequently sought God's counsel before battle (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>).<p><b>But the priest said, &#8220;We must consult God here.&#8221;</b><br>The priest's intervention highlights the importance of seeking divine guidance before making significant decisions, especially in matters of war. This reflects the role of the priesthood in Israel as mediators between God and the people, emphasizing the need for spiritual oversight. The priest's insistence on consulting God serves as a reminder of the theocratic nature of Israel, where God was the ultimate authority. This moment foreshadows the later failures of Saul, who often acted without seeking God's will, leading to his eventual rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). The priest's call to consult God aligns with the biblical principle of seeking God's direction, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who often acted impulsively and without seeking God's guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A perennial enemy of Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_troops.htm">The Troops</a></b><br>Saul's army, who were willing to follow his lead without question.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>Likely Ahijah, who served as a spiritual advisor and reminded Saul of the need to seek God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/consulting_god.htm">Consulting God</a></b><br>The act of seeking divine guidance, which was a critical aspect of Israelite decision-making.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god's_guidance.htm">The Importance of Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>Saul's initial plan to attack without consulting God highlights the danger of relying solely on human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_spiritual_advisors.htm">The Role of Spiritual Advisors</a></b><br>The priest's intervention serves as a reminder of the value of having godly counsel in decision-making.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_impulsivity.htm">The Dangers of Impulsivity</a></b><br>Saul's impulsive nature often led to poor decisions, emphasizing the need for patience and discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_collective_wisdom.htm">The Power of Collective Wisdom</a></b><br>The troops' willingness to follow Saul shows the influence leaders have, but also the importance of collective discernment in seeking God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_obedience_to_god.htm">The Necessity of Obedience to God</a></b><br>True success and victory come from aligning with God's plans, not merely human strategies.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_14_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 14:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_14_36_Saul_s_leadership_shown.htm">How does 1 Samuel 14:36 demonstrate Saul's leadership and decision-making process?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_1_Sam_14_view_God_s_will_in_choices.htm">What role does seeking God's will play in decision-making, according to 1 Samuel 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_plans_with_God_s_will_like_1_Sam_14.htm">How can we ensure our plans align with God's will, like in 1 Samuel 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_scripture_stress_consulting_God.htm">What scriptural connections highlight the importance of consulting God before acting?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Saul_s_example_today.htm">How can we apply Saul's example to our leadership roles today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_pursue_Philistines_at_night_Saul.htm">Why did Saul want to pursue the Philistines at night in 1 Samuel 14:36?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_14_36_Saul_s_leadership_insights.htm">What does 1 Samuel 14:36 reveal about Saul's leadership and decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_14_36_Seek_God_s_guidance_first.htm">How does 1 Samuel 14:36 reflect the importance of seeking God's guidance before battle?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_skeptics_reconcile_saul's_death.htm">How do skeptics reconcile 'the LORD put him to death' (1 Chronicles 10:14) with the naturalistic account of Saul's death in 1 Samuel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_honor_saul's_fast_if_it_led_to_sin.htm">Why would God honor Saul's command to fast when it led the soldiers to sin by eating meat with blood (1 Samuel 14:24, 31-33)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_evidence_supports_philistine_panic.htm">What natural or historical evidence supports the sudden 'panic' that supposedly afflicted the Philistine army (1 Samuel 14:15)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_god_change_his_mind_or_not.htm">Does God change his mind?

Saul, flushed with success, wants an all-night assault that would wring every drop of triumph from the Philistines. His men, weary yet loyal, agree by default. A lone priest stands up and reminds everyone that the battle still belongs to the LORD. The verse warns against rushing forward on yesterday&#8217;s blessing, urges continual dependence on God&#8217;s guidance, and foreshadows Saul&#8217;s downfall as a leader who repeatedly acts first and asks later.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Let us go down after the Philistines by night.</span>--In the depth of the night, when the rough feasting on the captured beasts was over, King Saul would have had the bloody work begun afresh, and would have hurried after the flying Philistines, and with a wild butchery have completed the great and signal victory. With the implicit obedience which his soldiers seem ever to have shown him--whether a vow of total abstinence, or a desperate charge, or a wild night attack, or a ruthless bloodshed, was enjoined on them by their stern and gloomy king--the army professed themselves at once ready again to fight. Only one man in that army flushed with victory dared, with the bravery which alone proceeds from righteousness, to withstand the imperious sovereign. The high priest, Ahiah, doubted whether such a wholesale bloodshed as would surely have resulted from the conquering troops of Saul pursuing a dispersed and vanquished enemy, was in accordance with the will of God. No command to exterminate these Philistines had ever been given, and that day, so glorious in the annals of Israel, was wholly due to the special interposition of the Eternal Friend of Israel. Ahiah said, "Let us first inquire of the oracles of God<span class= "ital">"--</span>alluding, of course, to the jewels of Urim and Thummim on his high-priestly ephod.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us go down after the Philistines by night.</span> Saul, conscious that he had prevented the victory from being so decisive as it would otherwise have been, proposes to repair his fault, now that the people have taken food, by continuing the pursuit during the night. The people render the same unquestioning obedience as before, but Ahiah gives counsel that they should first ask the approval of God. <span class="cmt_word">Let us draw near hither.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to the altar which Saul had just set up. Ahiah may have done this because he disapproved of Saul's project, or because generally God ought to be consulted before undertaking anything of importance.
