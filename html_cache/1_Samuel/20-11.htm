Jonathan, the son of King Saul, is speaking to David. The context is a secretive and urgent conversation due to the tension between David and Saul. Jonathan's invitation suggests a level of trust and urgency. In biblical narratives, invitations often precede significant revelations or actions, as seen in other instances like Jesus inviting His disciples to follow Him.<p><b>&#8220;let us go out to the field.&#8221;</b><br>The field represents a place of privacy and safety away from the prying eyes of Saul's court. Fields in ancient Israel were often used for private conversations, as they were open spaces away from the city. This setting is significant as it allows Jonathan and David to speak freely. The field can also symbolize a place of testing and decision, much like the wilderness experiences of biblical figures such as Moses and Jesus.<p><b>So the two of them went out into the field,</b><br>This action demonstrates the mutual trust and commitment between Jonathan and David. Their relationship is a profound example of covenant friendship, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. The act of going out together signifies unity and shared purpose. This moment foreshadows the loyalty and sacrifice that Jonathan will show towards David, even at the cost of his own future as heir to the throne. It also prefigures the sacrificial love of Christ, who calls His followers into a relationship of trust and commitment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

And there Jonathan binds himself with a solemn oath, if Saul's intentions be good, to send a trusty messenger to inform David, but if there be danger, then to come and tell David himself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God.</span> With a few MSS. we must supply the usual formula of an oath: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth." <span class="cmt_word">About tomorrow any time, or the third day.</span> This cumbrous translation arose out of the mistaken idea that the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">tomorrow</span> could only be used in that limited sense. Strictly it signifies the <span class="accented">morning</span>, and is applicable to any morrow. Jonathan fixes one time, and one only, and the passage should be rendered, "By this time on the third morrow." The meeting was to be on the morrow after the second day of the festival, and so on the third morrow after the conversation. The whole may be translated, "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, when by this time on the third morrow I have searched my father, and, behold, there be good for David, if then I send not to thee, and uncover thy ear, Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan." The alternative case is then put, and if the news be evil, Jonathan undertakes himself to be the messenger, and David is to provide for his safety by flight. The concluding prayer that Jehovah might be with David as he had been with Saul contains the same presentiment of David attaining to great power and dignity which is more directly expressed in the following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Come,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
