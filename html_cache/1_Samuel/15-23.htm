Divination involves seeking knowledge or guidance from sources other than God, often through occult means. This comparison highlights the severity of rebellion, as both acts demonstrate a rejection of God's authority and a desire to control one's own destiny. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, Saul's disobedience in not fully carrying out God's command against the Amalekites is seen as a form of rebellion, akin to seeking guidance from false sources.<p><b>and arrogance is like the wickedness of idolatry</b><br>Arrogance, or presumption, is likened to idolatry, which is the worship of false gods. Idolatry was a pervasive issue in ancient Israel, often leading the people away from the worship of Yahweh. Arrogance places one's own judgment above God's, effectively making oneself an idol. Saul's decision to spare King Agag and the best of the livestock reflects this arrogance, as he prioritized his own understanding over God's explicit command. This mirrors the broader biblical theme that pride leads to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>Because you have rejected the word of the LORD</b><br>Rejecting God's word is a serious offense, as it signifies a deliberate choice to ignore divine instruction. In the historical context, Saul was given a clear command through the prophet Samuel, representing God's direct communication. By not fully obeying, Saul rejected not just the message but the authority of God Himself. This act of disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites often faced consequences for turning away from God's commands (<a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>).<p><b>He has rejected you as king.</b><br>The rejection of Saul as king marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history. Saul's kingship was conditional upon his obedience to God, and his failure to comply led to his rejection. This decision by God sets the stage for the rise of David, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). Theologically, this reflects the principle that leadership in God's kingdom is contingent upon faithfulness and obedience. Saul's rejection also foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills God's will and reigns eternally (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to Saul.

The passage calls every believer to wholehearted, humble obedience, recognizing that true worship submits fully to the LORD&#8217;s commands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.</span>--Witchcraft, more literally <span class= "ital">soothsaying </span>or <span class= "ital">divination, </span>was a sin constantly held up to reprobation in the Old Testament. It was the greatest of all the dangers to which Israel was exposed, and was in fact a tampering with the idol-worship of the surrounding nations. Impurity, and an utter lack of all the loftier principles of morality which the one true God and His chosen servants would impress on the peoples of the East, characterised the various systems of idol-worship then current in Syria and the adjacent countries. And Samuel here, in this solemn inspired saying, briefly gives the grounds of the Lord's rejection of His Anointed: "Rebellion," or conscious disobedience to the express commands of the Eternal, in the case of Saul, God's chosen king, was nothing else than the deadly sin of idol-worship, for it set aside the true Master of Israel, and virtually acknowledged another. The next sentence still more emphatically expresses the same thought: "Stubbornness," or "intractableness," is in the eyes of the pure God the same thing as worshipping idols and teraphim. The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">aven, </span>rendered iniquity, literally signifies "nothingness;" it is a word used in the late prophets for an idol (<a href="/hosea/10-8.htm" title="The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.">Hosea 10:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm" title="He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.">Isaiah 66:3</a>). The word in the original translated in the English Version "idolatry," is teraphim. Teraphim were apparently small household gods or idols, venerated as the arbiters of good and evil fortune. In Roman life we find similar idols under the name of "Lares." Teraphim is derived from an unused root, <span class= "ital">taraph, </span>signifying "to live comfortably;" Arabic, <span class= "ital">tarafa: </span>compare the Sanscrit <span class= "ital">trip, </span>and the Greek <span class= "greekheb">???????</span><span class= "ital">. </span>These idols appear to have been small human figures of various sizes. The image in <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13</a> was probably nearly life-size. These teraphim were made generally of silver or of wood. It has been suggested that the teraphim which Rachel stole were images of her ancestors.
