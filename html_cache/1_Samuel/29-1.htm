It was strategically located near the coastal plain, providing a staging ground for military campaigns. The gathering of all Philistine forces indicates a major military operation, reflecting the ongoing conflict between the Philistines and Israelites during the time of Saul. This assembly of forces suggests a unified Philistine front, highlighting their intent to decisively confront Israel. Historically, Aphek is mentioned in other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>, where the Philistines defeated Israel and captured the Ark of the Covenant. This location serves as a reminder of the Philistines' persistent threat to Israel and their desire to dominate the region.<p><b>while Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel</b><br>Jezreel was a fertile valley in northern Israel, known for its strategic importance and agricultural productivity. The spring in Jezreel provided a vital water source for the Israelite army, essential for sustaining troops during military campaigns. This location also served as a defensive position, allowing Israel to monitor Philistine movements. The mention of Jezreel connects to other significant biblical events, such as the story of Naboth's vineyard and the eventual downfall of King Ahab's dynasty. The valley's history is intertwined with themes of judgment and divine intervention. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/29.htm">1 Samuel 29</a>, Israel's encampment at Jezreel sets the stage for the unfolding narrative of David's relationship with the Philistines and his eventual rise to kingship.

Scripture consistently portrays the Philistines as real, formidable foes&#8212;never mythic or symbolic. Their enmity dates back to the period of the judges (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; 16:23). The writer simply picks up the historical storyline from the previous chapter: &#8220;Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies for war to fight against Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-1.htm">1 Samuel 28:1</a>).

It signifies a fort or a strong place. This Aphek was most likely situated in the Plain of Jezreel. Eusebius places it in the neighbourhood of En-dor.<p><span class= "bld">By a fountain which is in Jezreel.</span>--"By a fountain." The LXX. wrongly adds "dor," supposing the spring or fountain to be the well-known En-dor--spring of Dor--but En-dor, we know, lay many miles away from the camp of Saul. This "fountain" has been identified by modern travellers as <span class= "ital">Ain-Jal-d, </span>the Fountain of Goliath, because it was traditionally regarded as the scene of the old combat with the giant. It is a large spring which flows from under the cavern in the rock which forms the base of Gilboa. "There is every reason to regard this as the ancient fountain of Jezreel, where Saul and Jonathan pitched before their last fatal battle, and where, too, in the days of the Crusades, Saladin and the Christians successively encamped."--Robinson, <span class= "ital">Palestine, </span>3:167, 8.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines gathered,</span> etc. The narrative, broken off for the description of Saul's abasement, is again resumed from <a href="/1_samuel/28-1.htm">1 Samuel 28:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek</span>. As we saw on 1 Samuel 4:1, this word, signifying a <span class="accented">fortress</span>, is a very common name for places. If it was the Aphek in Judah there mentioned, David's dismissal would have taken place near Gath, and so soon after Achish joined the Philistine army. Mr. Conder thinks it was the place represented by the modern village <span class="accented">Fuku'a</span>, near Mount Gilboa, in the tribe of Issachar; but as this was distant from Ziklag eighty or ninety miles, it would not have been possible for David to have reached home thence on the third day (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), nor was it probable that his presence with his little army would remain long unnoticed. <span class="cmt_word">A fountain which is in Jezreel.</span> Hebrew, "the fountain." Conder says, "Crossing the valley we see before us the site of Jezreel, on a knoll 500 feet high. The position is very peculiar, for whilst on the north and northeast the slopes are steep and rugged, on the south the ascent is very gradual, and the traveller coming northward is astonished to look down suddenly on the valley with its two springs: one, 'Ain Jalud, welling out from a conglomerate cliff, and forming a pool 100 yards long with muddy borders; the other, the Crusaders' fountain of Tubania" ('Tent-Work,' 1:124). The former is the fountain mentioned here; and it is evident that even now Saul had chosen a strong position for his army. The reading of the Septuagint, <span class="accented">En-dor</span> instead of "the fountain" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">En</span>, or <span class="accented">Ain</span>), is indefensible, as the Israelites were many miles to the southward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/29-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their forces</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124;
