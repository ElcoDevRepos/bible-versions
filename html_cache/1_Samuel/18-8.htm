This moment marks a turning point in Saul's relationship with David, as the king's fear of losing his power becomes evident. The song that incites Saul's fury is a celebration of David's military victories, highlighting the cultural practice of women singing and dancing to honor warriors returning from battle (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-7</a>). Saul's reaction is rooted in his awareness of God's favor shifting from him to David, as previously indicated by Samuel's prophecy (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p><b>&#8220;They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,&#8221; he said,</b><br>The phrase "tens of thousands" is a hyperbolic expression used to emphasize David's success and popularity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such exaggerations were common in songs and poetry to honor heroes. This public recognition of David's achievements exacerbates Saul's fear and jealousy, as it suggests that David is more esteemed by the people than the king himself. This echoes the earlier anointing of David by Samuel, where David is chosen by God to be the future king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;but only thousands to me.</b><br>Saul's comparison of the numbers highlights his perceived diminishing status and the threat he feels from David's rising fame. The contrast between "tens of thousands" and "thousands" underscores Saul's insecurity and the shift in public favor. This sentiment is a reflection of Saul's failure to fully obey God, leading to his rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). Saul's focus on numbers reveals his reliance on human approval rather than divine favor.<p><b>What more can he have but the kingdom?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's rhetorical question reveals his fear that David will usurp his throne. This fear is not unfounded, as David has already been anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). Saul's statement foreshadows the eventual transfer of kingship to David, aligning with God's plan. The tension between Saul and David is a recurring theme, illustrating the struggle between human authority and divine will. This moment also prefigures the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who, like David, is initially rejected but ultimately reigns as the true King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Gerlach, quoted in <span class= "ital">Keil.</span><p>Some years had passed since he first heard from the lips of his old prophet-friend the Divine sentence of his rejection from the kingdom. In that sad period he had doubtless been on the look-out for the one destined by the Invisible King to be his successor. This dread expectation of ruin and dethronement had been a powerful factor in the causes which had led to the unhingement of Saul's mind.

Though many years had passed since Samuel pronounced Saul's deposition, and the choice of another in his place (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>), yet it was not a thing that a king could ever forget. No doubt he had often looked out for signs of the person destined to be his successor; and now, when he had stood powerless before the enemy, a shepherd boy had stepped forth and given him the victory. And this stripling, taken to be his companion in arms, had shown so great qualities that the people reckoned him at ten times Saul's worth. Had Saul been the high-minded man he was when appointed to the kingdom (<a href="/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>), he would have thrust such thoughts from him. But his mind had become cankered with discontent and brooding thoughts, and so <span class="cmt_word">he eyed David from that day and forward.</span> In many nations the eye of an envious man is supposed to have great power of injury.
