This question highlights the divine guidance Samuel receives, as he discerns that none of Jesse's present sons are chosen by God. It underscores the biblical theme that God's choices often defy human expectations, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, where God chooses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.<p><b>&#8220;There is still the youngest,&#8221; Jesse replied,</b><br>David, the youngest son, is not initially considered by his father, Jesse, for the anointing. This reflects the cultural context where the eldest sons were typically given precedence. However, God's selection of David emphasizes the biblical principle that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances, as later stated in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>&#8220;but he is tending the sheep.&#8221;</b><br>David's role as a shepherd is significant, as it foreshadows his future role as the shepherd-king of Israel. Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Israel, requiring diligence and care, qualities that David would later exhibit as king. This imagery is also a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Send for him,&#8221; Samuel replied.</b><br>Samuel's insistence on seeing David demonstrates obedience to God's direction. It also signifies the importance of divine timing and selection, as God's plans often unfold in unexpected ways. This moment marks the beginning of David's journey from obscurity to prominence.<p><b>&#8220;For we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the urgency and importance of the occasion. In ancient Near Eastern culture, meals were significant social events, often marking covenantal or celebratory moments. The delay of the meal until David's arrival highlights the honor and divine favor being bestowed upon him, setting the stage for his anointing as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord, tasked with anointing the next king of Israel.

The command from the Eternal Friend to come and anoint "the son of Jesse of Bethlehem" had been definite, but the sons of Jesse had passed before him, and no sign had been vouch-safed to him indicating that God had chosen one of these youths of whom the father was so fond; so the seer asks, "Are these all thy children?"<p><span class= "bld">There remaineth yet the youngest.</span>--Why David was kept in the background is uncertain. He, clearly, was different to the stalwart band of elder brothers who were grouped round their father. Although fair to look on, his beauty was of a very different type to that of his brothers, probably, compared with Saul and his own brothers, little of stature, with reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. His father and the men in the village thought less of him than of his dark, tall brothers: at all events, Jesse thought him of too little account to present to Samuel. But, as so often, God's thoughts are not our thoughts, and in a moment Samuel saw that in the ruddy shepherd boy--small of stature, and held of little account in his father's house--he beheld the future king of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are here all thy children?</span> The word literally is lads, <span class="accented">na'arim.</span> The elder sons must have been nearly or quite grown up, but David was probably a mere boy, and as such had not been thought worthy of an invitation, but had been left with the servants keeping the sheep. The prophet now orders him to be summoned, and marks his value in God's sight by saying, <span class="cmt_word">We will not sit down till he come hither.</span> The verb literally means, <span class="accented">we will not surround, i.e.</span> the table, though at this time the Jews did sit at meals, instead of reclining on couches, as in the days of Amos and our Lord. We gather, moreover, from Samuel's words that the selection of the son that was to be anointed took place while the preparations were being made for the feast. At the prophet's command David is fetched from the flock, which was probably near the house, and on his arrival the prophet sees a <span class="cmt_word">ruddy</span> boy, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> red-haired, correctly rendered in the Vulgate <span class="accented">rufus</span>, the colour loved by all painters of manly beauty, and, from the delicacy of complexion which accompanies it, especially admired in the East, where men are generally dark-haired and sallow-faced.
