In the context of 1 Samuel, David is the "my lord" referred to by Abigail, who recognizes God's hand in David's life. The promises likely refer to God's covenant with David, which includes his future kingship over Israel. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) and later to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The phrase underscores the certainty of divine promises, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>and when He has appointed you ruler over Israel</b><br>This part of the verse anticipates David's future role as king, a position he was anointed for by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. The term "appointed" indicates divine selection and ordination, emphasizing that David's kingship is part of God's sovereign plan. Historically, this reflects the transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy in Israel, with David as a central figure. Theologically, David is a type of Christ, the ultimate ruler and King, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). David's kingship foreshadows the eternal reign of Jesus, the Son of David, fulfilling the messianic prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently on the run from King Saul.

This she, in common with other religious persons of the people, had doubtless heard through the Prophetic Schools. We may fairly suppose that not a few of the pupils of Samuel and his associates had been, when the first meeting of David with Abigail took place, for a considerable time working as teachers and preachers throughout the land. It is most likely that the synagogue, or something out of which the synagogue sprang--some kind of assembly for prayer to the God of Israel for instruction and exhortation--had already taken root among the people. The "sons of the prophets," we may still with fair probability assume, were the first Teachers--the first <span class= "ital">rabbis </span>in Israel. It must be remembered that at this time, and even before the murder of the priests at Nob, the central Sanctuary exercised comparatively small influence over the religious life of the people; even the Ark of the Covenant never seems to nave been kept there. The religious life, when Samuel had grown up to manhood, had well-nigh died out of the people.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for my lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
