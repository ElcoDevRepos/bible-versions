Samuel served as a bridge between the period of the judges and the establishment of the monarchy. His role as a prophet is significant, as he was chosen by God to anoint the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. This divine communication underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where God directly guides His chosen leaders.<p><b>Listen to the voice of the people</b><br>Here, God instructs Samuel to heed the demands of the Israelites. This reflects a pivotal moment in Israel's history, where the people desire to transition from a theocracy to a monarchy. The request for a king was influenced by the surrounding nations, which had centralized leadership. This phrase highlights the tension between divine guidance and human desire for conformity to worldly systems.<p><b>in all that they say to you</b><br>God's instruction to Samuel to listen to the people in all they say suggests a comprehensive understanding of their demands. This reflects God's allowance for human free will, even when it diverges from His ideal plan. It also sets the stage for the consequences that will follow Israel's choice, as detailed in the subsequent chapters.<p><b>For it is not you they have rejected</b><br>This phrase reassures Samuel that the people's demand for a king is not a personal rejection of his leadership. Samuel had faithfully served as a judge and prophet, and this statement clarifies that the issue lies deeper than dissatisfaction with his governance. It points to a spiritual problem within the nation.<p><b>but they have rejected Me as their king</b><br>The core issue is revealed: the people's request for a human king signifies a rejection of God's kingship. This reflects a recurring theme in Israel's history, where the people often turned away from God's direct rule in favor of human leadership or idolatry. This rejection is prophetic of the struggles Israel will face under human kings, and it foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, the true King, by His own people. The desire for a king is a type of the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel.

This deliberate complaint on the part of Israel is directed not against you, the judge, but against Me, the invisible King.

Here, as is not unfrequent in the Divine records, we have a corner of the veil which hangs between the creature and the Creator lifted for a moment. We see how sadly possible it is for man in the exercise of his perfect freewill to mar the glorious work arranged for him by his God. We see too in the records of such a transaction as this (see <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>) how all was foreseen by the King of heaven, and we catch sight of the sorrowful regret--if we may use the term--of the Creator for the perverse folly of His creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In prayer then the answer came to him that the request of the people must be granted, however wrongly it had been urged.
