Ahimelech, the priest, was a descendant of Eli, the high priest whose lineage was prophesied to face judgment (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-36</a>). David's visit to Nob marks a critical moment in his life as he flees from King Saul. This event foreshadows the eventual destruction of Nob by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>), highlighting the tension between Saul and David. The presence of the tabernacle in Nob signifies the city's spiritual importance, and David's interaction with Ahimelech underscores his reliance on divine guidance during his flight.<p><b>And when Ahimelech met David, he trembled and asked him,</b><br>Ahimelech's trembling indicates his awareness of the political tension between Saul and David. As a priest, Ahimelech would have been concerned about the implications of aiding David, who was known to be a fugitive. This reaction reflects the fear and uncertainty prevalent among the Israelites due to Saul's erratic behavior and the growing support for David as the anointed future king. Ahimelech's fear also suggests the potential consequences of being associated with David, as Saul's wrath was unpredictable and often violent.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?&#8221;</b><br>David's solitary arrival was unusual for someone of his status, as he was typically accompanied by a retinue. Ahimelech's question highlights the abnormality of the situation and his suspicion of David's intentions. In the cultural context, traveling alone could imply secrecy or urgency, raising concerns about David's motives. This moment foreshadows David's reliance on subterfuge and strategic thinking throughout his life. Theologically, David's isolation can be seen as a type of Christ, who often withdrew to solitary places for prayer and faced moments of abandonment, particularly during His passion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks his life.

Now he seeks refuge in Nob, the city where the tabernacle stands (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Nob is only a few miles north of Jerusalem, so David&#8217;s arrival signals that he is moving closer to enemy territory yet closer to the presence of God.<p>&#8226; Scripture places every movement of David within God&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>), underscoring that his steps to Nob are neither random nor accidental.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Ahimelech the priest</b><p>&#8226; Ahimelech is the great-grandson of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), serving as high priest.

Every phrase reveals God&#8217;s providence: the precise location near the tabernacle, the presence of a high priest from Eli&#8217;s line, the trembling that signals looming danger, and the probing questions that test allegiance. David may appear alone, yet the Lord is orchestrating events to preserve His anointed, demonstrate mercy through the priesthood, and foreshadow the greater King who would likewise be rejected, misunderstood, and ultimately vindicated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Then came David to Nob.</span>--Before leaving his native land, David determined once more to see, and if practicable to take counsel with, the old high priest of Israel, with whom, no doubt, in the past years of his close connection with Samuel, he had had frequent and intimate communion. He hoped, too, in that friendly and powerful religious centre to provide himself and his few companions with arms and other necessaries for his exile; nor is it improbable that he purposed, through the friendly high priest, to make some inquiry of the Divine oracle, the Urim and Thuinmim, concerning his doubtful future. The unexpected presence of Doeg, the powerful and unscrupulous servant of Saul, at the sanctuary, no doubt hurried him away in hot haste across the frontier.<p>The town of Nob, situated between Anathoth and Jerusalem--about an hour's ride from the latter--has been with great probability identified with the "village of Esau," El-Isaurizeb, a place bearing all the marks of an ancient town, with its many marble columns and ancient stones. There, in these latter days of Saul, "stood the last precious relic of the ancient nomadic times--the tabernacle of the wanderings, round which, since the fall of Shiloh, had dwelt the descendants of the house of Eli. It was a little colony of priests; no less than eighty-five persons ministered there in the white linen dress of the priesthood, and all their families and herds were gathered round them. The priest was not so ready to befriend as the prophet (we allude to David's reception by Samuel at Naioth by Ramah, 1 Samuel 19). As the solitary fugitive, famished and unarmed, stole up the mountain side, he met with but a cold welcome from the cautious and courtly Ahimelech."--Stanley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 12<p><span class= "bld">To Ahimelech the priest.</span>--He was the great grandson of Eli, thus--<p>Died at Shiloh after news of capture of Ark,<p>Eli<p>Phinehas<p>Ahitub<p>Ichabod<p>Ahimelech<p>Abiathar.<p>Slain by Philistines in battle<p>Reign of Saul--High Priest, . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came David to Nob.</span> Nob means a <span class="accented">knoll</span> or <span class="accented">hill</span>, and apparently was situated a little to the north of Jerusalem on the road leading to Gath. The ark had evidently been removed thither by Saul early in his reign, after it had remained for twenty years in the house of Abinadab; and as eighty-five priests wearing an ephod were murdered there by Doeg at Saul's command (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>), it is plain that the worship of Jehovah had been restored by him with something of its old splendour. And this agrees with Saul's character. At the commencement of his reign we find Ahiah with him as high priest, and even when he fell his excuse was the necessity for performing the public rites of religion (<a href="/1_samuel/15-15.htm">1 Samuel 15:15</a>). But with him the king's will was first, the will of Jehovah second; and while he restores God's public worship as part of the glory of his reign, he ruthlessly puts the priests with their wives and families to death when he supposes that they have given aid to his enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David.</span> More literally, "went trembling to meet David." Ahiah, described as high priest in <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>, was either dead or, more probably, was a younger brother, who, while Ahimelech remained with the ark, acted as high priest at the camp for Saul, especially in consulting God for him by means of the ephod with the breastplate. <span class="cmt_word">Why art thou alone?</span> Nevertheless, in <a href="/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a> our Lord speaks of those "who were with David," and the "young men" are mentioned in vers. 4, 5. While David went alone to consult Ahimelech, that his visit might be kept quite secret, he had taken a few of his servants with him, and had left them somewhere in the neighbourhood, or even, more probably, had instructed some one to meet him with such men as he could collect. The arrival of the king's son-in-law without an escort would naturally strike the high priest as strange, and therefore as alarming. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Nob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1428;&#1489;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#7687;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5011.htm">Strong's 5011: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nob -- a priestly city, perhaps also a place North of Jerusalem</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ahimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_288.htm">Strong's 288: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahimelech -- 'brother of a king', an Israelite name, also a Hittite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">And when Ahimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_288.htm">Strong's 288: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahimelech -- 'brother of a king', an Israelite name, also a Hittite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">met</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(liq&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7122.htm">Strong's 7122: </a> </span><span class="str2">To encounter, befall</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he trembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1512;&#1463;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;ra&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2729.htm">Strong's 2729: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shudder with terror, to fear, to hasten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
