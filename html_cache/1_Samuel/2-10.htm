Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a warrior who fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The imagery of shattering suggests complete destruction, similar to the fate of the Philistines and other enemies of Israel. This reflects the biblical theme that no power can withstand God&#8217;s might (<a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>).<p><b>He will thunder from heaven against them.</b><br>Thunder is often associated with God's voice and power (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>). This phrase suggests divine intervention and judgment, reminiscent of God&#8217;s presence at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The imagery of thunder signifies God's overwhelming power and authority over creation, reinforcing His ability to execute judgment.<p><b>The LORD will judge the ends of the earth</b><br>This phrase points to God's universal sovereignty and justice. It foreshadows the eschatological judgment where God will judge all nations (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). The "ends of the earth" indicates that no one is beyond God's reach, highlighting His omnipresence and omnipotence.<p><b>and will give power to His king.</b><br>This anticipates the establishment of a monarchy in Israel, fulfilled in the anointing of Saul and later David. It also points to the Messianic expectation of a king from David&#8217;s line who will rule with divine authority (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This king is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is given all authority (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>He will exalt the horn of His anointed.&#8221;</b><br>The "horn" symbolizes strength and victory (<a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>). "His anointed" refers to the king chosen by God, initially David, and prophetically the Messiah, Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>). This phrase underscores the divine empowerment and exaltation of the Messiah, who will triumph over all enemies and establish an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>The mother of Samuel, who offers this prayer of praise and prophecy after dedicating her son to the Lord's service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the ultimate judge and source of power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed.htm">The Anointed</a></b><br>Refers prophetically to the future king of Israel, and ultimately to the Messiah, Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolizes the entirety of the world, indicating the universal scope of God's judgment and reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The realm from which God thunders, signifying His divine authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>God is the ultimate judge who will shatter those who oppose Him.

When the heavens rumble, no one wonders who is speaking.<p>&#8226; At Sinai the thunder made Israel tremble (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16&#8211;19</a>).

Jewish expositors, too, have generally interpreted these words as a prophecy of King Messiah. The words received a partial fulfilment in the splendid reigns of David and Solomon; but the pious Jew looked on the golden halo which surrounded these great reigns as but a pale reflection of the glory which would accompany King Messiah when He should appear.<p>This is the first passage in the Old Testament which speaks of "His Anointed," or "His Messiah." The LXX. render the words "<span class= "ital">Christou autou."</span><p>This song was soon evidently well known in Israel. The imagery, and in several passages the very words, are reproduced in the Psalms. See <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>A and B at the end of this Book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The adversaries.</span> In the <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> the nouns are again sing., though the verb is pl., showing that they are to be taken collectively. Lit. the translation is, "Jehovah they shall be broken in pieces, whoever it be that contendeth with him;" the word having reference to contentions in a court of law, and the whole verse keeping the administration of justice in view. It proceeds, "Upon him he shall thunder in heaven;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah, seated on his throne in heaven, shall, as the supreme Judge, utter the sentence; and thunder was to the Hebrew God's voice. <span class="cmt_word">He shall judge the ends of the earth,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole earth up to its remotest quarters. The last distich is remarkable. It is a distinct prophecy of David's kingdom, and of the king as the anointed one, but looking onwards to the Messiah, David's greater Son. So distinct a reference to a king before a king existed has made Ewald and others regard the whole hymn as an interpolation of later times. But already Hannah's thoughts had risen to a higher level than the fortunes of the literal Israel. In claiming for Jehovah, her covenant God, the righteous government of the whole world, she prepares our minds for the corresponding thought of Jehovah being the universal Saviour. Very probably the whole national mind was set upon having a king to enable them to make head against the Philistines long before, under Samuel, the desire became so strong as to be irresistible. The thought of a king was in no respect alien from the Jewish commonwealth (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>). They had wished Gideon to hold this office (<a href="/judges/8-22.htm">Judges 8:22</a>); Jotham's parable in <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>. described the nation as eager to be thus governed, but the better minds as bent on declining so dangerous a preeminence. There is very much to prove that the nation had come to regard the appointment of a king as an eventual necessity, however long delayed. But not here only, but everywhere, the Jewish mind was constantly brooding upon the future. Hannah does no more than every patriarch and saint and prophet of the old dispensation. Prophecies such as that in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> filled the hearts of all alike. And though the present longings of the nation for a king make Hannah's words not unnatural even in their lower sense, yet the truer exposition is that which acknowledges in Israel a people raised up for a special purpose, and the bestowal by God upon its seers for the carrying out of this purpose of the gift of prophecy. And it was this extraordinary gift which bent and shaped the mind of the nation, and filled it with future aspirations; and not a causeless state of the national mind which, excited by vague hopes, made men from time to time give utterance to anticipations which by some strange coincidence always came true. <p> CHAPTER 2:11-26 SAMUEL'S MINISTRATIONS AT SHILOH (vers. 11-21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those who oppose</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124;
