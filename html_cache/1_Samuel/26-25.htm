Saul, the first king of Israel, had been pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne. The use of "my son" indicates a personal and affectionate relationship, despite the conflict. This blessing is significant as it shows Saul's recognition of David's future role and God's favor upon him. The blessing also echoes the patriarchal blessings found in Genesis, where fathers would bless their sons, often with prophetic insight.<p><b>You will accomplish great things and will surely prevail.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's words here are prophetic, acknowledging David's future success and kingship. This aligns with God's earlier anointing of David through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The phrase "accomplish great things" can be seen as a foreshadowing of David's military victories, his establishment of Jerusalem as the capital, and his role in uniting the tribes of Israel. The assurance that David "will surely prevail" underscores the divine favor and protection over David's life, reminiscent of God's promises to the patriarchs and to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).<p><b>So David went on his way,</b><br>David's departure signifies his continued reliance on God's timing and protection rather than taking matters into his own hands. This moment is a testament to David's faith and patience, as he refrains from harming Saul, despite having the opportunity. It reflects the biblical principle of waiting on the Lord and trusting in His plans, as seen in Psalms and Proverbs (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>and Saul returned home.</b><br>Saul's return home marks a temporary cessation of his pursuit of David. This moment of peace is short-lived, as Saul's internal struggles and disobedience to God eventually lead to his downfall. The phrase highlights the transient nature of Saul's repentance and the ongoing tension between his actions and God's will. Saul's return also sets the stage for the eventual transition of power to David, fulfilling God's plan for Israel's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
