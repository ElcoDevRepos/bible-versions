Rising early signifies readiness and obedience, a common biblical theme (e.g., Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>). It reflects David's leadership and the discipline of his men, who were loyal and prepared to follow him.<p><b>to return to the land of the Philistines</b><br>David had sought refuge with Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, and was given Ziklag as a dwelling place (<a href="/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-6</a>). This return highlights the complex relationship between David and the Philistines, who were Israel's enemies. It underscores David's strategic acumen in navigating political tensions while maintaining his integrity and loyalty to Israel.<p><b>And the Philistines went up to Jezreel</b><br>Jezreel, a fertile valley in northern Israel, was strategically significant. The Philistines' movement towards Jezreel indicates their military intentions against Israel. This sets the stage for the impending battle where Saul and his sons would meet their fate (<a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-6</a>).

But they little thought in how sore a danger their wives and children and homes were at this juncture.
