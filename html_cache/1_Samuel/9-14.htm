Saul, the son of Kish, is on a mission to find his father's lost donkeys, accompanied by his servant. The journey to the city, likely Ramah, is divinely orchestrated, as God has already informed Samuel of Saul's coming (<a href="/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-16</a>). The act of "going up" is both literal, as cities were often built on elevated ground for defense, and symbolic, representing an ascent towards a divine appointment. This journey foreshadows Saul's rise to kingship, as God uses ordinary circumstances to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and as they were entering it</b><br>The timing of their entrance is crucial. It highlights God's providence and perfect timing, as Saul and his servant arrive just as Samuel is about to perform a significant religious duty. This moment underscores the theme of divine guidance and intervention, a recurring motif in the narrative of Israel's history. The entrance into the city marks a transition from the mundane search for donkeys to a pivotal moment in Israel's monarchy.<p><b>there was Samuel coming toward them</b><br>Samuel, the last judge and a prophet, plays a central role in this narrative. His approach signifies the meeting of divine purpose with human action. Samuel's presence is a fulfillment of God's revelation to him about Saul's arrival (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>). This encounter is not coincidental but orchestrated by God, demonstrating His sovereignty. Samuel's role as a mediator between God and Israel is highlighted here, as he is about to anoint Saul as the first king of Israel.<p><b>on his way up to the high place</b><br>The "high place" refers to a site of worship, often located on elevated terrain. In ancient Israel, high places were used for sacrifices and religious ceremonies before the establishment of the temple in Jerusalem. Samuel's journey to the high place indicates his role as a spiritual leader and his commitment to worship and sacrifice. This setting underscores the religious and cultural context of the time, where high places were central to communal worship. The high place also symbolizes a meeting point between God and man, foreshadowing Saul's anointing and the establishment of the monarchy as part of God's plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys.

At the moment of their meeting the seer has come forth from his house on the way to the solitary sacred heights of Ramah, the city of his residence, where he sacrifices on the altar to Jahveh, or is wont to partake of a sacred sacrificial repast with some of his closest friends. He at once desires to take Saul also with him, telling him beforehand how unimportant was the immediate object of his inquiries, and that the matter was already settled; but that for him and his whole house was reserved a very different and far better destiny in Israel. And though Saul, in his unassuming simplicity, would fain waive the honour which is obscurely hinted (so little does he yet know his better self), the holy man, more discerning, takes him with him to the sacrificial meal, which is already prepared; nay, assigns him the place of honour among the thirty guests before invited, while he is served with a portion of the sacrificial meat, put by, as it were, specially for him: for in like manner a portion other and higher than that of ordinary men had been long reserved for him by heaven."--<span class= "ital">Ewald.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they were come into.</span> More correctly, "As they were going into the city."
