Crying out to the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often signifying a turning point where the people recognize their need for divine intervention. This act of crying out is not just a plea for help but also an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and mercy. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God responds to the cries of His people when they turn back to Him.<p><b>&#8216;We have sinned,</b><br>The admission of sin is crucial in the process of repentance. In the biblical context, sin is not merely a moral failing but a breach of the covenant with God. This acknowledgment is a necessary step for reconciliation with God. The Israelites' confession here is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where confession leads to restoration, such as in the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12) and the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<p><b>for we have forsaken the LORD</b><br>Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate turning away from God and His commandments. This phrase highlights the Israelites' unfaithfulness and the breaking of their covenant relationship with God. Throughout the Old Testament, forsaking God often leads to dire consequences, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges. This forsaking is contrasted with the call to love and serve God with all one's heart, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.<p><b>and served the Baals and Ashtoreths.</b><br>The Baals and Ashtoreths were Canaanite deities, representing fertility and nature. Serving these gods was a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This phrase underscores the syncretism that plagued Israel, where they adopted the religious practices of surrounding nations. The worship of Baal and Ashtoreth often involved immoral practices, which were abhorrent to the LORD. This idolatry is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to their downfall and exile.<p><b>Now deliver us from the hands of our enemies,</b><br>This plea for deliverance is a common motif in the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as a deliverer and savior. The Israelites' request for deliverance is not just a desire for physical safety but also a return to divine favor. This reflects the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance found in the Book of Judges. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from sin and death.<p><b>that we may serve You.&#8217;</b><br>The desire to serve God indicates a renewed commitment to the covenant relationship. Serving God involves obedience, worship, and devotion, aligning with the Shema's call to love God with all one's heart, soul, and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). This phrase signifies a turning away from idolatry and a return to exclusive worship of the LORD. It echoes the call to holiness and faithfulness that is central to the identity of God's people throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, who served as a prophet and leader during a transitional period in Israel's history.
