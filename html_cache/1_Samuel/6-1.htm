It symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel. The ark was central to Israelite worship and was kept in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. Its capture by the Philistines was a significant event, indicating a period of spiritual decline for Israel. The ark's presence among the Philistines demonstrated God's sovereignty and power, even outside Israel.<p><b>had been in the land of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a confederation of sea peoples who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. They were often in conflict with the Israelites. The capture of the ark by the Philistines occurred after the Israelites were defeated in battle at Ebenezer (1 Samuel 4). The ark was taken to several Philistine cities, including Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron, causing plagues and distress wherever it went. This movement of the ark among the Philistine cities highlights the futility of their attempts to control or benefit from the ark, as it brought calamity rather than blessing.<p><b>seven months</b><br>The duration of seven months signifies a complete period of time, often associated with divine intervention or judgment in biblical literature. During these months, the Philistines experienced severe afflictions, including tumors and a plague of mice, as a direct consequence of possessing the ark. This period of suffering led the Philistines to recognize the power of the God of Israel and seek a way to return the ark to its rightful place. The number seven frequently appears in the Bible, symbolizing completeness or perfection, and in this context, it underscores the totality of the Philistines' experience with the ark.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_lord.htm">The Ark of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and had captured the Ark during a battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_philistines.htm">The Land of the Philistines</a></b><br>The territory where the Philistines lived, which included five major cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_months.htm">Seven Months</a></b><br>The duration for which the Ark remained with the Philistines, during which they experienced plagues and misfortune.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose presence was symbolized by the Ark and who demonstrated His power over the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>The Ark's presence in Philistine territory demonstrates God's sovereignty over all nations.

The princes determined, therefore, to restore it to Israel, and convened <span class="cmt_word">the priests and the diviners,</span> that they might advise them as to the manner in which this purpose should be best carried out, lest some error or want of due reverence might only serve to increase their sufferings. It would be the duty of the priests to see that the proper ceremonial was observed in moving the ark, while the diviners would decide what day and hour and special method would be lucky. The importance of the diviner, <span class="accented">qosem</span>, is shown by his being mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a> in an enumeration of the leading orders in the state. He is placed there between the prophet and the elder or senator; but the A.V., displeased perhaps at finding one who practised a forbidden art nevertheless described as practically so valued, translates the word <span class="accented">prudent.</span> Literally it means a <span class="accented">divider</span> or <span class="accented">partitioner</span>, because it was his office to separate things into the two classes of lucky and unlucky. <span class="cmt_word">Tell us wherewith,</span> etc, Though this translation is tenable, the right rendering is probably <span class="accented">how</span>. The princes did not assume that gifts must accompany the ark, but inquired generally as to the best method of restoring it. So the answer of the priests and diviners is not merely that expiatory offerings are to be made, but that the ark is to be sent back in such a way as to give proof that Jehovah had intervened, or the contrary (vers. 7, 8, 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the ark</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_727.htm">Strong's 727: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chest, ark</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had been</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
