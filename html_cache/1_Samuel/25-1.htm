His death marked the end of an era of direct divine leadership through judges. Samuel's role in anointing both Saul and David as kings highlights his importance in the transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy. His death would have been a moment of national mourning, as he was a respected leader who had guided Israel spiritually and politically.<p><b>all Israel gathered to mourn for him</b><br>The gathering of "all Israel" indicates the widespread respect and influence Samuel had across the tribes. Mourning customs in ancient Israel included lamentation, fasting, and wearing sackcloth. This collective mourning underscores the unity of the nation in recognizing Samuel's impact. It also reflects the cultural importance of communal expressions of grief for significant leaders.<p><b>and they buried him at his home in Ramah</b><br>Ramah, Samuel's birthplace and home, was located in the hill country of Ephraim. It was a central location for his ministry and served as a base for his circuit as a judge. The burial at his home signifies a return to his roots and the honor given to him by being laid to rest in his own land. This practice was common in ancient Israel, where family burial sites were often located on ancestral property.<p><b>Then David set out and went down to the Wilderness of Paran</b><br>David's departure to the Wilderness of Paran follows the tension with Saul, who sought his life. The Wilderness of Paran is a desert region south of Judah, providing a strategic location for David to evade Saul's pursuit. This movement also reflects David's status as a fugitive and his reliance on God for protection. The wilderness experience is a recurring theme in the Bible, often symbolizing a place of testing and preparation, as seen in the lives of Moses and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was instrumental in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Immediately, David journeys deeper into desert exile, trusting God&#8217;s leading while political uncertainty swirls. The verse links past faithfulness with future promise, reminding readers that even when notable servants die, God&#8217;s redemptive plan marches on.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And Samuel died.</span>--At this period--namely, about the time when Saul and David met at En-gedi--died Samuel, full of years and honour--perhaps rather than <span class= "ital">honours, </span>for a long time the old prophet had lived apart from the court, and alienated from the king he had chosen and anointed. Since Moses, none so great as Samuel had arisen. Briefly to recapitulate his work: his influence had in great measure restored the Law of Moses to the affections of the people. Before his time, the words and traditions which the great lawgiver, amidst the supernatural terrors of Sinai, had with some success impressed upon the great nomadic tribe of the Beni-Israel were almost forgotten; and the people among whom, for a long period, no really great leader had sprung up were becoming rapidly mixed up, and soon would have been hardly distinguished from the warlike tribes of Canaan in the neighbouring countries. But Samuel, aided by his great natural genius, but far more by the Glorious Arm, on which he leaned with a changeless trust from childhood to extreme old age, quickened into life again the dying traditions of the race, and taught them who they--the down-trodden Israelites--really were--<span class= "ital">the chosen of God. </span>He restored the forgotten laws of Moses, by the keeping of which they once became great and powerful, and by the creation of an earthly monarchy he welded into one the separate interests of the twelve divisions of the race; so that from Dan to Beersheba there was but one chief, one standard. But his greatest work was the foundation of the Prophetic Schools, in which men were trained and educated carefully, with the view of the pupils becoming in their turn the teachers and guides of the people. (These schools, which exercised so great an influence upon the future of Israel, and their especial character have been already discussed.)<p><span class= "bld">And all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him.</span>--"When the hour of his death came, we are told, with a peculiar emphasis of expression, that <span class= "ital">all </span>the Israelites--not one portion or fragment only, as might have been expected in that time of division and confusion--were gathered together round him who had been the father of all alike, and lamented him, and buried him, not in any sacred spot or secluded sepulchre, but in the midst of the home which he had consecrated only by his own long, unblemished career in his house at Ramah."--Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 18 Josephus makes especial mention of the public funeral honours paid to the great prophet. "They wept for him a very great number of days, not looking on it as a sorrow for the death of another man, but as that in which they were all concerned. He was a righteous man, and gentle in his nature, and on that account he was very dear to God."--<span class= "ital">Antt. vi.</span> 13, ? 5. F. W. Krummacher beautifully writes on this public lamentation. "It was as if from the noble star, as long as it shone in the heaven of the Holy Land, though veiled by clouds, there streamed a mild, beneficial light over all Israel; now the light was extinguished in Israel." It is probable by "in his house," the court or garden attached to the prophet's house is signified. To have buried him literally in his house would have occasioned perpetual ceremonial defilement. We read also of Manasseh the king being "buried in his own house" (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-20.htm" title="So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 33:20</a>), which is explained in <a href="/2_kings/21-18.htm" title="And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 21:18</a> by the words, "in the garden of his own house." In modern times Samuel's grave is pointed out in a cave underneath the floor of the Mahommedan Mosque on Nebi Samuel, a lofty peak above Gibeon, which still bears his honoured name. There is, however, a tradition that his remains--or what purported to be his remains--were removed with royal pomp from Ramah to Constantinople by the Emperor Arcadius, at the beginning of the fifth century.<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness of Paran.</span>--The LXX. (Vatican) read "Maon" instead of "Paran," not conceiving it probable that the scene of David's camp would be so far removed from Maon and Carmel, the localities where the following events took place. "Paran" is properly the south of the Arabian peninsula, west of Sinai; "but it seems to have given its name to the vast extent of pasture and barren land now known as the Desert of El Tih. Of this the wilderness of Judah and Beersheba would virtually form part, without the borders being strictly defined. The LXX. emendation, therefore, is quite unnecessary.--<span class= "ital">Dean Payne Smith.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel died.</span> According to Josephus, Samuel had for eighteen years been contemporaneous with Saul's kingdom. If this calculation, which probably rests upon some Jewish tradition, be at all correct, we must include the years of Samuel's judgeship in the sum total of Saul's reign (see on 1 Samuel 13:1), as evidently his fall was now fast approaching. Samuel's life marked the beginning of the second age of Israelite history (<a href="/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>). Moses had given the people their law, but Samuel in the schools of the prophets provided for them that education without which a written law was powerless, and called forth also and regulated that living energy in the prophetic order which, claiming an all but equal authority, modified and developed it, and continually increased its breadth and force, until the last prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, with supreme and Divine power reenacted it as the religion of the whole world. And as neither his educational institutions nor the prophetic order, whose ordinary duties were closely connected with these schools, could have flourished without internal quietness and security, Samuel also established the Jewish monarchy, which was ideally also necessary, because the Messiah must not only be priest and prophet, but before all things a king (<a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1, 6</a>; <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). And side by side with the kingdom he lived on to see the military successes of the first king, and the firm establishment of the royal power; but to witness also the development of that king into a despot, the overclouding of his mind with fits of madness, the designation of his successor, the probation of that successor by manifold trials, his ripening fitness under them to be the model of a theocratic king, and his growth in power so as practically to be now safe from all Saul's evil purposes. And so in the fulness of time Samuel died, and all Israel gathered together and made lamentation for him (see <a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and buried him in his house.</span> The tomb at present shown as that of Samuel is situated upon a lofty hill, the identification of which with Ramah is very uncertain. Probably he was buried not actually in his house, as that would lead to perpetual ceremonial defilement (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>; <a href="/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>), but in some open spot in his garden (comp. <a href="/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-20.htm">2 Chronicles 33:20</a>). So Joab was buried in his own house (<a href="/1_kings/2-34.htm">1 Kings 2:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At Ramah.</span> Thenius thinks that the prophets shared with the kings the right of intramural burial. DAVID IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN (vers. 1-42). DAVID ASKS A GIFT OF THE WEALTHY NABAL AND IS REFUSED (vers. 1-13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose.</span> This is not to be connected with the death of Samuel, as though David had now lost a protector. But as he had fully 600 men with him, and his force was continually increasing, it was necessary for him to roam over a wide extent of country in order to obtain supplies of food. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Paran.</span> Paran strictly is a place in the southernmost part of the peninsula of Arabia, a little to the west of Mount Sinai; but there can be little doubt that it gave its name to the vast extent of pasture and barren land now known as the desert of El-Tih (see <a href="/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>). Of this the wildernesses of Judah and Beersheba would virtually form parts without the borders being strictly defined. We need not therefore read "the wilderness of Maon," with the Septuagint and many commentators. On the contrary, we have seen that the hold in ch. 24:22 was the hill Hachilah in that neighbourhood, and David now moved southward towards the edge of this vast wilderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">died,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
