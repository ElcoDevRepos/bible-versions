Saul, the first king of Israel, was appointed by God through Samuel. His response here is significant as it reflects his attempt to justify his actions. Saul's leadership is often marked by his struggle to fully obey God's commands, which ultimately leads to his downfall.<p><b>The troops brought them from the Amalekites</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe and long-standing enemies of Israel. God commanded Saul to completely destroy them as a form of divine judgment for their past actions against Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). Saul's mention of the troops suggests a deflection of responsibility, indicating a failure in leadership and obedience.<p><b>They spared the best sheep and cattle</b><br>This phrase highlights Saul's disobedience to God's command to destroy everything. The sparing of the best livestock suggests a prioritization of material wealth and human reasoning over divine instruction. This act of disobedience is reminiscent of the Israelites' frequent struggles with idolatry and materialism.<p><b>To sacrifice to the LORD your God</b><br>Saul attempts to justify his disobedience by claiming religious motives. This reflects a misunderstanding of true worship, which requires obedience rather than mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The phrase "your God" may indicate a distancing of Saul's personal relationship with God, contrasting with Samuel's faithful devotion.<p><b>But the rest we devoted to destruction</b><br>This partial obedience is a recurring theme in Israel's history, where incomplete adherence to God's commands leads to negative consequences. The term "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," meaning something set apart for God, often through complete destruction. Saul's failure to fully execute this command foreshadows his rejection as king and the eventual rise of David, a man after God's own heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This bleating and lowing certainly does come from the captured flocks and herds of Amalek, but this reservation, which you condemn, was insisted upon by the people; and their object, for which you blame me for acquiescing in, was to do special honour to God in a great sacrifice." There seems something strangely cowardly in this trying to transfer from himself to the people the blame of disobedience to the Divine commands. It is unlike Saul's old character; but covetousness and vanity invariably lead to moral cowardice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have brought them</span>. No doubt this was verbally true, and very probably the excuse of holding a great sacrifice to Jehovah had been put prominently forward. But reasons are never wanting when men have made up their minds, and the people who so readily obeyed Saul before (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24, 34, 40</a>) would have obeyed him now, had he really wished it. For a king so wilful and imperious as Saul thus to seek for excuses, and try to throw the blame on others, marks, as has been well observed, a thorough break down of his moral character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
