This fear is not terror but a recognition of God's power and a commitment to live according to His will.<p><b>and serve Him</b><br>Serving God involves worship, obedience, and dedication to His commandments. In the context of ancient Israel, service to God was expressed through sacrifices, adherence to the Law, and participation in religious festivals. <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a> emphasizes the choice to serve the LORD, underscoring the voluntary nature of this commitment.<p><b>and obey His voice</b><br>Obedience to God's voice implies listening to and following His commandments as revealed through the prophets and the Law. <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, illustrating the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This obedience is a sign of faith and trust in God's promises.<p><b>and if you do not rebel against the command of the LORD</b><br>Rebellion against God's command is equated with sin and idolatry, as seen in the history of Israel's repeated turning away from God. The consequences of rebellion are severe, often leading to judgment and exile, as depicted in the narratives of the prophets. This phrase calls for steadfastness and loyalty to God's covenant.<p><b>and if both you and the king who rules over you</b><br>The inclusion of the king highlights the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king was expected to lead the nation in covenant faithfulness. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> provides guidelines for kingship, emphasizing the king's role in upholding God's law. The king's faithfulness was crucial for the nation's well-being.<p><b>follow the LORD your God</b><br>Following the LORD involves a holistic commitment to His ways, encompassing moral, spiritual, and communal aspects of life. This phrase echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for love and devotion to God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It signifies a life oriented towards God's purposes.<p><b>then all will be well</b><br>This promise of well-being is contingent upon the people's and the king's faithfulness to God. It reflects the covenant blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience leads to prosperity, peace, and divine favor. This assurance of well-being is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the peace and restoration brought by Jesus Christ, the true King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

A similar unfinished sentence will be found in St. <a href="/luke/19-42.htm" title="Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong to your peace! but now they are hid from your eyes.">Luke 19:42</a>, where the apodosis is left to be supplied.<p>Samuel, with mournful earnestness, would drive home to the hearts of the people and their new king the great truth that the past, full of sin and sorrow, was forgiven--that even their present act, which seemed to border on ingratitude to that Mighty One who deigned to concern Himself with the interests of this fickle people, would bring no evil consequences in its track, if only the people and their king would in the future obey the glorious voice of the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye will fear,</span> etc. This verse, like <a href="/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>, is left unfinished, and we must supply <span class="accented">well</span>, as in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. For the verse cannot be translated as in the A.V., but is as follows: "If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment (Hebrew, the mouth) of Jehovah, and if both ye and the king that reigneth over you will follow Jehovah your God, <span class="accented">it shall be well."</span> Samuel piles up one upon another the conditions of their happiness, and then from the depth of his emotion breaks off, leaving the blessed consequences of their obedience unsaid. "To follow Jehovah" implies willing and active service as his attendants, going with him where he will, and being ever ready to obey his voice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/12-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you fear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and serve</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
