The elders were the leaders and representatives of the tribes, often responsible for making important decisions. Their approach to Samuel shows respect but also a pressing need for change. This reflects a pivotal moment in Israel's history, where the leadership structure was about to shift from judges to a monarchy.<p><b>&#8220;you are old,</b><br>Samuel's age is significant here as it implies a transition period. In ancient cultures, age was associated with wisdom and experience, but it also meant that the time for new leadership was approaching. Samuel had been a faithful judge and prophet, but his advancing age raised concerns about the continuity of leadership and governance.<p><b>and your sons do not walk in your ways.</b><br>This highlights the failure of Samuel's sons, Joel and Abijah, who were appointed as judges but were corrupt, taking bribes and perverting justice (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). This mirrors the earlier situation with Eli and his sons, emphasizing a recurring issue of leadership failure in Israel. The moral decline of Samuel's sons contrasts with Samuel's own integrity and faithfulness, underscoring the need for a new form of leadership.<p><b>Now appoint a king</b><br>The request for a king marks a significant shift in Israel's governance. Up to this point, Israel was led by judges, who were seen as divinely appointed leaders. The desire for a king reflects a move towards a centralized and hereditary monarchy, similar to surrounding nations. This request was not just about governance but also about identity and security, as the Israelites sought stability and protection.<p><b>to judge us</b><br>The role of a king as a judge was to provide leadership, make legal decisions, and ensure justice. This request indicates a desire for a leader who would unify the nation and provide consistent governance. The term "judge" here connects to the role of the judges in Israel, but with the added authority and permanence of a king.<p><b>like all the other nations.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reveals the Israelites' desire to conform to the political structures of neighboring nations. It reflects a tension between their unique identity as God's chosen people and the pressures to assimilate into the surrounding culture. This request was seen as a rejection of God's kingship over Israel, as noted in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>. The desire to be "like all the other nations" foreshadows the challenges Israel would face in maintaining their distinct covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel.

Ignoring that balance leads to later regret (<a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>; 12:19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;to judge us&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Judge&#8221; here means more than legal arbitration; it covers governing, protecting, and leading in battle, roles Samuel already performed (<a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; By equating kingship with judging, they view leadership in purely administrative and military terms, undervaluing the spiritual dimension that God built into the office of the judge (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The substitution of a human king for divine rule foreshadows how Israel will later rely on chariots and alliances rather than covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;like all the other nations.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This phrase exposes the true motive: conformity to surrounding cultures. God had warned, &#8220;You must not follow their practices&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3</a>) and had set Israel apart as His treasured possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Wanting to mirror pagan nations amounts to rejecting God&#8217;s kingship: &#8220;But you have rejected your God, who saves you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The same impulse resurfaces when Israel seeks foreign policy solutions without consulting the Lord (<a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>) and when believers today face pressure to fit the world&#8217;s mold (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a> records a real conversation that exposes Israel&#8217;s shifting trust.

The verse reminds us that genuine problems never justify abandoning divine design; instead, they call for renewed dependence on the Lord, who alone appoints leaders in His perfect wisdom and timing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And said unto him.</span>--They ground their request--which, however, they framed almost in the very terms used in the prophecy of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>)--upon two circumstances: first, the age of Samuel, and his consequent inability to act as their leader in those perpetual wars and forays with the surrounding hostile nations; secondly, the degeneracy of his sons, who, placed by their father in positions of great trust, naturally looked to succeed him in his high dignity. They felt that the cares and duties of government were too weighty for Samuel, now growing old; and the men who through their kinship to him would naturally succeed him were utterly unfit for his office. The prospect before them was, they felt, a gloomy one. The Philistine power, too, was becoming daily greater in the south.<p>But what confidence must this assembly of elders have reposed in their aged judge to have used such a plea--his own growing infirmity and the unworthiness of his own sons, whom he had himself appointed to high offices! The elders of the people knew Samuel, the man of God, would do what was right and just--would give them the wisest counsel, utterly regardless of any private interest or feeling. The result justified their perfect confidence.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
