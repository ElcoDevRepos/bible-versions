The presence of the Ark brought calamity, demonstrating God's power and holiness. The Philistines, despite their initial victory, faced divine retribution. This reflects the biblical theme that God defends His honor and the sanctity of His presence, as seen in other instances where God's holiness is violated (e.g., Uzzah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>).<p><b>were afflicted with tumors</b><br>The affliction of tumors is a direct consequence of the Philistines' disrespect for the Ark. The Hebrew term used here can also be translated as "boils" or "swellings," suggesting a painful and humiliating condition. This punishment parallels the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>), where God used physical afflictions to demonstrate His power and compel obedience. The tumors may symbolize the spiritual corruption and moral decay of the Philistines, contrasting with the purity required by God.<p><b>and the outcry of the city</b><br>The outcry signifies the collective distress and desperation of the Philistine people. In ancient Near Eastern culture, communal lamentation was a common response to disaster. This outcry echoes the cries of the Israelites in times of oppression (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>), highlighting a universal human response to suffering. It underscores the severity of God's judgment and the inability of the Philistines to escape His wrath.<p><b>went up to heaven</b><br>This phrase suggests that the cries of the Philistines reached God, indicating His awareness of human suffering, even among those who do not worship Him. It reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over all nations and attentive to the affairs of the world (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>). The imagery of cries reaching heaven is also seen in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>), where God responds to the outcry against sin.

The phrase stresses that death had become a very real possibility for everyone in Ekron; only God&#8217;s mercy allowed any survivors at all.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows that when God&#8217;s holiness is violated, life itself is at stake&#8212;think of the firstborn in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>) or the sons of Aaron (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226;

Nothing escapes His notice (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The Philistines, though polytheistic, now appeal&#8212;directly or indirectly&#8212;to Israel&#8217;s God, acknowledging His supremacy (<a href="/1_samuel/5-7.htm">1 Samuel 5:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their desperation moves them to summon the Philistine rulers, leading to the decision to return the Ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11</a>; 6:1&#8211;2). Suffering, therefore, becomes the catalyst for submitting to God&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a> paints a sobering picture of God&#8217;s holiness colliding with human irreverence. Survivors of divine judgment feel His hand in their own bodies, and the city&#8217;s collective wail rises heavenward, proving that the God of Israel rules every nation. The verse drives home three truths: God&#8217;s judgments are lethal apart from mercy, His signs of displeasure are unmistakable, and every cry&#8212;friend or foe&#8212;reaches His throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cry of the city went up to heaven.</span> Not the word used in ver. 10, where it is an outcry of indignation, but a cry for help, a cry of sorrow and distress. Though in ver. 10 Ekronites is in the plural, yet in all that follows the singular is used. "They have brought about the ark to me, to slay me and my people... That it slay me not and my people." It is the prince of Ekron who, as the representative of the people, expostulates with his fellow rulers for the wrong they are doing him. But finally all join in his lamentation, and the whole city, smitten by God's band sends up its prayer to heaven for mercy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
