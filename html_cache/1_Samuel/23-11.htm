The citizens of Keilah, though recently aided by David, may feel pressured by King Saul's authority and military power. This reflects the precarious nature of alliances and loyalty in ancient Israel, where survival often depended on aligning with the most powerful force. The question highlights the theme of betrayal and the fickle nature of human loyalty, which is a recurring issue in David's life.<p><b>Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard?</b><br>David seeks confirmation from God about the intelligence he has received regarding Saul's movements. This reflects the constant threat Saul poses to David, who is anointed but not yet reigning as king. The phrase underscores the tension between David and Saul, a central narrative in 1 Samuel. It also illustrates David's reliance on divine guidance rather than solely on human intelligence or military strategy.<p><b>O LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.&#8221;</b><br>David's plea to God demonstrates his dependence on divine wisdom and guidance. The invocation of "O LORD, God of Israel" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people. David's approach to God as "Your servant" shows humility and recognition of his role under God's authority. This phrase is a model of prayerful inquiry, seeking God's will in times of uncertainty.<p><b>&#8220;He will,&#8221; said the LORD.</b><br>God's response is direct and clear, affirming the reliability of divine revelation. This assurance from God provides David with the necessary information to make strategic decisions. The certainty of God's word contrasts with the uncertainty of human intentions and plans. This interaction highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and foreknowledge, as well as His active involvement in the lives of His chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks to kill him.

David&#8217;s inquiry therefore probes whether the townspeople&#8217;s allegiance will withstand pressure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard?</b><p>- David checks the reliability of the report that Saul is on the march. Rather than acting on rumor, he seeks confirmation from the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12-13</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;Your servant&#8221; underscores his humble dependence; he views his own intelligence network as secondary to divine insight (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p>- This step models prudence: verify information before reacting (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.</b><p>- David appeals to the covenant name of God and His special relationship with Israel (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>- His request recognizes that ultimate knowledge and guidance come from the LORD, not merely from human calculations (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-5</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;please tell&#8221; highlights confident yet reverent access to God, made possible through ordained means&#8212;in this context, the ephod carried by Abiathar the priest (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He will,&#8221; said the LORD.</b><p>- God&#8217;s concise answer affirms both His omniscience and His readiness to guide those who ask (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p>- The certainty of the reply empowers David to act wisely; he and his men leave Keilah, sparing the town and eluding Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13-14</a>).<p>- This incident illustrates that divine foreknowledge is not fatalistic; once informed, David responsibly adjusts his course, aligning human action with God&#8217;s revealed insight (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-24, 31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-11.htm">1 Samuel 23:11</a> reveals David&#8217;s heart of dependence, the precariousness of human loyalty, and the faithfulness of God to give precise guidance. By asking detailed, practical questions and receiving a clear answer, David shows that seeking the LORD&#8217;s counsel is essential when facing danger and uncertainty. The verse reassures believers that God knows every contingency and will direct those who earnestly inquire of Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?</span>--There is a curious inversion of David's questions here. In their logical sequence, of course the second, respecting Saul's coming down, should have been put first, for the men of Keilah could not have delivered him into Saul's hands if Saul had not come down. Dean Payne Smith suggests that in David's earnest prayer "his two questions are put inversely to the logical order, but in accordance with the relative importance in his mind." The Dean thinks "that when the ephod was brought forward, the questions were of course put, and replied to in their logical sequence.<p>"And the Lord said, He will come down."<p>" And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up."<p>Thus the answer of the Urim and Thummin was given to the questions in their logical order. The Talmud has an interesting comment here. In consulting the Urim and Thummim, the enquirer is not to ask about <span class= "ital">two things at a time, </span>for if he does, he will be answered about <span class= "ital">one only, </span>and only about the one he first uttered, as it is said (<a href="/context/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.">1Samuel 23:11-12</a>). David asked first "Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hands?" and then he asked also "Will Saul come down?" The answer was to the <span class= "ital">second </span>query. "And the Lord said He will come down." But it has just been asserted that the enquirer will be answered only about the one thing he first uttered. To this it is replied, David framed his enquiry not <span class= "ital">in good order, </span>but the reply of the Urim and Thummim was as though the enquiry had been <span class= "ital">in proper order. </span>Hence when David became aware that his question had not been put properly, he repeated it again in better order, as it has been said, "Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>fol. 73, Colossians 1.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Will the citizens</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1167.htm">Strong's 1167: </a> </span><span class="str2">A master, a husband, owner</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Keilah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7084.htm">Strong's 7084: </a> </span><span class="str2">Keilah -- a city in Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">surrender me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1467;&#1443;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;yas&#183;gi&#183;ru&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124;
