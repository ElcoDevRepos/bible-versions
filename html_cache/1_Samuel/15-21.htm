In the context of ancient warfare, it was common for victors to take spoils from the defeated, including livestock. However, God had commanded through Samuel that everything should be destroyed (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). This disobedience reflects a failure to fully adhere to God's instructions, emphasizing the importance of complete obedience to divine commands. The taking of plunder contrasts with the concept of herem, or things devoted to destruction, which were to be completely annihilated as an offering to God.<p><b>the best of the things devoted to destruction</b><br>The phrase "devoted to destruction" refers to items that were to be completely destroyed as an act of devotion to God, signifying the total eradication of sin and evil. The choice to keep "the best" indicates a selective obedience, where Saul and his troops prioritized their judgment over God's command. This mirrors the temptation to compromise on God's standards for personal gain or reasoning. The act of keeping the best for themselves shows a misunderstanding of what true sacrifice and devotion to God entail.<p><b>in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God</b><br>This justification for keeping the plunder reveals a misguided attempt to rationalize disobedience. The intention to sacrifice suggests a desire to worship, but it is marred by the initial act of disobedience. This reflects a broader biblical theme that God desires obedience over sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The phrase "your God" may indicate a distancing in Saul's relationship with God, as if acknowledging Samuel's God rather than his own, highlighting Saul's spiritual decline.<p><b>at Gilgal</b><br>Gilgal holds significant historical and religious importance in Israel's history. It was the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It became a place of renewal and covenant, where Saul was confirmed as king (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>). The mention of Gilgal here underscores the irony of Saul's disobedience in a place associated with commitment to God. It serves as a reminder of the need for faithfulness to God's commands, especially in places of spiritual significance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This spreads the blame yet does not remove Saul&#8217;s responsibility as commander (<a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19, 24</a>).<p>- By acting collectively, the army exposes how quickly people will follow a leader into disobedience when clear orders from the LORD are ignored (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sheep and cattle</b><p>- These animals were prime economic assets in Israel&#8217;s agrarian society, representing wealth and security (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>).<p>- The attraction of tangible gain made God&#8217;s command feel costly, revealing hearts that valued prosperity over obedience (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the plunder</b><p>- &#8220;Plunder&#8221; underscores that the livestock belonged to God the moment He declared Amalek under the ban (herem). Keeping it was stealing from the LORD (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly shows that unauthorized plunder brings judgment, whether in Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17&#8211;18</a>) or Nineveh (<a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the best of the things devoted to destruction</b><p>- &#8220;Best&#8221; signals deliberate selection. They did not merely spare random animals; they picked the choicest, the exact opposite of wholehearted obedience (<a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p>- Everything under the ban was already &#8220;devoted&#8221; to God for destruction (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>). Retaining it broke covenant terms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in order to sacrifice them</b><p>- The soldiers&#8217; excuse sounds spiritual, yet God had not authorized it. Obedience is better than sacrifice (the lesson Samuel states in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>- Similar attempts to mask rebellion with ritual appear in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11&#8211;15</a> and <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6&#8211;8</a>. God values a yielded heart, not token offerings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the LORD your God</b><p>- Saul&#8217;s wording distances himself: &#8220;your God,&#8221; not &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;my.&#8221; This subtle shift betrays how disobedience strains intimacy with the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>).<p>- When Moses confronted Pharaoh, the pagan king also spoke of &#8220;your God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>); distancing language often signals a heart that is not fully surrendered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Gilgal</b><p>- Gilgal had been a place of covenant renewal and earlier victories (<a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>- Choosing that location may have been an attempt to cloak disobedience with the memory of past faithfulness, yet past victories cannot legitimize present sin (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a> exposes how partial obedience is full disobedience. The troops, led by Saul, knowingly spared the best livestock that God had ordered destroyed, justifying their sin with religious language and plans for sacrifice. Their actions reveal that when we treasure gain, reputation, or ritual above God&#8217;s clear Word, we drift into rebellion. True worship begins with unqualified obedience; anything less, no matter how pious it sounds, falls short of honoring the LORD.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The troops</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1447;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
