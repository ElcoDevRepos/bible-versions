The "day" refers to the aftermath of David's victory over Goliath, which is a pivotal event in Israel's history. This victory not only established David as a national hero but also as a key figure in God's unfolding plan for Israel. The phrase indicates a new chapter in David's life, where he transitions from a shepherd boy to a prominent figure in the royal court.<p><b>Saul kept David with him</b><br>King Saul's decision to keep David close reflects both political and personal motivations. Politically, David's success against Goliath made him a valuable asset to Saul's military endeavors. Personally, Saul may have been drawn to David's charisma and the favor he had with the people. However, this decision also sets the stage for the complex and often tumultuous relationship between Saul and David. Saul's initial favor towards David eventually turns to jealousy and fear, as Saul perceives David as a threat to his throne.<p><b>and did not let him return to his father&#8217;s house</b><br>David's separation from his father's house signifies a break from his previous life and responsibilities as a shepherd. This move is symbolic of David's new role and identity within Israel. It also fulfills a pattern seen in Scripture where God calls individuals away from their familial ties to fulfill a greater purpose, as seen with Abraham and Moses. This separation is both a literal and figurative step towards David's future as king. Additionally, it foreshadows the eventual estrangement and conflict between Saul and David, as Saul's initial favor turns to suspicion and hostility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Now the king sees David&#8217;s military skill and wants constant access to it (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s new status fulfills Samuel&#8217;s warning that Israel&#8217;s king would conscript the best young men (<a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrangement appears beneficial at first:<p>&#8211; David gains training and visibility.<p>&#8211; Saul gains a valiant warrior whose victories encourage the nation (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this proximity also becomes the stage for Saul&#8217;s growing jealousy (<a href="/1_samuel/18-12.htm">1 Samuel 18:12</a>). God is moving David toward the throne even while Saul tries to control him&#8212;reminding us that &#8220;the LORD God of Hosts was with him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not let him return to his father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226; Prior to Goliath, David &#8220;went back and forth from Saul to tend his father&#8217;s sheep&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm">1 Samuel 17:15</a>). That season ends here.<p>&#8226; The break from Jesse&#8217;s household underscores David&#8217;s new calling; shepherding Israel will replace shepherding sheep (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>).<p>&#8226; This costly separation foreshadows Jesus&#8217; call to leave family ties for God&#8217;s mission (<a href="/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesse releases his son, trusting God&#8217;s plan&#8212;much like Hannah released Samuel earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse illustrates that when God repositions us, He also provides the grace to embrace new responsibilities and relationships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a> records a pivotal relocation: from the day of Goliath&#8217;s defeat, Saul took permanent custody of David, preventing any further return to Jesse&#8217;s home. The Lord uses this royal appointment to train, test, and ultimately elevate David, while also exposing Saul&#8217;s heart. What appears to be Saul&#8217;s decision is, in fact, God&#8217;s sovereign step in advancing His promise to raise up a king after His own heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul took him that day.</span> Bent solely on war, Saul gladly took so promising, a young soldier as David to be one of his bodyguard (<a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>), and henceforward he was constantly with him. Thus in two ways, first as a musician, and now as a soldier, David was forced into those intimate relations with Saul, which ended so tragically. For a while, however, those happier results ensued summed up in <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan and David made a covenant.</span> We are not to suppose that this happened immediately. David continued on friendly terms with Saul for a considerable period, during which he went on many expeditions, and grew in military renown (see ver. 5). And thus the love which began with admiration of David's prowess grew deeper and more confirmed by constant intercourse, till this solemn bond of mutual friendship was entered into by the two youthful heroes, by which they bound themselves under all circumstances to be true and faithful to one another. How nobly Jonathan kept the bond the history proceeds immediately to tell us; nor was David subsequently unmindful of it (<a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:l, 7). <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan stripped himself of the robe,</span> etc. In confirmation of the bond Jonathan gave David first his <span class="accented">robe</span>, the <span class="accented">meil</span>, which, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:19, was the ordinary dress of the wealthier classes; and next <span class="cmt_word">his garments,</span> his military dress (see on 1 Samuel 17:38, 39), worn over the <span class="accented">meil</span>, and which here seems to include his accoutrements, - the bow, sword, and girdle, - though elsewhere distinguished from them (<a href="/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>). In thus clothing David in his own princely equipments Jonathan was showing his friend the greatest personal honour (<a href="/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>), and such a gift is still highly esteemed in the East. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And from that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
