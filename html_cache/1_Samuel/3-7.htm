This highlights the distinction between religious service and personal knowledge of God. In the Hebrew context, "knowing" the LORD implies an intimate, covenantal relationship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4:1</a> where Adam "knew" Eve. Samuel's lack of knowledge signifies that he had not yet encountered God in a direct, transformative way. This moment foreshadows the personal call and revelation that would soon come to Samuel, marking the beginning of his prophetic ministry.<p><b>because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him</b><br>The "word of the LORD" refers to divine communication, often through visions or direct speech, which was a common way God communicated with His prophets, as seen with Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> and Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. At this point, Samuel had not received such a revelation, indicating that prophetic insight and understanding are gifts from God, not based on human effort or position. This phrase underscores the importance of divine initiative in establishing a relationship with His chosen servants. It also sets the stage for the subsequent verses where God calls Samuel, marking a pivotal moment in Israel's history as God begins to speak through him, transitioning from the period of the judges to the era of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under the priest Eli.

Samuel&#8217;s calling stands out precisely because the nation had grown dull to God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did not yet know the LORD</b><p>- &#8220;Know&#8221; points to personal relationship, not mere information. Compare the tragic line, &#8220;another generation rose up who knew neither the LORD nor the works He had done&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>).<p>- Serving in the tabernacle did not automatically equal intimacy. Religious activity can precede real encounter (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- The New Testament echoes this: &#8220;Now this is eternal life, that they may know You&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). Samuel is on the cusp of that kind of knowledge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the word of the LORD</b><p>- God makes Himself known chiefly through His spoken, revealed word. From Abram (&#8220;the word of the LORD came to Abram,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) to the prophets (&#8220;the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>), the pattern is constant.<p>- Scripture itself testifies, &#8220;The unfolding of Your words gives light&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a>). Until that unfolding occurs, real knowledge of God remains partial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had not yet been revealed to him</b><p>- Revelation is God&#8217;s initiative. &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>- In Samuel&#8217;s case the first revelation will be startling (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>) and prophetic, setting the course of his life.<p>- Jesus underscores the principle: &#8220;this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>). What Samuel lacks on his own, heaven is about to supply.<p>- When God does reveal Himself, He expects obedience; Samuel&#8217;s quick response (&#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening,&#8221; <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) shows the heart God seeks (<a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s upbringing and ministry duties could not substitute for a personal encounter with God. <a href="/1_samuel/3-7.htm">1 Samuel 3:7</a> explains the gap: he served faithfully, yet intimacy awaited divine revelation.
