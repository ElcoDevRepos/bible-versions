It shows respect and adherence to social hierarchies. In the context of 1 Samuel, David is speaking to Jonathan, Saul's son, and is seeking permission to leave the king's presence. This request is part of a larger plan to discern King Saul's intentions towards David.<p><b>because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city,</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship and community life, often involving entire families or clans. This particular sacrifice is likely a peace offering, which was a communal meal shared among family members. The mention of a clan gathering indicates the importance of family and tribal connections in Israelite society. The city referred to is Bethlehem, David's hometown, which is significant as the birthplace of Jesus Christ, connecting David's lineage to the Messianic prophecy.<p><b>and my brother has told me to be there.</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial obligations and expectations within the clan structure. David's mention of his brother underscores the importance of family ties and responsibilities. In the broader biblical narrative, David's relationship with his brothers is complex, as seen in earlier chapters where he is initially overlooked by his family. This request also serves as a plausible reason for David's absence from Saul's court, aligning with the cultural norms of the time.<p><b>So now, if I have found favor in your eyes,</b><br>Finding favor in someone's eyes is a recurring biblical theme, often indicating a request for grace or approval. This phrase is reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought favor, such as Esther before King Xerxes. It reflects humility and the seeking of goodwill, which is a key aspect of David's relationship with Jonathan. Their covenantal friendship is a significant element in the narrative, illustrating loyalty and divine providence.<p><b>please let me go and see my brothers.&#8217;</b><br>David's request to see his brothers emphasizes the importance of family unity and support. In the biblical context, brothers often symbolize close kinship and shared heritage. This phrase also subtly underscores David's precarious position at Saul's court, as he seeks refuge and reassurance among his own kin. The theme of brotherhood is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be brothers and sisters in Christ.<p><b>That is why he has not come to the king&#8217;s table.&#8221;</b><br>The king's table symbolizes royal favor and acceptance, as well as the political and social dynamics of Saul's court. David's absence from the table is significant, as it foreshadows the growing tension and eventual conflict between Saul and David. In biblical typology, the king's table can be seen as a precursor to the Lord's Table in the New Testament, where believers are invited to partake in communion with Christ. David's absence highlights his alienation and the unfolding of God's plan for his future kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul's wrath.

Saul&#8217;s furious reaction exposes murderous intent, validating David&#8217;s concerns.<p>&#8226; The empty seat at Saul&#8217;s table foreshadows David&#8217;s eventual departure from court life until God installs him as king (<a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty works through ordinary decisions&#8212;like attending a family feast&#8212;to protect His servant (<a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for today</b><p>&#8226; Respect for authority and family can coexist with prudent avoidance of danger.<p>&#8226; Strategic action is compatible with unwavering faith; believers wisely navigate hostile environments (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Integrity involves telling the truth while discerning how much to reveal (<a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a> records David&#8217;s courteous, worship-centered request&#8212;relayed by Jonathan&#8212;to miss Saul&#8217;s feast for a clan sacrifice. Each phrase underscores reverence for God, respect for authority, and commitment to family. The statement provides Jonathan the test that unmask&#173;s Saul&#8217;s hostility, safeguards David&#8217;s life, and advances God&#8217;s unfolding plan to seat David on Israel&#8217;s throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me.</span>--Jonathan answers the king's question in the way previously agreed upon between him and David. He quotes the excuse in David's own words.<p>The LXX., instead of "my brother," has "my brothers." It thus alters the original, not understanding the singular "brother," Jesse, their father, being still alive. The brothers collectively might, the LXX. seemed to think, have bidden David to the family sacrificial feast. Dean Payne Smith suggests that as the ceremony was not a private family gathering, but one shared in by the district, the "brother" (probably the eldest), likely enough, was the convener of the absent member of the house of Jesse.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1441;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
