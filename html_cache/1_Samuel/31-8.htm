The timing is significant as it shows the Philistines' swift action to claim victory and plunder the battlefield. In ancient warfare, the day after a battle was often dedicated to collecting spoils and dealing with the dead.<p><b>when the Philistines came to strip the dead</b><br>Stripping the dead was a common practice in ancient warfare, where victors would take armor, weapons, and valuables from the fallen. This act not only provided material gain but also served as a symbolic gesture of dominance over the defeated. The Philistines, traditional enemies of Israel, were known for their military prowess and often engaged in such practices.<p><b>they found Saul and his three sons</b><br>The discovery of Saul and his sons' bodies highlights the tragic end of Israel's first king and his heirs. Saul's death marked the end of his troubled reign, which was characterized by disobedience to God and conflict with David.

The defeat at Mount Gilboa fulfilled Samuel's prophecy of Saul's downfall (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>).

So desperate had been the valour with which the King and his gallant sons had defended their last positions on the hill, that night had fallen ere the din of battle ceased. Nor were the enemy aware of the completeness of their success until the morning dawn revealed to the soldiers as they went over the scene, the great ones who were numbered among the slain. In the mean time the Amalekite had found and carried off the crown and royal bracelet. Only the bodies of Saul and the princes, and the armourbearer, are spoken of here. The crown royal, which would have formed so splendid a trophy, was already taken.<p>"O Saul,<p>How ghastly didst thou look, on thine own sword<p>Expiring: in Gilboa, from that hour<p>Ne'er visited with rain from heaven, nor dew."<p>DANTE: <span class= "ital">Pura. </span>12<p>The curse of barrenness alluded to by the great Italian poet was called down on the hill where the first anointed of the Lord fell, and where the body was stripped and dismembered by the triumphant foe (<a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm" title="You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.">2Samuel 1:21</a>). Quickly the tidings were told, we learn, in the capital of Gath, and proclaimed through the streets of Askelon.<p>The historian with extreme brevity records the savage treatment of the royal remains, which, after all, was but a reprisal.
