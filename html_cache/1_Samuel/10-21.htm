This highlights God's sovereignty in choosing leaders, often selecting the least expected. The tribe of Benjamin had a tumultuous history, including near extinction due to civil war (Judges 20-21), yet God chose to bring forth a king from this tribe, demonstrating His redemptive purposes.<p><b>and the clan of Matri was selected</b><br>The clan of Matri is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating its obscurity. This selection process, likely involving casting lots (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>), underscores the divine guidance in leadership choices. The use of lots was a common practice in ancient Israel to discern God's will, reflecting a reliance on divine providence rather than human decision-making.<p><b>Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected</b><br>Saul's selection as king was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy. Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin, was chosen despite his initial reluctance and humility (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>). His selection fulfilled the people's demand for a king to lead them like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), yet it also set the stage for future challenges, as God had warned about the implications of having a human king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>).<p><b>But when they looked for him, they could not find him</b><br>Saul's absence at the moment of his selection reflects his initial hesitance and humility, as he was hiding among the baggage (<a href="/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>). This reluctance can be seen as a sign of humility, but it also foreshadows his later struggles with insecurity and leadership. Saul's hiding contrasts with the boldness expected of a king, highlighting the tension between human frailty and divine calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and last judge of Israel, who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to be the first king of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its warriors and strategic location.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clan_of_matri.htm">Clan of Matri</a></b><br>A specific family group within the tribe of Benjamin, from which Saul was chosen.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The place where the selection of Saul as king took place, a significant site for gatherings and covenant renewals in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God chooses leaders according to His divine will, often beyond human expectations or qualifications.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Saul's initial humility is a reminder that true leadership begins with a humble heart, recognizing one's dependence on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Samuel's role in anointing Saul underscores the importance of spiritual guidance and prophetic insight in leadership decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing_and_revelation.htm">Divine Timing and Revelation</a></b><br>God's plans unfold in His perfect timing, as seen in the selection process of Saul, teaching us patience and trust in God's timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hidden_potential.htm">Hidden Potential</a></b><br>Saul's initial hiding reflects how God often calls those who may not see their own potential, encouraging us to trust in God's vision for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_10_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 10:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_10_21_God_s_choice_in_leaders.htm">How does 1 Samuel 10:21 demonstrate God's sovereignty in choosing leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_humility_from_Saul_s_response.htm">What can we learn about humility from Saul's reaction in 1 Samuel 10:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Sam_10_21_to_God_s_choice_of_David.htm">How does 1 Samuel 10:21 connect with God's selection of David later?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Responding_to_God_s_unexpected_call.htm">How should we respond when God calls us to unexpected roles or tasks?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Saul_s_hiding_insights_on_humans_God.htm">What does Saul's hiding reveal about human nature and God's plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_choose_Saul_despite_failures.htm">Why was Saul chosen by God despite his later failures as king in 1 Samuel 10:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_10_21_God_s_role_in_leader_choice.htm">How does 1 Samuel 10:21 reflect God's sovereignty in selecting leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_Saul_hiding_in_baggage.htm">What does Saul hiding among the baggage in 1 Samuel 10:21 symbolize?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_spirit_empower_saul.htm">In 1 Samuel 11:6, how can an invisible Spirit &#8220;rush upon&#8221; Saul and make him so effective in leadership, given a skeptical view of supernatural involvement?

Each stage underscores divine control, transparency, and purpose. Saul&#8217;s initial hiding highlights the tension between God&#8217;s calling and human frailty, setting the stage for his reign and reminding us that while God&#8217;s choice is perfect, the human vessel remains dependent on ongoing obedience and trust in the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The family of Matri was taken.</span>--In none of the Benjamite genealogies connected with the royal house of Saul does this name occur. We cannot account for the omission. Ewald conjectures that the name Matri is a corruption from "Bikri" (see <a href="/1_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="And the sons of Becher; Zemira, and Joash, and Eliezer, and Elioenai, and Omri, and Jerimoth, and Abiah, and Anathoth, and Alameth.

Matri is not mentioned anywhere else; and numerous as are the omissions in the genealogies, we can scarcely suppose that the name of the head of one of the main subdivisions of a tribe could be passed over. The conjecture, therefore, is probable that Matri is a corruption of Bikri, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a descendant of Becher, for whom see <a href="/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>. After the lot had fallen upon this family they would next cast lots upon its smaller subdivisions, as in <a href="/joshua/7-17.htm">Joshua 7:17, 18</a>, until at last they came to households, when first Kish, and finally Saul was taken. The latter, foreseeing that this would happen, had concealed himself. For though a noble change had taken place in him (ver. 9), yet no really worthy man was ever promoted to high office without having to overcome his own unwillingness, and no one probably ever worthily discharged solemn duties without having felt oppressed and humbled with the consciousness of his own unfitness to undertake them. As a matter of fact, Saul was now called to a most weighty responsibility, and he failed and was rejected, though not without proving that he was a man of extraordinary genius and power. And it never can be said of him that presumption was the cause of his fall, or that he hastily undertook serious duties in the spirit of light-hearted levity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he had the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1444;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#183;&#7687;e&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7626.htm">Strong's 7626: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rod, staff, club, scepter, tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Benjamin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bin&#183;y&#257;&#183;min)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1144.htm">Strong's 1144: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benjamin -- 'son of the right hand', youngest son of Jacob, also the name of two other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come forward</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1438;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yaq&#183;r&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
