In ancient Israel, children were seen as a blessing from God, and barrenness was often viewed as a sign of divine disfavor or a test of faith. The Bible frequently records instances where God intervenes in matters of childbirth, such as with Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>) and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22-24</a>). The closing of Hannah's womb serves as a backdrop for God's eventual miraculous intervention, emphasizing His power and timing. It also sets the stage for the birth of Samuel, a significant prophet in Israel's history, who would anoint the first two kings of Israel.<p><b>her rival would provoke her viciously</b><br>Hannah's rival, Peninnah, is described as provoking her, which reflects the cultural and familial tensions that could arise from polygamous marriages. In the ancient Near East, a woman's status was often tied to her ability to bear children, particularly sons. Peninnah's provocations may have stemmed from jealousy or a desire to assert her own status within the household. This dynamic is reminiscent of other biblical stories of rivalry between women, such as Leah and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1-8</a>). The use of the word "viciously" underscores the intensity of the emotional pain and social pressure Hannah faced.<p><b>to taunt her</b><br>The act of taunting highlights the personal and emotional suffering Hannah endured. This taunting was not just a personal attack but also a public humiliation, as childlessness was a visible and socially significant issue. The narrative invites readers to empathize with Hannah's plight and her perseverance in faith despite her circumstances. This theme of enduring faith in the face of adversity is echoed in other biblical figures, such as Job, who remained faithful despite severe trials (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21-22</a>). Hannah's response to her situation, turning to God in prayer, foreshadows the New Testament teaching of casting all anxieties on God (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was deeply loved by her husband Elkanah but was barren.

Polygamy, though recorded in Scripture, always breeds strife (<a href="/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30-31</a>).<p>&#8211; Peninnah&#8217;s provocation is continual: &#8220;year after year&#8221; during the family&#8217;s worship trip to Shiloh (<a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Similar rivalries appear with Hagar and Sarah (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4-6</a>). Each instance shows how human arrangements outside God&#8217;s original design lead to heartache.<p>&#8211; Even in the face of provocation, Hannah does not retaliate; she turns to prayer, foreshadowing Christlike meekness (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>viciously to taunt her</b><p>&#8211; The phrase underscores deliberate cruelty. Peninnah&#8217;s taunts targeted Hannah&#8217;s deepest longing&#8212;children&#8212;magnifying her pain until she &#8220;wept and would not eat&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture warns against such malicious speech (<a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6-10</a>) and calls believers to compassionate tongues (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<p>&#8211; God sees and remembers the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).

The Lord&#8217;s purposeful delay sets the stage for a miraculous birth and a national deliverer, reminding us that His timing and plans, though sometimes painful, are always perfect and redemptive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And her adversary also provoked her sore.</span>--Jealousy, grief, anger, malice, the many bitter fruits of this way of living, so different to God's original appointment, here show themselves. The one sin of polygamy poisons the whole home life of the family, in all other respects apparently a quiet, Godfearing, orderly household.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her adversary also provoked her sore.</span> The pleasure of this domestic festival was spoiled by the discord of the wives. Peninnah, triumphant in her fruitfulness, is yet Hannah's adversary, because, in spite of her barrenness, she has the larger portion of the husband's love; while Hannah is so sorely vexed at the taunts of her rival, that she weeps from sheer vexation. In vain Elkanah tries to give her comfort. The husband really is not "better than ten sons," for the joy of motherhood is quite distinct from that of conjugal affection, and especially to a Hebrew woman, who had special hopes from which she was cut off by barrenness. In ver. 7 there is a strange confusion of subject, owing to the first verb having been read as an active instead of a passive. It should be, "And so it happened year by year: when she (Hannah) went up to the house of Jehovah she (Peninnah) thus provoked her, and she wept and did not eat." It must be remembered that the Hebrews had no written vowels, but only consonants; the vowels were added in Christian times, many centuries after the coming of our Lord, and represent the traditional manner of reading of one great Jewish school. They are to be treated with the greatest respect, because as a rule they give us a sense confirmed by the best authorities; but they are human, and form no part of Holy Scripture. The ancient versions, the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, which are all three older than the Masoretic vowels, translate, "And so she (Peninnah) did year by year;" but this requires a slight change of the consonants. <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had closed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;&#7713;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5462.htm">Strong's 5462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shut up, to surrender</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Hannah's] womb,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7717;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
