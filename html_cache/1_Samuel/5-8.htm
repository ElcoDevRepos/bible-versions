These rulers were responsible for making decisions that affected the entire Philistine territory. The calling together of these rulers indicates the seriousness of the situation. The Philistines had captured the Ark of the Covenant, a significant religious artifact for the Israelites, and were experiencing calamities as a result. This gathering reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of consulting leaders or diviners in times of crisis.<p><b>&#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221;</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Its capture was initially seen as a victory for the Philistines, but the subsequent plagues and afflictions led them to question its presence. The Philistines recognized the power associated with the Ark, even if they did not fully understand it. This question highlights their desperation and fear, as they sought a solution to the divine retribution they were experiencing.<p><b>&#8220;It must be moved to Gath,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, along with Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gaza. The decision to move the Ark to Gath suggests an attempt to distribute the burden or test if the calamities would follow the Ark. Gath's selection might have been due to its strategic importance or the belief that its gods or defenses could withstand the Ark's power. This decision reflects a lack of understanding of the true nature of the God of Israel, treating the Ark as a mere object rather than the dwelling place of the divine.<p><b>So they carried away the ark of the God of Israel.</b><br>The act of moving the Ark demonstrates the Philistines' continued misunderstanding and underestimation of its significance. This movement sets the stage for further divine intervention, as the Ark's presence in Philistine territory continues to bring about God's judgment. The narrative underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and power, which cannot be contained or manipulated by human hands. This event foreshadows the eventual return of the Ark to Israel, symbolizing God's enduring covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and had captured the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_of_the_philistines.htm">Rulers of the Philistines</a></b><br>Leaders who were responsible for making decisions regarding the Ark.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_god_of_israel.htm">Ark of the God of Israel</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>One of the five major cities of the Philistines, to which the Ark was moved.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, whose Ark had been captured by the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The Ark symbolized God's presence, and the Philistines' mishandling of it led to dire consequences.

Here the urgency underscores that the plagues striking Ashdod (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>) are unmistakably divine.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty presses even His enemies into conference, echoing <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> and <a href="/acts/4-26.htm">Acts 4:26</a>, where &#8220;the rulers gather together against the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Their question admits the ark is no ordinary trophy.

Human pride melts when confronted by the living God.<p>&#8226; Notice they do not ask how to repent, only how to manage the ark. The concern is relief, not righteousness&#8212;a pattern repeated in <a href="/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a> where people &#8220;did not repent of their deeds.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;It must be moved to Gath,&#8221; they replied.</b><p>&#8226; The consensus is relocation, not return.

God&#8217;s holiness exposes human attempts to control or contain Him. Moving the ark reshuffles judgment but never removes it; only submission to the LORD ends the plague. <a href="/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a> thus teaches that God&#8217;s presence demands reverence, and any strategy short of repentance merely transfers the consequences of resisting Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them.</span>--The Philistine federation seems to have been a very powerful one, and owing to the disinclination of the Israelites to maritime pursuits and foreign commerce--[the foreign commercial expeditions of King Solomon were apparently quite exceptional]--held in their hands a large proportion of the Mediterranean trade--the Mediterranean being the great highway between Eastern and Western nations; hence, no doubt, the worship of Dagon, the fish-god. It seems to have been something more than mere "Nature worship," the devotion of the Ph?nician settlers on the sea-board of Syria and Canaan to a marine deity. The constitution of Philistia was oligarchical: that is, the government was in the hands of a College of Princes, whose decision no individual could oppose. The princes (<span class= "ital">seranim</span>) are the heads of the several city districts, which formed a confederation, each one of the five chief cities holding a number of places, country cities, or "daughter" cities, as its special district. (See Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange's Commentary.</span>) Dr. Payne Smith (Dean of Canterbury) has an ingenious and scholarly derivation for the titular designation of these lords (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">seranim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in which, rejecting the usual root <span class= "ital">sar, </span>a prince, he connects the word with <span class= "ital">seren,</span> a hinge; "just," he says, "as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from <span class= "ital">cardo, </span>which has the same meaning."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lords of the Philistines.</span> Philistia was governed by a council of five princes, but whether they were elective or hereditary in the several towns is by no means clear. They are called "seranim," from <span class="accented">seren</span>, "a hinge," just as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from the Latin word <span class="accented">cardo</span>, which has the same meaning. There is no ground for connecting the word with <span class="accented">sar</span>, "a prince." When Ewald did so he probably forgot that the two words begin with different letters - seren with <span class="accented">samech</span>, and sar with <span class="accented">shin.</span> Seranim is the word constantly used of the lords of the Philistines (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5, 8</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9</a>), though after being correctly so styled in <a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>, they are popularly called in vers. 3, 4, 9, <span class="accented">sarim</span>, "princes." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.</span> Unwilling to part with so signal a proof of their victory, the lords of the Philistines determine to remove the ark to another locality, but thereby only made the miraculous nature of what was taking place more evident to all. Of Gath but little is known; but Jerome describes it as still a large village in his days, and as situated near the border of Judaea, on the road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they called together</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;as&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
