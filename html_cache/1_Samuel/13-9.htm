The burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God (Leviticus 1). The peace offering, on the other hand, was a communal meal shared between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving (Leviticus 3). Saul's command to bring these offerings highlights his impatience and lack of faith, as he was not authorized to perform priestly duties. This act reflects a deeper issue of disobedience and presumption, as only priests, specifically from the line of Aaron, were permitted to offer sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). Saul's actions foreshadow the eventual loss of his kingdom due to his failure to adhere to God's commands.<p><b>And he offered up the burnt offering.</b><br>Saul's decision to offer the burnt offering himself was a direct violation of the established religious order. This act of disobedience is significant because it demonstrates Saul's lack of trust in God's timing and his willingness to take matters into his own hands. The offering of sacrifices was a sacred duty reserved for the prophet Samuel or the priests, and Saul's usurpation of this role indicates a disregard for God's law. This event is pivotal in the narrative of 1 Samuel, as it leads to Samuel's rebuke and the prophecy of Saul's kingdom being taken from him (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>). Saul's actions can be contrasted with the obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly and offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Saul's failure serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Similar crossroads appear with Moses striking the rock (<a href="/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7&#8211;12</a>) and Uzzah touching the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring me the burnt offering</b><p>&#8211; A burnt offering symbolized total dedication to the LORD (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3&#8211;9</a>); everything was consumed on the altar.<p>&#8211; Saul, not being a priest, steps outside his God-given role (<a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1&#8211;7</a>).

Yet obedience is what brings true fellowship (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>).<p>&#8211; The mention of both offerings accentuates the seriousness of Saul&#8217;s violation&#8212;he is commandeering the entire worship sequence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he offered up the burnt offering</b><p>&#8211; The decisive action shifts from mere words to willful disobedience. &#8220;He offered&#8221;&#8212;not a delegated priest, but Saul himself.<p>&#8211; This mirrors humanity&#8217;s earliest impulse to redefine good and evil for ourselves (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Saul&#8217;s impatience costs him the dynasty; immediately after, Samuel announces, &#8220;The LORD has sought out a man after His own heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), pointing forward to David.<p>&#8211; The contrast between Saul&#8217;s self-reliance and David&#8217;s later refusal to &#8220;lift my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>) underscores God&#8217;s desire for hearts that wait on Him (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a> exposes a pivotal misstep: Saul, pressed by fear, seized priestly authority and performed sacrifices meant to be offered only by those God appointed.

The verse warns every believer that true leadership submits to God&#8217;s order, waits for His timing, and values obedience over expedient results.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Bring hither a burnt offering to me.</span>--It has been supposed by many that the greatness of the sin of Saul consisted in his offering sacrifice with his own hand, but not a hint of this is anywhere given us. It is more than probable that the sacrifice which was offered so prematurely in the absence of the seer of God was performed by the hand of Ahiah the priest, who, no doubt, was in attendance on the king. No unlawful assumption of priestly functions, as in the case of King Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm" title="And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It appertains not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from the LORD God.">2Chronicles 26:18</a>), is anywhere charged on Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A burnt offering,</span> etc. The Hebrew has the definite article, <span class="accented">the burnt offering and the peace offerings</span>, which were there ready for Samuel to offer. <span class="cmt_word">He offered.</span> Not with his own hand, but by the hand of the attendant priest, Ahiah, who was, we know, with him.
