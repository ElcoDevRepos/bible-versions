Their actions were not only a personal failing but a violation of their sacred duties. In the context of the Old Testament, priests were mediators between God and the people, and their conduct was expected to be exemplary. The severity of their sin is underscored by the phrase "in the sight of the LORD," indicating that their actions were not hidden from God and were judged by His holy standards. This phrase echoes the biblical principle that God sees and judges the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The gravity of their sin is further highlighted by the fact that it was committed in a religious setting, where reverence and obedience were paramount.<p><b>for they were treating the LORD&#8217;s offering with contempt</b><br>The offerings referred to here are the sacrifices brought by the Israelites to the tabernacle, which were meant to honor God and atone for sin. Hophni and Phinehas were taking portions of the sacrifices that were not rightfully theirs, as described earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-16</a>. This act of contempt was not merely a breach of ritual but a direct affront to God, who had established these offerings as a means of worship and reconciliation. Their actions showed a blatant disregard for the sacredness of the offerings and, by extension, for God Himself. This contempt is reminiscent of Cain's unacceptable offering in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>, where the heart attitude behind the offering was as important as the offering itself. The sons' behavior foreshadows the later corruption of the priesthood, which would ultimately lead to the need for a perfect High Priest, fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Shiloh, who was responsible for the tabernacle and the spiritual leadership of Israel.
