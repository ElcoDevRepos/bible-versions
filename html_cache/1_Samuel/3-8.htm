In biblical numerology, the number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the Trinity. This calling occurs during a time when "the word of the LORD was rare" (<a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>), indicating a period of spiritual drought in Israel. The LORD's direct communication with Samuel marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, as Samuel would become a pivotal prophet and judge.<p><b>He got up, went to Eli, and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you have called me.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's response demonstrates his obedience and respect for Eli, his mentor and the high priest. This reflects the cultural importance of honoring one's elders and leaders. Samuel's willingness to serve is reminiscent of Isaiah's response to God's call, "Here am I. Send me!" (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). The phrase "Here I am" is a common biblical expression of readiness and availability to God's service, seen in figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p><b>Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy.</b><br>Eli's realization signifies a moment of spiritual insight, despite his earlier failures as a priest and father. This acknowledgment marks a transition in leadership from Eli to Samuel, as Eli recognizes the divine calling on Samuel's life. The term "boy" emphasizes Samuel's youth, underscoring the biblical theme that God often chooses the unlikely or the young to fulfill His purposes, as seen with David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>) and Timothy (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).

The repetition highlights God&#8217;s persistence; He does not give up on getting His servant&#8217;s attention (compare <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Christ keeps on knocking).<p>&#8226; In an era &#8220;when the word of the LORD was rare&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>), the very fact that God keeps calling emphasizes His covenant faithfulness despite national spiritual neglect (contrast <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel&#8217;s obedient response</b><p>&#8220;He got up, went to Eli, and said, &#8216;Here I am, for you have called me.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8</a>b)<p>&#8226; Samuel does not grumble or hesitate; he immediately rises and runs to serve, displaying a servant&#8217;s heart (parallel <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; His words &#8220;Here I am&#8221; echo Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a> and Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>&#8212;ready availability to God&#8217;s purposes even before fully understanding them.<p>&#8226; Though still a boy and untrained in prophetic experience (<a href="/1_samuel/3-7.htm">1 Samuel 3:7</a>), Samuel models humility by assuming the older priest is summoning him, not presuming heavenly revelation (compare <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eli&#8217;s dawning realization</b><p>&#8220;Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8</a>c)<p>&#8226; Eli, despite personal failings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>), still has enough spiritual discernment to recognize God&#8217;s voice after the third occurrence (compare <a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>, where recognition comes by divine insight).<p>&#8226; His realization underscores the role of mature believers guiding the young in recognizing God&#8217;s call (see <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene also warns against spiritual dullness: Eli needed multiple incidents before perceiving what should have been obvious, mirroring how repeated divine nudges awaken a sleepy conscience (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Implications for hearing God&#8217;s voice today</b><p>&#8226;

He is patient yet purposeful.<p>&#8226; Obedience and availability position us to hear. Like Samuel, responding to ordinary authority (parents, church leaders) often precedes receiving extraordinary direction (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Discipleship matters: Eli instructs Samuel in verse 9; believers benefit from wise mentors to help discern God&#8217;s leading (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8</a> shows God&#8217;s gracious persistence, Samuel&#8217;s ready obedience, and Eli&#8217;s eventual discernment. Literally and historically, the Lord audibly summons the boy a third time, preparing to raise up a faithful prophet. The passage calls readers to be attentive, responsive, and guided by mature counsel so that when God speaks through His living Word, we are able to answer, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.</span>--The whole story of the eventful night is told so naturally, the supernatural wonderfully interwoven with the common life of the sanctuary, that we forget, as we read, the strangeness of the events recorded. The sleeping child is awakened by a voice uttering his name. He naturally supposes it is his half-blind old master summoning him. The same thing occurs a second and a third time. Then it flashed upon Eli the boy had had no dream. We can well fancy the old man, when Samuel again came in, asking, "Where did the voice you thought was mine come from?" and the boy would reply, "From your chamber, master." And the old high priest would remember that in the same direction, only at the extremity of the sanctuary, behind the veil, was the Ark and the seat of God. Was, then, the glory of the Lord shining there? and did the voice as in old days proceed from that sacred golden throne? Se he bade his pupil go to his chamber again, and if the voice spoke to him again, to answer, not Eli, but the invisible King--"Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - But Eli was neither so inexperienced, nor so lost to all sense of Jehovah being the immediate ruler of Israel, as not to perceive, when Samuel came to him the third time, that the matter was Divine. Possibly he recalled to mind the visit of the man of God, and had some presage of what the message might be. At all events he bade Samuel lie calmly down again, because the best preparation for hearing God's voice is obedience and trustful submission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once again,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
