This period occurs after David has been relentlessly pursued by King Saul, who sees him as a threat to his throne. Seeking refuge among the Philistines, traditional enemies of Israel, highlights David's desperation and strategic thinking. The Philistines were a powerful group located in the coastal region of Canaan, known for their advanced iron technology and military prowess. David's presence in their land suggests a temporary alliance or at least a truce, which is unusual given the historical enmity between the Israelites and the Philistines. This move also foreshadows David's complex relationship with foreign nations during his future reign as king.<p><b>amounted to a year and four months.</b><br>The specific duration of David's stay&#8212;one year and four months&#8212;indicates a significant period of time, allowing for the development of relationships and strategies. This timeframe suggests that David was able to establish a degree of stability and influence within Philistine society. It also implies that David's presence was tolerated, if not welcomed, by Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, who saw potential benefits in having David as an ally. This period allowed David to gather intelligence and resources, which would later aid him in his eventual ascension to the throne of Israel. The length of time also reflects a period of testing and preparation for David, as he navigates life away from his homeland and the pressures of Saul's pursuit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

This &#8220;time&#8221; marks a distinct season between fleeing Saul and ascending the throne (compare <a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timetable is precise; just as He foretold Israel&#8217;s sojourn in Egypt to the very day (<a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40-41</a>), He also marks David&#8217;s months among the Philistines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that David lived</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lived&#8221; shows David settled, not merely visited.

Like Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>), his identity remained intact, demonstrating that circumstances cannot nullify divine calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Philistine territory</b><p>&#8226; The Philistines were historic enemies of Israel (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), yet God used this unlikely place as a refuge.

The Hebrew expression, translated "a year," is a singular one: <span class= "ital">yamim</span>--literally, <span class= "ital">days</span>--a collective term, used in <a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm" title="And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.">Leviticus 25:29</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm" title="And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.">1Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-19.htm" title="Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.">1Samuel 2:19</a>, &c., to signify a term or period of days which amounted to a full year. This year and four months were among the darkest days of David's life. He was sorely tried, it is true; but he had adopted the very course his bitterest foes would have wished him to select. In open arms, apparently leagued with the deadliest foes of Israel, like an Italian condottiere or captain of free lances of the Middle Ages, he had taken service and accepted the wages of that very Philistine city whose champion he once had slain in the morning of his career. At last his enemies at the court of Saul had reason when they spoke of him as a traitor. From the curt recital in this chapter, which deals with the saddest portion of David's career, we shall see that while he apparently continued to make common cause with the enemies of his race, he still used his power to help, and not to injure, his countrymen; but the price he paid for his patriotism was a life of falsehood, stained, too, with deeds of fierce cruelty, shocking even in these rough, half-barbarous times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A full year.</span> Hebrew, "days."
