As king, Saul was recognizable, and his need to hide his identity underscores the gravity of his situation. This act of disguise is significant because it contrasts with his earlier anointing as king, where he was publicly chosen by God. The use of disguise also reflects Saul's spiritual decline, as he resorts to deception to seek guidance, contrary to God's law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). This moment foreshadows the ultimate loss of his kingship and favor with God.<p><b>and he set out with two of his men</b><br>Saul's decision to take only two men with him suggests secrecy and urgency. In biblical narratives, the number two often signifies witness or testimony (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), but here it may indicate the minimal support Saul has in his quest, reflecting his isolation. The presence of these men also highlights Saul's reliance on human counsel rather than divine guidance, a recurring theme in his reign.<p><b>They came to the woman at night</b><br>The cover of night symbolizes secrecy and the hidden nature of Saul's actions. Nighttime in biblical literature often represents evil or wrongdoing (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). Saul's visit to the woman, known as the medium of Endor, is a direct violation of God's commands against consulting mediums (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>). The choice of night for this encounter underscores the illicit nature of his actions and his departure from God's light.<p><b>and Saul said, &#8220;Consult a spirit for me.</b><br>Saul's request to consult a spirit marks a significant departure from his earlier efforts to rid Israel of mediums and spiritists (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>). This act of seeking forbidden spiritual guidance highlights his desperation and lack of faith in God's provision. It also reflects the spiritual void in Saul's life, as he turns to the occult for answers rather than seeking repentance and reconciliation with God.<p><b>Bring up for me the one I name.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's demand to bring up a specific spirit indicates his desire for control and specific guidance, likely seeking Samuel, the prophet who had guided him in the past. This request reveals Saul's misunderstanding of God's sovereignty and the nature of true prophecy. It also foreshadows the tragic outcome of his reign, as seeking guidance from the dead is ultimately futile and leads to his downfall. This moment contrasts with the New Testament's emphasis on seeking wisdom from God through prayer and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is seeking guidance from a medium after God has stopped answering him through prophets or dreams.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Medium) of Endor</a></b><br>A woman who practices necromancy, living in Endor, whom Saul seeks out to summon the spirit of the prophet Samuel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>A location in ancient Israel, known here as the place where Saul seeks forbidden spiritual guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_men.htm">Two Men</a></b><br>Saul's companions on this secretive and forbidden mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nighttime_visit.htm">Nighttime Visit</a></b><br>The event takes place at night, symbolizing secrecy and perhaps the darkness of Saul's spiritual state.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's actions demonstrate the dangers of turning away from God's commands.

The smaller the group, the easier to hide sin&#8212;and the easier to ignore godly counsel (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They came to the woman at night</b><p>&#8226; Darkness throughout Scripture often accompanies ungodly deeds (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/job/24-15.htm">Job 24:15</a>). Saul, once anointed to &#8220;banish darkness&#8221; from Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>), now walks in it.<p>&#8226; Nighttime travel also shows desperation. God had refused him by dreams, Urim, and prophets (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>), so he seeks answers in forbidden places, echoing <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>: &#8220;Should not a people consult their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Saul said, &#8220;Consult a spirit for me.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The request violates explicit commands: &#8220;Do not turn to spiritists or mediums&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31, 20</a>:6; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, Saul himself had earlier expelled mediums from the land (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>), yet now asks the very practice he outlawed. This reveals the slippery slope of partial obedience&#8212;eventually, compromise circles back to ensnare the compromiser (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; His words expose a heart more interested in information than in repentance. True prophets called Israel to obedience; Saul seeks a shortcut.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Bring up for me the one I name.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s demand points to Samuel, the prophet who had earlier declared, &#8220;Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). Rather than submitting to that verdict, Saul tries to reopen the case through forbidden means.<p>&#8226; This tactic fails. When Samuel appears, his message is unchanged: &#8220;Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>).

Each step illustrates the futility of hiding from the Lord, the danger of seeking forbidden counsel, and the unchangeable certainty of God&#8217;s earlier word. Obedience preserves; disobedience isolates.

The king would, he thought, be unknown in the darkness and disguise when he came to the witch's dwelling, and there was, too, a far greater probability of his escaping his Philistine foes, whose army lay between him and the village of En-dor.<p><span class= "bld">Divine unto me by the familiar spirit.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">divine unto me by the ob. </span>Keil's remark is interesting: "Prophesying by the <span class= "ital">ob </span>was probably performed by calling up a departed spirit from Sheol, and obtaining prophecies--i.e., disclosures--concerning one's own fate through the medium of such a spirit." No other commentator touches on the <span class= "ital">ob </span>here, and Keil leaves it in doubt as to whether he considered the <span class= "ital">ob </span>was some special spirit devoted to the service of the mistress of the <span class= "ital">ob, </span>or the spirit or soul of one already dead, who, through some occult power, was to be brought back again for a season to this earth. As far as we can judge of these old mysteries, the sorcerer or sorceress possessed, or was supposed to possess, a "familiar." Through the aid of this "familiar," the departed spirit was compelled or induced to re-visit this world, and to submit to certain questioning. The Hebrew rendered "divine unto me" is of Syriac origin, like most of those words describing illicit vaticinations.--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary. </span>This miserable power, if it did exist, was one of the things the Israelites learned from the original inhabitants of Canaan. These "black" arts, as they have been called, have, in all ages, in every degree of civilisation, always had an extraordinary fascination for men. It is well known that even in our own "cultured age" similar pretensions are put forth, and the dead are still invoked, summoned, and questioned, as they were in the half-barbarous age when Saul and his companions, in their desperate strait, sought the witch of En-dor.<p><span class= "bld">And bring me him up.</span>--The popular idea has always been that Sheol, the place of departed spirits, is somewhere <span class= "ital">beneath </span>the ground or earth on which we live, just as heaven, the abode of God and His holy angels, is in a region <span class= "ital">above </span>the earth. St. Paul speaks in this popular language (<a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>), where he refers to the lower parts of the earth as the abode of departed spirits. Hence we have here, "bring me him up." The Christian Church, Bishop Wordsworth reminds us, has adopted this language into her creeds, where she says that Christ in His human soul <span class= "ital">descended </span>into hell (Hades). Keil well remarks on this human idea of what is "above" and "below": "With our modes of thought, which are so bound up with time and space, it is impossible to represent to ourselves in any other way the difference and contrast between blessedness with God and shade-life in death."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">disguised himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;&#7717;ap&#183;p&#234;&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
