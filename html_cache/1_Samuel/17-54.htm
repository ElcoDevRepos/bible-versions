In ancient Near Eastern culture, taking the head of a defeated enemy was a common practice symbolizing total victory and the end of the enemy's threat. This act also served as a tangible proof of triumph. David's victory is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, demonstrating God's power working through unlikely individuals. It prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as David, a shepherd, defeats a seemingly invincible foe, much like Jesus, the Good Shepherd, conquers sin.<p><b>and brought it to Jerusalem</b><br>At the time of David's battle with Goliath, Jerusalem was not yet the capital of Israel; it was still a Jebusite city. This action foreshadows David's future conquest of Jerusalem and its establishment as the political and spiritual center of Israel. Bringing Goliath's head to Jerusalem symbolizes the future unification and centralization of the kingdom under David's rule. It also points to the eventual establishment of Jerusalem as the city of David and the site of the temple, where God's presence would dwell among His people.<p><b>and he put Goliath&#8217;s weapons in his own tent</b><br>By placing Goliath's weapons in his tent, David claims the spoils of victory. This act signifies the transfer of power and strength from the Philistines to Israel. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the theme of God empowering the weak to overcome the strong, as seen throughout Scripture. The weapons serve as a personal reminder of God's deliverance and faithfulness. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who disarms the powers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross, as described in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd who would later become King of Israel.

God&#8217;s victories are meant to be seen, remembered, and celebrated, strengthening faith for the battles that still lie ahead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54) <span class= "bld">The head of the Philistine.</span>--There is no real difficulty here, for although the fortress of Jebus, on Mount Zion, was in the hands of the Jebusites, and continued to be so until David captured the stronghold, many years later, the city of Jerusalem already belonged to the Israelites. (See <a href="/joshua/15-63.htm" title="As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Judges 1:21</a>.) This "place of arms" was naturally selected for the home of the famous trophy, being the nearest stronghold to the scene of the victory.<p><span class= "bld">But he put his armour in his tent.</span>--<span class= "ital">Ohel, </span>the Hebrew word rendered here "tent," is the ancient word for "dwelling." If we understand that David kept for the present the armour of his mighty adversary, we must suppose he took it to his dwelling at Bethlehem, and after a time presented it to the sanctuary at Nob. In <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.">1Samuel 21:9</a> we read of the "sword of Goliath wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod." Abarbanel, however, with great probability, believes that by the expression "in his tent" the "tabernacle of Jehovah" is meant--"<span class= "ital">His </span>tabernacle," so termed pointedly by the compiler of the history, because David, in later days, with great ceremony, "pitched it" in his own city (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">2Samuel 6:17</a>). In <a href="/acts/15-16.htm" title="After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:">Acts 15:16</a> the writer of this New Testament Book expressly calls the sacred tent "the Tabernacle of David." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David...brought it to Jerusalem</span>. This is an anticipation of later history. The Jebusites at this time held Jerusalem; but when David had taken it from them, he removed the head of Goliath thither, and the narrator, following the usual custom of Hebrew historians, mentions the ultimate fate of this trophy here (see on 1 Samuel 16:21). <span class="cmt_word">He put his armour in his tent.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he carried it to his home (see on 1 Samuel 2:35; 4:10; 13:2, etc.), where it became his private property. The mistranslation of <span class="accented">camp</span> by <span class="accented">tents</span> in ver. 53 might lead an English reader to suppose that it meant a tent in the camp of Israel; but most probably the men all slept under their wagons. Abravanel supposes that by David's tent was meant the tabernacle of Jehovah, but this would surely have been stated more fully. Either, however, now, or at some later period, David must have presented the sword as an offering to the tabernacle, as it was laid up at Nob, whence he took it with him in his flight (see <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>).
