Gilgal was a key location for Israel, serving as a base during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was here that Saul was confirmed as king (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>). Samuel's leaving indicates a shift in divine favor and leadership, as Saul's disobedience had just been rebuked (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>).<p><b>and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin.</b><br>Gibeah, Saul's hometown, was located in the tribal territory of Benjamin. This area was central to Saul's early reign and military operations (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). The movement from Gilgal to Gibeah signifies a return to Saul's base of power, yet it also foreshadows the challenges Saul will face, as Gibeah later becomes a place of conflict and moral failure (Judges 19-20).<p><b>And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.</b><br>The reduction of Saul's forces to about six hundred men highlights the dire situation Israel faced against the Philistines. This number is reminiscent of Gideon's reduced army (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>), suggesting a reliance on divine intervention rather than military might. Saul's dwindling numbers contrast with the vast Philistine forces, emphasizing the need for faith and obedience to God, which Saul lacked. This moment foreshadows the eventual rise of David, who would trust in God for victory despite overwhelming odds (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel who anointed Saul as the first king.

By departing, Samuel demonstrates that fellowship with God&#8217;s prophet cannot continue while the king persists in disobedience&#8212;echoing <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>, &#8220;Can two walk together unless they are agreed?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s withdrawal is not spite; it is a sober declaration that God&#8217;s word stands. It previews later moments when prophetic figures distance themselves from unfaithful leadership (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gibeah is Saul&#8217;s hometown and royal outpost (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>; 11:4). By heading there, Samuel positions himself where future events will unfold, indicating that God&#8217;s purposes continue&#8212;even if Saul is faltering.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;went up&#8221; hints at elevation, both geographic and spiritual. While Saul&#8217;s authority is sliding downward, God&#8217;s prophet moves upward, maintaining the higher ground of obedience (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The move also signals a strategic regrouping: Samuel remains within Benjaminite territory but removes himself from the immediate scene of rebellion, similar to Jesus leaving Nazareth for Capernaum when His message was rejected (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men</b><p>&#8220;And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier, Saul commanded 3,000 soldiers (<a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>).

Trust in numbers contrasts with trust in God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This numerical detail sets the stage for the next chapter&#8217;s victory initiated by Jonathan, underscoring that God can deliver &#8220;whether by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 15 marks a decisive turning point. Samuel&#8217;s exit from Gilgal announces divine displeasure; his ascent to Gibeah keeps the prophetic mission alive; Saul&#8217;s diminished army illustrates the cost of self-reliance. Together, the pieces show that true security lies not in location or numbers but in humble obedience to the Lord who remains faithful even when leaders falter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And Samuel arose.</span>--Although the close union between the prophet and the king was thus disturbed by the unhappy self-willed conduct of Saul, by which he virtually threw away the power which had been conferred on him, still Samuel does not as yet break off friendly relations with Saul. Perhaps the noble old man still hoped that the brilliant and gallant king would recognise his fatal error.<p>From Gilgal, we read, Samuel passed to Gibeah of Benjamin, the home of Saul: there, no doubt, he took counsel with and encouraged Jonathan, who was stationed there, and whose splendid gallantry was soon after to be called into action again.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul numbered the people.</span>--The disobedience of Saul had availed nothing. Instead of being able to lead a host against the Philistine army, the camp of Israel became deserted. Even his small division of regulars seems to have melted away; only six hundred answered to the despairing king's roll-call. It would seem as though the Divine punishment had begun already.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samuel... gat him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.</span> Samuel would pass by Gibeah on his way to his own home at Ramah; but he seems to have tarried there to encourage the people; and probably he carried instructions from Saul to Jonathan to unite his forces with him, as we next find the father and son there in company. Even if this be not so, yet friendly relations must have continued between Saul and Samuel, as the latter would otherwise certainly not have chosen Saul's home for his halting place; nor would he go thither without seeing Jonathan, and giving him aid and counsel. Saul numbered. See on 1 Samuel 11:8. After summoning the whole nation there did not remain with him even as many as a third of his selected band. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
