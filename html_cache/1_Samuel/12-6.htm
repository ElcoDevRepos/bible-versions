This moment is significant as it marks a transition from the period of judges to the monarchy with Saul as king. Samuel's role as a prophet is crucial, as he serves as God's mouthpiece, guiding the people according to divine will. His address is a reminder of God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>The LORD is the One who appointed Moses and Aaron</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereign choice and divine authority in selecting leaders for His people. Moses and Aaron were chosen to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, with Moses as the prophet and Aaron as the high priest. This appointment underscores the importance of divine calling and the roles of leadership in God's plan. It also highlights the continuity of God's guidance from the time of the Exodus to the present moment in Israel's history.<p><b>and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt</b><br>The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and God's power to save. It serves as a constant reminder of God's faithfulness and His covenant with Israel. This deliverance from Egypt is often seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus delivers humanity from the bondage of sin. The reference to "your fathers" connects the current generation with their ancestors, emphasizing the ongoing relationship between God and His people throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and last judge of Israel, who played a crucial role in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is central to the account as the divine authority and deliverer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Brother of Moses, appointed by God as the first high priest of Israel, assisting Moses in leading the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>God appoints leaders according to His divine plan and purpose.

The elders of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/12-5.htm" title="And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.">1Samuel 12:5</a>) had with one consent cried out, in reply to Samuel's solemn calling God and the king to witness, <span class= "ital">He is witness. </span>Then Samuel takes up their words with great emphasis, <span class= "ital">even the Eternal that advanced Moses, &c. </span>The English rendering greatly weakens the dramatic force of the original Hebrew. The LXX. has caught accurately the thought by supplying the word "witness ": thus, <span class= "ital">The Lord is witness, &c.</span><p>The Exodus is mentioned in this and in many places in these ancient records of the people as the great call of love by which the Eternal assumed the sovereignty over Israel. The Talmud here comments: "It is the Lord that made Moses and Aaron" (<a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm" title="And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 12:6</a>); and it is said (<a href="/1_samuel/12-11.htm" title="And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.">1Samuel 12:11</a>), "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel." Scripture balances in the same scale the three least important with the three most important personages, in order to teach thee that Jerrubbaal in his generation was like Moses in his, Bedan (said to be Samson) like Aaron, and Jephthah like Samuel. Hence the most insignificant man, if appointed a ruler of the congregation, has the same authority as the most important personage.--Treatise <span class= "ital">Rosh-Hashanah, </span>fol. 25, Colossians 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is Jehovah that,</span> etc. In the Hebrew Jehovah is put absolutely, without any government, and the Septuagint rightly supplies <span class="accented">is witness.</span> Samuel had said, "Jehovah is witness against you;" the people in answer shouted the last word, "Witness" (see end of ver. 5, where <span class="accented">He is</span> is supplied). Then Samuel solemnly repeats Jehovah s name, saying, "Even Jehovah that advanced Moses and Aaron." This rapid interchange of words brings the whole scene vividly before us, whereas nothing could be tamer than the A.V. Out of the land of Egypt. Samuel begins with this as the first act of Jehovah as Israel's King; for the theocracy began with the deliverance from Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
