The word "Good" here signifies approval or acceptance. In ancient Israel, the New Moon was a significant time for communal gatherings and feasting, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10 and 28</a>:11-15. Saul's positive response would indicate that he harbors no ill will towards David, suggesting a temporary peace. This reflects the cultural importance of verbal affirmations in maintaining social harmony and the weight of a king's word in determining the safety of his subjects.<p><b>then your servant is safe,</b><br>David refers to himself as Jonathan's "servant," highlighting the humility and loyalty he feels towards Jonathan, despite being anointed as the future king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This phrase underscores the covenantal friendship between Jonathan and David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>. The concept of safety here is not just physical but also relational, as it pertains to David's standing with Saul and his place within the royal court. The assurance of safety is a recurring theme in the Psalms, often attributed to God's protection (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).<p><b>but if he is enraged,</b><br>Saul's potential anger is a critical indicator of his true intentions towards David. Saul's jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and God's favor upon him have been building since David's victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-9</a>). Anger in biblical terms often signifies a deeper spiritual or moral failing, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>, which warns of the destructive nature of anger. Saul's rage is a manifestation of his internal struggle and rejection of God's will, contrasting with the peace and righteousness that characterize David's relationship with God.<p><b>you will know he has evil intentions.</b><br>Jonathan's plan to discern Saul's intentions reveals the gravity of the situation. The term "evil intentions" reflects the biblical understanding of evil as a deviation from God's righteous path. Saul's intent to harm David is not just a personal vendetta but a rebellion against God's anointed. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's protection over His chosen ones, as seen in Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where God turns intended evil into good. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and protection found in Jesus Christ, who, like David, faced opposition and yet fulfilled God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

A calm, gracious response from Saul would signal that his heart has softened.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Saul could speak kindly about David when God&#8217;s Spirit restrained him (<a href="/1_samuel/19-6.htm">1 Samuel 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath,&#8221; underscoring how a peaceful word reveals a peaceful heart.<p>&#8226; Jesus later observes that &#8220;out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>), so Saul&#8217;s words will mirror what lies inside him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then your servant is safe,</b><p>&#8220;then your servant is safe&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/20-7.htm">1 Samuel 20:7</a>b) expresses David&#8217;s confidence that God can use even Saul&#8217;s attitude to protect him.<p>&#8226; Jonathan calls himself David&#8217;s &#8220;servant&#8221; again (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-8.htm">1 Samuel 20:8</a>), highlighting their covenant loyalty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a> captures David&#8217;s outlook: &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When a ruler acts justly, his subjects rejoice (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).

<a href="/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever is hot-tempered exalts folly,&#8221; describing exactly what Saul exhibits when jealous anger rules him instead of the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will know he has evil intentions.</b><p>&#8220;you will know he has evil intentions&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/20-7.htm">1 Samuel 20:7</a>d) gives Jonathan the purpose of the test: discernment.<p>&#8226; Saul had already ordered David&#8217;s death once (<a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>); a fresh surge of rage would confirm that murderous plot.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a> contrasts &#8220;the thoughts of the righteous&#8221; with &#8220;the counsels of the wicked,&#8221; and Saul&#8217;s plotting places him in the latter group.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a> urges believers to &#8220;hate what is evil; cling to what is good,&#8221; the very choice Jonathan must make concerning his father&#8217;s scheme.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/20-7.htm">1 Samuel 20:7</a> offers a straightforward yardstick: Saul&#8217;s immediate reaction will unmask his heart.<p>&#8226;
