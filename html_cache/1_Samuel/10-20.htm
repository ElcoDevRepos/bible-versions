This event marks a significant transition from the period of judges to the monarchy. The gathering of all the tribes signifies the unity and collective identity of Israel as God's chosen people. This assembly is reminiscent of other significant gatherings in Israel's history, such as the giving of the Law at Sinai. The process of selection by tribe underscores the importance of tribal identity in Israelite society and governance.<p><b>and the tribe of Benjamin was selected</b><br>The selection of the tribe of Benjamin is significant for several reasons. Benjamin was the smallest of the tribes, as noted in <a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a> and <a href="/judges/20-46.htm">Judges 20:46-48</a>, which highlights God's pattern of choosing the least likely candidates to fulfill His purposes, as seen with David and later with Jesus Christ, who was born in humble circumstances. The tribe's selection also fulfills the prophecy and divine plan, as Saul, Israel's first king, comes from Benjamin. This choice is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to work through unexpected means. Benjamin's location, near the center of Israel, may have also been strategic for uniting the tribes under a centralized monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.
