Covenants in the biblical context are solemn agreements, often involving God as a witness, which underscores the seriousness of their promise. This covenant reflects mutual loyalty and support, crucial during David's time of fleeing from King Saul. The act of making a covenant "before the LORD" indicates their recognition of God's sovereignty and presence in their relationship. This mirrors other biblical covenants, such as those between God and Abraham, emphasizing faithfulness and divine oversight. Jonathan's willingness to make this covenant, despite his father Saul's animosity towards David, demonstrates his understanding of God's plan for David's future kingship, aligning with the prophetic anointing of David by Samuel.<p><b>And David remained in Horesh,</b><br>Horesh, located in the wilderness of Ziph, served as a refuge for David during his flight from Saul. The geographical setting of Horesh, a rugged and remote area, provided natural protection and concealment. This period in David's life is marked by reliance on God's guidance and provision, as he navigates the challenges of being pursued by Saul. The wilderness experience is a recurring theme in Scripture, often symbolizing a time of testing and preparation, as seen in the lives of Moses and Jesus. David's stay in Horesh reflects his trust in God's protection and his strategic acumen in choosing a defensible location.<p><b>while Jonathan went home.</b><br>Jonathan's return home signifies his continued loyalty to his father Saul, despite his covenant with David. This dual allegiance highlights the tension Jonathan faced, balancing familial duty with his recognition of God's anointing on David. Jonathan's actions demonstrate his integrity and faith, as he supports David without betraying his father. This situation foreshadows the eventual transition of kingship from Saul to David, as Jonathan's support for David aligns with God's divine plan. Jonathan's departure also marks a poignant moment in their friendship, as it is one of their last recorded meetings before Jonathan's death, underscoring the sacrificial nature of true friendship and loyalty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

Scripture presents them as real historical figures whose friendship is grounded in a shared faith in the LORD (see <a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1&#8211;3</a>; 20:17).<p>- Their unity in the midst of danger foreshadows the New Testament call for believers to stand together even when the cost is high (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p>- Jonathan risks his own safety and reputation to meet David. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>made a covenant before the LORD.</b><p>- A covenant is more than a casual promise; it invokes God as witness and guarantor (<a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>).<p>- Earlier covenants between these two (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>; 20:14&#8211;17) are reaffirmed here, underscoring that genuine commitment should be renewed, not assumed.<p>- &#8220;Before the LORD&#8221; highlights accountability. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a> warns against vows made lightly; Jonathan and David take the opposite approach by sealing their pledge in God&#8217;s presence.<p>- David later honors this covenant by caring for Jonathan&#8217;s son Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1&#8211;7</a>), proving that promises made in faith must lead to practical obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And David remained in Horesh,</b><p>- Horesh (&#8220;forest&#8221;) in the wilderness of Ziph is not a vacation spot; it is rugged and exposed (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>- David stays where God has placed him, trusting divine protection rather than political maneuvering. The superscription to <a href="/bsb/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a> connects that psalm&#8217;s cry for help to this very time, revealing David&#8217;s heart while he remained.<p>- For believers, remaining faithful in a hard place often precedes elevation; David&#8217;s wilderness season shapes him into the shepherd-king (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while Jonathan went home.</b><p>- Jonathan returns to the palace, stepping back into Saul&#8217;s orbit while carrying fresh loyalty to David (<a href="/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>).<p>- His departure shows that fulfilling God-honoring commitments sometimes involves quietly serving in difficult contexts rather than escaping them.<p>- Jonathan&#8217;s path eventually leads to his death in battle alongside Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>), yet his faithfulness leaves a legacy. <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32&#8211;40</a> notes that some heroes of faith &#8220;did not receive what was promised&#8221; in their lifetime, yet God commends them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-18.htm">1 Samuel 23:18</a> records a real historic moment in which David and Jonathan renew a God-centered covenant, model sacrificial friendship, and embrace their appointed roles&#8212;David in exile, Jonathan at court&#8212;while trusting the LORD to honor their vow.
