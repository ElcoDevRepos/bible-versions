Ahijah, the priest, is a descendant of Eli, indicating the continuation of the priestly line despite the earlier judgment against Eli's house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-36</a>). This highlights the complex relationship between the monarchy and the priesthood in Israel, where the king often sought divine guidance through the priest.<p><b>&#8220;Bring the ark of God.&#8221;</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people. Saul's request to bring the ark suggests a desire for divine guidance or favor in battle, reflecting a common practice of seeking God's will through sacred objects. However, this action can also be seen as presumptuous, as the ark was not typically used as a talisman in warfare. This echoes earlier events in <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>, where the Israelites brought the ark into battle against the Philistines, resulting in its capture due to their misplaced trust in the object rather than in God Himself.<p><b>(For at that time it was with the Israelites.)</b><br>This parenthetical note provides historical context, indicating that the ark was with the Israelites after being returned by the Philistines (1 Samuel 6). The ark's presence among the Israelites signifies a period of restored worship and divine favor, contrasting with the earlier period of its absence. This context underscores the importance of the ark in Israel's religious life and the belief in its power to influence the outcome of events. The presence of the ark also serves as a reminder of God's covenant promises and His faithfulness to His people, despite their frequent disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

Though Eli&#8217;s line has been judged (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30-35</a>), God still works through the priesthood He ordained.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s request shows that a king, no matter how powerful, should honor God-appointed mediators (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Sadly, Saul often wavers between reverence and rashness (compare <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>). This moment starts well: he seeks divine guidance before acting militarily.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring the ark of God</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Bring the ark of God.&#8217;&#8221; (14:18b)<p>&#8226; The ark represented the throne of the LORD Almighty among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Whenever the ark led Israel, the nation flourished&#8212;as when its advance parted the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-11.htm">Joshua 3:11-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel had once treated the ark like a good-luck charm and lost it to the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-11</a>). Saul risks repeating that error if his focus is on the object, not the LORD.<p>&#8226; Yet his instinct also reflects faith: he wants the visible sign of God&#8217;s presence on the battlefield, echoing Moses&#8217; cry, &#8220;Rise up, O LORD! May Your enemies be scattered&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that victory belongs to God, not to swords or numbers (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For at that time it was with the Israelites</b><p>&#8220;(For at that time it was with the Israelites.)&#8221; (14:18c)<p>&#8226; After the ark&#8217;s return from Philistia (<a href="/1_samuel/6-13.htm">1 Samuel 6:13-18</a>) it had rested in Kiriath-jearim (7:1-2). By Saul&#8217;s reign it was evidently mobile again, accompanying the army.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mercy is on display: though Israel had once abused the ark, He allows them to possess it once more, foreshadowing the patience He will show through every covenant failure (<a href="/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The parenthetical note grounds the narrative in history&#8212;meaning this isn&#8217;t a legend but a real moment when God&#8217;s tangible presence was among His covenant people (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underscores responsibility: with the ark in their midst, Israel must act in a manner worthy of God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul, sensing crisis, turns to the priest Ahijah and calls for the ark, seeking God&#8217;s guidance and presence before moving the army. The request highlights both his flickering faith and the ever-present danger of treating holy things superficially. The parenthetical reminder that the ark was actually with Israel grounds the story, showcases God&#8217;s patience, and stresses that true victory comes only when His people honor Him as the One who truly dwells among them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">And Saul said unto Ahiah . . .</span>--The LXX. renders here, "And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ephod; for he bore the ephod in those days before the children of Israel." This is a statement easily to be understood. Saul was in doubt what to do under the present emergency. Should he--seeing the panic that was evidently increasing in the Philistine camp, and knowing nothing of the cause, only that his son and the armour-bearer were missing--should he risk his little force, and, leaving his strong position, attack that great host of apparently panic-stricken enemies? So he sent for the high priest Ahijah, and bade him consult the Urim and Thummim in his ephod.<p>But the Hebrew and all the versions read as in our English Version, "Bring hither the Ark of God" What does this mean? Was the Ark, then, with that little band of Saul? We never before, or after, find the slightest hint that the sacred coffer ever left the "city of woods" (Kiriath-yearim) until David bore it to Zion. Then, again, the word preceding "Bring hither" is never used in connection with the Ark. No question or oracle could be asked of the Ark or by the Ark. The Urim and Thummim, whatever these mysterious objects were alone were used to give answers to questions solemnly asked by king and people, and this Urim and Thummim were connected, not with the Ark, but with the high-priestly ephod. On the whole, the reading of the LXX. probably represents the original Hebrew. The present Hebrew text, with the word "Ark," is, however, clearly of extreme antiquity; the second part of the verse is most likely an explanatory gloss of some ancient scribe. Josephus' account of this transaction shows us that he had before him a text corresponding to the LXX. His words are, "He bid the priest take the garment of his high priesthood and prophesy" (<span class= "ital">Antiq., </span>6 ? 3). Maurer prefers the present Hebrew text, for he says, At that supreme moment of danger Saul wanted not the advice of an oracle, but rather the help and encouragement which the presence of the sacred Ark would give to his handful of soldiers. But this would rather degrade Saul to the level of the superstitious Hophni and Phinehas, the wicked sons of Eli. who, it will be remembered, exposed and lost the sacred Ark in the fatal battle in which they perished. Saul, with all his faults, was a far nobler type of man than those profligate, though brave, priests.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
