As a prophet, Samuel's role was to listen to and act upon God's instructions. This obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Abraham, who also followed God's directives without hesitation. Samuel's actions demonstrate his faithfulness and trust in God's plan, even when the full picture was not revealed to him. This obedience is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of following God's will.<p><b>and went to Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, holds significant biblical importance. It is the birthplace of King David, whom Samuel is about to anoint, and later becomes the birthplace of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The town's name means "house of bread," which is symbolically significant as Jesus, the "bread of life," was born there. Bethlehem's role in biblical history underscores God's sovereign plan and the unfolding of His promises through seemingly humble beginnings.<p><b>When the elders of the town met him</b><br>The elders were the leaders and decision-makers in the town, responsible for maintaining order and justice. Their meeting with Samuel indicates the respect and authority he commanded as a prophet. In ancient Israel, elders played a crucial role in community life, often serving as judges and advisors. Their involvement in this narrative highlights the communal aspect of Israelite society and the importance of leadership in guiding the people according to God's laws.<p><b>they trembled and asked</b><br>The elders' trembling suggests a sense of fear or reverence. Prophets often brought messages of judgment or correction, so Samuel's unexpected visit could have been perceived as a sign of impending divine intervention. This reaction reflects the seriousness with which the Israelites regarded prophetic authority and the potential consequences of disobedience to God's commands. The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the awe and respect due to God's power and holiness.<p><b>&#8220;Do you come in peace?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals the elders' concern about the nature of Samuel's visit. In a time when prophets could deliver messages of both blessing and judgment, the inquiry reflects their desire for reassurance. The concept of peace, or "shalom," in Hebrew, encompasses not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of wholeness and well-being. This greeting underscores the hope for God's favor and the desire for harmony within the community. Samuel's peaceful mission to anoint David as king foreshadows the ultimate peace brought by Jesus, the Prince of Peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is obedient to God's command to anoint a new king, demonstrating his faithfulness and dedication to God's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who directs Samuel to go to Bethlehem to anoint David as the future king of Israel, showing His sovereign plan and choice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>A small town in Judah, significant as the birthplace of David and later Jesus, highlighting its importance in biblical history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_city.htm">Elders of the City</a></b><br>The leaders of Bethlehem who are initially fearful of Samuel's visit, indicating the weight and authority of Samuel's presence as a prophet.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/event_of_anointing.htm">Event of Anointing</a></b><br>This event sets the stage for David's anointing as king, a pivotal moment in Israel's history that aligns with God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Samuel's immediate action upon God's instruction teaches us the importance of obedience and trust in God's plan, even when the outcome is uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The choice of Bethlehem and David illustrates God's sovereign control over history and His ability to use humble beginnings for great purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_reverence.htm">Fear and Reverence</a></b><br>The elders' reaction to Samuel's arrival reminds us of the reverence due to God's messengers and the seriousness of God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_leadership.htm">Preparation for Leadership</a></b><br>David's anointing, though not immediate in its fulfillment, shows that God prepares His chosen leaders in His timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_intentions.htm">Peaceful Intentions</a></b><br>Samuel's assurance of peace upon his arrival encourages us to approach others with peace and clarity of purpose in our interactions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_16_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 16:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Samuel_s_obedience_daily_faith_impact.htm">How does Samuel's obedience in 1 Samuel 16:4 inspire your daily faith walk?
