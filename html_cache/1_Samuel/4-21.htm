This naming reflects the deep despair and sense of loss felt by the Israelites. Naming in biblical times often carried significant meaning, reflecting circumstances or prophetic insights. The mother of Ichabod, Phinehas's wife, chose this name to signify the tragic events surrounding the birth of her son.<p><b>saying, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel,&#8221;</b><br>The "glory" refers to the presence and favor of God, often associated with the Ark of the Covenant, which symbolized God's dwelling among His people. The departure of glory indicates a severe spiritual and national crisis. This phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, where the glory of the Lord departs from the temple, symbolizing judgment and the withdrawal of divine presence due to Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>because the ark of God had been captured</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was central to Israelite worship and represented God's covenant with His people. Its capture by the Philistines was not just a military defeat but a spiritual catastrophe, suggesting that God had allowed His people to be judged due to their disobedience and the corruption of the priesthood, as seen in the earlier chapters of 1 Samuel.<p><b>and her father-in-law and her husband had been killed.</b><br>Eli, the high priest, and his sons, Hophni and Phinehas, had been judged by God for their sins, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>. Their deaths marked the end of Eli's priestly line and highlighted the consequences of failing to honor God.

The very sound of the name will remind every listener that something precious has been lost.<p>&#8226; Her action is more than maternal sorrow; it is prophetic. The Lord is using this woman&#8217;s anguish to proclaim a theological truth to the whole nation (compare <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4&#8211;9</a>, where Hosea&#8217;s children preach by their names).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The glory has departed from Israel&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Glory&#8221; in Scripture points to God&#8217;s manifest presence&#8212;His weighty, dazzling nearness that once filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;35</a>) and later the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; To say it has &#8220;departed&#8221; signals an unspeakable loss: not a temporary military setback but a rupture in the covenant relationship (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60&#8211;61</a>).<p>&#8226; Her words echo earlier warnings: if Israel persisted in unfaithfulness, the Lord would &#8220;hide His face&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>). In this battle, that warning has become reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the ark of God had been captured</b><p>&#8226; The ark was the earthly throne of the invisible King (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>). Israel treated it as a lucky charm (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3&#8211;5</a>), but God will not be manipulated.<p>&#8226; Its seizure by the Philistines declares that Israel&#8217;s sin has forfeited divine protection. The capture shouts what the widow whispers: glory is gone.<p>&#8226; Even so, the coming chapters (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5&#8211;6</a>) will show the Lord needs no human army to reclaim His honor; He judges Dagon in his own temple and brings the ark home Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And her father-in-law and her husband had been killed</b><p>&#8226; Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas fell exactly as foretold (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30&#8211;34</a>). Their deaths underscore God&#8217;s righteousness: corruption in leadership will not be ignored.<p>&#8226; For the widow, the personal blows are crushing, yet she frames her grief around God&#8217;s glory rather than her own loss. Spiritual disaster outweighs family tragedy.<p>&#8226; Her perspective invites us to value God&#8217;s presence above every earthly relationship (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>). When He is displaced, everything else collapses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ichabod&#8217;s naming is a living sermon: Israel&#8217;s sin has driven away the manifested glory of God, evidenced by the ark&#8217;s capture and the fall of corrupt leaders. The verse warns that when people treat holy things lightly, the Lord may withdraw His felt presence&#8212;yet the larger narrative hints that He will act on His own to vindicate His glory and restore fellowship with a repentant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21-22) <span class= "bld">The glory is departed from Israel.</span>--This singular and circumstantial account of the death of the widow of Phinehas, the evil warrior-priest, the son of Eli, which follows directly after the story of the great national disaster, is introduced from the records of that sad time, not from any special interest in the hapless woman and her sad fate, but solely for the purpose of showing how deeply the heart of Israel was penetrated with a love for their God, His Tabernacle, and its sacred contents. It was not the intelligence of her husband's bloody end on the field of battle, or of her father-in-law's death on his throne, or the downfall of her house, which stirred her so painfully; she could have borne all this better than the news that the Ark of the Covenant was in the hands of the idolatrous enemies of God. Von Gerlach remarks that "the wife of this deeply corrupt man shows how penetrated the whole people then was with the sense of the value of its covenant with God."<p>The meaning of the term I-chabod is much disputed, owing to the doubt which hangs over the first syllable--"I" followed by "chabod." It is usually taken to mean a simple negative; "not:" chabod signifying "glory:" I-chabod thus represents "not glory:" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>there is no glory. Others render the "I" syllable as a query, "Where?" "Where is the glory?" the answer, of course, being, "It is nowhere." But the best rendering seems to be to understand the syllable "I" as an exclamation of bitter sorrow, "Alas !" The name then could be translated, <span class= "ital">"Alas! the glory."</span><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And she named</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
