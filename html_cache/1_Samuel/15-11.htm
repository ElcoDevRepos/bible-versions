In this context, it reflects God's sorrow over Saul's failure to fulfill his divine purpose. This does not imply a change in God's nature or plan, but rather a human way to express divine disappointment. Saul was chosen as king to lead Israel according to God's will, but his disobedience led to this divine lament. This echoes <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>, where God regretted making humanity due to their wickedness, highlighting the seriousness of sin.<p><b>for he has turned away from following Me</b><br>Saul's turning away signifies a deliberate choice to reject God's commands. This phrase indicates a breach in the covenant relationship between God and Saul. Saul's disobedience in sparing King Agag and the best of the Amalekite livestock (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>) exemplifies his failure to follow God's explicit instructions. This turning away is a recurring theme in Israel's history, where leaders and people often strayed from God's path, leading to consequences.<p><b>and has not carried out My instructions</b><br>God's instructions to Saul were clear: to completely destroy the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). Saul's partial obedience is seen as complete disobedience in God's eyes. This highlights the importance of full compliance with divine commands. The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, and their destruction was a divine judgment. Saul's failure to execute this judgment reflects a lack of reverence for God's authority.<p><b>And Samuel was distressed</b><br>Samuel's distress reveals his deep concern for Israel and its leadership. As a prophet, Samuel had anointed Saul and invested in his success. His distress also reflects the weight of his prophetic responsibility and the sorrow over Saul's failure. This emotional response underscores the gravity of Saul's disobedience and its impact on Israel's future.<p><b>and cried out to the LORD all that night</b><br>Samuel's response in prayer demonstrates his reliance on God in times of crisis. His all-night intercession indicates the seriousness of the situation and his desire for divine guidance. This act of crying out is a model of fervent prayer, showing a deep commitment to seeking God's will. It parallels other biblical figures who interceded for God's people, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>), highlighting the role of intercession in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who expresses regret over Saul's disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to his disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who anointed Saul as king and serves as God's messenger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Saul was made king, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>The people whom God commanded Saul to completely destroy as an act of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's failure to fully obey God's command demonstrates the gravity of partial obedience.

The passage calls believers to wholehearted obedience and compassionate prayer for those who stray, remembering that God&#8217;s sorrow over sin springs from His love and righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">It repenteth me . . . </span>--"God does not feel the pain of remorse (says St. Augustine in Psalms 131), nor is He ever deceived, so as to desire to correct anything in which He has erred. But as a man desires to make a change when he repents, so when God is said in Scripture to repent, we may expect a change from Him. He changed Saul's kingdom when it is said He repented of making him king."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p><span class= "bld">And it grieved Samuel</span>--"Many grave thoughts seem to have presented themselves at once to Samuel, and to have disturbed his mind when he reflected on the dishonour which would be inflicted upon the name of God, and the occasion which the rejection and deposition of Saul would furnish to wicked men for blaspheming the invisible King of Israel . . . For Saul had been chosen by God Himself from all the people, and called by Him to the throne; if, therefore, he was deposed, it seemed likely that the worship of God would be overturned, and the greatest disturbance ensue."--<span class= "ital">Calvin, quoted by Keil. </span>Abarbanel tells us respecting Samuel's grief that he was angry and displeased, because he loved Saul for his beauty and heroism, and as his own creature whom he had made king; and that he prayed all night because God had not revealed to him Saul's sin, and he wished to know why sentence was pronounced against him.<p><span class= "bld">And he cried unto the Lord all night.</span>--This was, no doubt, that "piercing shrill cry" peculiar to Samuel. With this strange cry he seems to have on many a solemn occasion spoken with his God. He is often in this book represented as thus "crying unto God." (See Stanley's <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Vol. I., 1 Samuel 18)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It repenteth me.</span> By the law of man's free will his concurrence is necessary in carrying out the Divine purpose, and consequently every man called to the execution of any such purpose undergoes a probation. God's purpose will be finally carried out, but each special instrument, if it prove unworthy, will be laid aside. This change of administration is always described in Scriptural language as God's repentance, possibly because the phrase contains also the idea of the Divine grief over the rebellious sinner. But though Saul and his dynasty were thus put aside, and no longer represented Jehovah, still Saul remained the actual king, because God works slowly by the natural sequence of cause and effect. Saul's ill-governed temper, and his hatred and malice towards David, were the means of bringing about his ruin. <span class="cmt_word">It grieved Samuel.</span> Hebrew, "it burned to Samuel," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he was angry and displeased. The same phrase occurs in <a href="/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>, where it is rendered "he was very angry." But with whom was Samuel vexed? Generally at the whole course of events, but especially with Saul. In choosing him he had hoped that, in addition to high military qualities, he would possess a religious and obedient heart. He had now obtained for him a second trial, and if, warned by his earlier failure, he had proved trustworthy all might have been well. Saul had too many noble gifts for Samuel to feel indifferent at the perversion of so great an intellect and so heroic a heart. But he was of a despotic temperament, and would bend to no will but his own; and so he had saved the best of the plunder to enrich the people, and Agag possibly as a proof of his personal triumph. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried unto Jehovah all night</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he offered an earnest prayer for forgiveness for Saul, and for a change in his heart. As Abravanel says, Samuel no doubt loved Saul for his beauty and heroism, and therefore prayed for him; but no change came in answer to his prayer, and as forgiveness is conditional upon man's repentance, Saul was not forgiven. It is remarkable how often Samuel is represented as "crying" unto God (see <a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8, 9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I regret</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1495;&#1463;&#1431;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#183;&#7717;am&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5162.htm">Strong's 5162: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sigh, breathe strongly, to be sorry, to pity, console, rue, to avenge</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have made Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1444;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(him&#183;la&#7733;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4427.htm">Strong's 4427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reign, inceptively, to ascend the throne, to induct into royalty, to take counsel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has turned away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from following Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;ray)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
