The Philistine, Goliath, represents the formidable enemy of Israel, and David's willingness to confront him is significant. This moment underscores David's faith and courage, contrasting with Saul's fear and hesitation. The confrontation is set in the Valley of Elah, a strategic location for battles between the Israelites and Philistines. David's actions foreshadow his future role as a leader who trusts in God, reminiscent of Joshua's leadership in the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>he said to Abner the commander of the army</b><br>Abner, Saul's cousin and commander, is a key military figure in Israel. His presence indicates the importance of the event. The inquiry to Abner suggests Saul's lack of familiarity with David, despite David's previous service in Saul's court as a musician and armor-bearer. This moment highlights the disconnect between Saul and David, which will grow as David rises in prominence. Abner's role as a military leader is crucial, as he later becomes a significant figure in the power struggles following Saul's death.<p><b>&#8220;Abner, whose son is this young man?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's question about David's lineage reflects the importance of family and heritage in ancient Israel. Knowing one's family background was crucial for understanding social status and potential alliances. David's father, Jesse, is from Bethlehem, a town with prophetic significance as the birthplace of the future Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). This inquiry also emphasizes David's youth and unexpected emergence as a hero, a theme that recurs throughout his life and points to the unexpected ways God chooses leaders.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as you live, O king,&#8221;</b><br>This oath underscores the seriousness of Abner's response and his respect for Saul's authority. The phrase reflects the cultural practice of swearing by the king's life, a common expression of loyalty and truthfulness in ancient Near Eastern societies. It also highlights the hierarchical structure of Israel's monarchy, with Saul at the top as God's anointed king, despite his spiritual failings.<p><b>Abner replied, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</b><br>Abner's lack of knowledge about David's identity suggests David's humble beginnings and the obscurity from which he rises. This ignorance also points to the divine orchestration of events, as God often chooses the least likely individuals to fulfill His purposes. The anonymity of David at this point contrasts with his future fame and foreshadows the hidden nature of Christ's early life before His public ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The visual detail grounds the narrative in real time and space, assuring readers that God works through concrete, observable events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said to Abner the commander of the army</b><p>&#8226; Abner, Saul&#8217;s cousin and highest military officer (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>; 26:5), stands beside his king, yet he has no solution for Goliath.<p>&#8226; By addressing Abner, Saul acknowledges the chain of command; however, the true deliverer stands outside that hierarchy.<p>&#8226; The contrast between human leadership and divine empowerment mirrors later moments when military strength proves insufficient without the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Abner, whose son is this young man?"</b><p>&#8226; Saul is not asking David&#8217;s name but his lineage.

Royal courts often included many attendants; familiarity with one role did not guarantee knowledge of personal heritage.<p>&#8226; The question underscores God&#8217;s pattern of raising up unlikely families&#8212;Jesse&#8217;s youngest son, from Bethlehem, the town later linked to the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"As surely as you live, O king," Abner replied, "I do not know."</b><p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s respectful oath (&#8220;As surely as you live&#8221;) affirms Saul&#8217;s authority while admitting ignorance. Even the commander lacks vital information, emphasizing David&#8217;s obscurity up to this moment (<a href="/1_samuel/18-18.htm">1 Samuel 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The unknown status of David&#8217;s house magnifies the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty: God does not depend on renowned pedigrees to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; This confession sets the stage for David&#8217;s post-victory introduction to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/17-57.htm">1 Samuel 17:57-58</a>), where the shepherd&#8217;s lineage becomes central to future covenant promises (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a> captures a pivotal pause in the narrative: the fearful king watches faith in action, seeks pedigree information from his highest officer, and discovers that neither royal authority nor military command can account for God&#8217;s choice. The verse underlines David&#8217;s humble obscurity, Saul&#8217;s growing curiosity, and the Lord&#8217;s pattern of elevating the lowly to fulfill His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(55) <span class= "bld">Whose son is this youth?</span>--A grave difficulty, at first sight, indisputably exists here. It is briefly this. In the preceding chapter (<a href="/context/1_samuel/17-18.htm" title="And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.">1Samuel 17:18-23</a>), David, the son of Jesse, is chosen to play before the mentally sick king; his playing relieved the sufferer, who became attached to the young musician, and in consequence appointed him to a position about his person that certainly would have involved a lengthened, if not a continuous, residence at the court. In this and the following verses we read how this same David, at the time of his great exploit, was apparently unknown to the king and to Abner, the captain of the host. The LXX., fully conscious of the difficulty, determined to solve it by boldly, if not wisely, cutting the knot. They literally expunged from their version all the later passages which they could not easily bring into harmony with the earlier. The Greek Version, then, simply omits these four last verses of 1 Samuel 17, together with the first five verses of 1 Samuel 18, and the whole of the section <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-12.htm" title="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.">1Samuel 17:12-31</a>.<p>Various ingenious explanations have been suggested by scholars.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) The mental state of Saul when David played before him was such that the king failed to recognise him on the present occasion, and Abner probably had never seen him before.<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) Some length of time had elapsed since his last visit to the court, and as he was then in very early manhood, he had, so to speak, grown, in a comparatively speaking short space of time, out of Saul's memory.<p>(c) The purpose of Saul's inquiry was <span class= "ital">not </span>to find out who David was--that he knew well already--but to ascertain the position and general circumstances of the young hero's father, as, according to the promise (in <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.">1Samuel 17:25</a>), in the event of his success (which evidently the king confidently looked for), the father of the champion and his family would receive extraordinary honours.<p>The real solution of the difficulty probably lies in the fact that, as has been before stated, this and the other historical books of the Old Testament were made up by the inspired compiler from well-authenticated traditions current in Israel, and most probably preserved in the archives of the great prophetic schools. (See Notes on <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm" title="But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.">1Samuel 17:15</a>.) There were, no doubt, many of these traditions connected with the principal events of David's early career. Two here were selected which, to a certain extent, <span class= "ital">covered the same ground. </span>The first--preserved, no doubt, in some prophetic school where music and poetry were especially cultivated--narrates the influence which David acquired over Saul through his great gift of music. The power of music and poetry in Saul's mental disease was evidently the great point of interest to the original writer of <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1Samuel 16:14-23</a>. Now, in the narrative contained in these ten verses <span class= "ital">no note of time </span>occurs. The events related evidently were spread over a considerable, possibly over a very long, period. The afflicted king might have seen the young musician perhaps in a darkened tent once or twice before the Goliath combat, but the great intimacy described in <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.">1Samuel 16:21-23</a>, we may well assume, belonged to a period subsequent to the memorable combat with the giant. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 55-58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner, whose son is this youth?</span> Hebrew, "lad," <span class="accented">na'ar.</span> We have seen that the narrative in <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> carries the history of David's relations with Saul down to a much later period, and that in ver. 15 of this chapter David is represented as not dwelling continuously at Saul's court, but as having returned to Bethlehem and resumed his pastoral occupations there, whence he would be summoned back in case of the recurrence of Saul's malady. It is plain from what is stated here that David had not thus far spent time enough at Gibeah to be personally well known either to Saul or his officers (see note on ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Stripling</span>. Not <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, but <span class="accented">alem</span>, the masculine of the word <span class="accented">almah</span>, used in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. It means a young man fully grown, and arrived at the age to marry, and so is more definite than <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, which Saul uses in ver. 58. <span class="cmt_word">As David returned,</span> etc. Abner, as captain of the host, would naturally watch the combat, and as soon as it was possible would bring the young warrior into the king's presence. But what is recorded here could have taken place only after the pursuit of the Philistines was over, and really these five verses should be united with ch. 17, as their object is to introduce the account of the love. of Jonathan for David. Starting then with the inquiry made by the king of Abner, asking for fuller information as to the young man's parentage, the historian then tells how after the chase he was brought before Saul, and then, in <a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a>, that the result of their conversation was the warm love that henceforward knit together these two kindred souls. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-55.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had watched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;ir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k &#124;
