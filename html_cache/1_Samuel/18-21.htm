In ancient Israel, marriages often served political purposes, solidifying alliances or consolidating power. Saul's intention here is not to honor David but to manipulate the situation to his advantage. This reflects the complex dynamics of royal marriages in the ancient Near East, where personal relationships were often secondary to political strategy.<p><b>&#8220;so that she may be a snare to him,&#8221;</b><br>Saul's plan is to use his daughter as a means to entrap David. The term "snare" suggests a trap or a stumbling block, indicating Saul's desire to see David fall into misfortune. This reflects Saul's growing jealousy and fear of David, who is gaining popularity and favor among the people. The use of family members as pawns in political schemes was not uncommon in ancient times, highlighting the often ruthless nature of royal politics.<p><b>&#8220;and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&#8221;</b><br>Saul hopes that by marrying his daughter, David will be drawn into conflicts with the Philistines, Israel's perennial enemies. The Philistines were a significant threat during Saul's reign, and Saul's intention is to have David killed in battle. This reflects Saul's desperation to eliminate David, whom he sees as a rival to his throne. The Philistines' presence in the narrative underscores the constant external threats faced by Israel and the need for strong leadership.<p><b>So Saul said to David, &#8220;For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.&#8221;</b><br>This statement refers to Saul's previous offer of his elder daughter, Merab, to David, which did not come to fruition (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-19</a>). Saul's repeated offer indicates his persistent attempts to ensnare David. The phrase "for a second time" highlights Saul's manipulative tactics and his determination to use marriage as a means to control David. This also foreshadows the ongoing tension between Saul and David, which is a central theme in the narrative of 1 Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who becomes increasingly jealous and fearful of David's rising popularity and success.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness and bravery, particularly in defeating Goliath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Saul's daughter, whom Saul offers to David as a wife, intending to use her as a snare.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A perennial enemy of Israel, whom Saul hopes will be the downfall of David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_proposal.htm">Marriage Proposal</a></b><br>Saul's offer of his daughter Michal to David, which is a strategic move rather than a genuine gesture of goodwill.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_manipulation.htm">The Dangers of Manipulation</a></b><br>Saul's use of his daughter as a pawn highlights the destructive nature of manipulation and deceit.

This corruption highlights the king&#8217;s spiritual decline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&#8221;</b><p>Saul wants Philistine swords to accomplish what his own cannot.<p>&#8226; He had already reasoned this way: &#8220;Let the hand of the Philistines be against him&#8221; (18:17).<p>&#8226; The coming bride-price of one hundred foreskins (18:25) reveals the same plot.<p>&#8226; Yet every time David meets the Philistines, God grants victory (19:8; 23:1&#8211;5). The Lord turns the king&#8217;s murderous plan into further proof of David&#8217;s divine protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;So Saul said to David,&#8221;</b><p>The private scheme becomes a public offer.<p>&#8226; Saul masks malice with smooth words, reminiscent of the serpent&#8217;s subtlety (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; David, still serving loyally (18:5, 14), hears the king&#8217;s voice&#8212;but God hears the king&#8217;s heart (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.&#8221;</b><p>A repeated invitation exposes Saul&#8217;s instability and God&#8217;s steady purpose.<p>&#8226; First offer: Merab (18:17&#8211;19). Second offer: Michal (18:21).<p>&#8226; David responds with humility (18:23), never grasping at the throne God has promised.<p>&#8226; Later, after Saul&#8217;s death, David insists on Michal&#8217;s return (<a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm">2 Samuel 3:13</a>), showing that even Saul&#8217;s treachery cannot cancel a covenant once made.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a> pulls back the curtain on Saul&#8217;s heart.

Yet every strand of his scheme weaves into God&#8217;s larger design: David is preserved, the Philistines are defeated, and Saul&#8217;s own decline accelerates.
