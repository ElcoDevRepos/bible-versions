Their decision to reveal themselves to the Philistine outpost is a bold and strategic move. In the context of ancient warfare, outposts were critical for surveillance and defense. Jonathan's faith-driven initiative contrasts with the fear and hesitation of the Israelite army. This act of faith can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of stepping out in faith, trusting in God's deliverance (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><b>who exclaimed, &#8220;Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines' reaction highlights their perception of the Israelites as weak and cowardly, hiding in fear. This reflects the dire situation of Israel at the time, as they were oppressed by the Philistines and lacked proper weapons (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). The term "Hebrews" is used by the Philistines in a derogatory manner, emphasizing their disdain. This scenario echoes the theme of God using the weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). The imagery of coming out of hiding can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual awakening and courage, akin to the resurrection theme where life emerges from the grave.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

Jonathan had just said, &#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few&#8221; (verse 6).<p>&#8226; Stepping forward invites either help or hostility; Jonathan trusts the former. Compare Gideon breaking cover in obedience (Jud 7:19-21) and Elisha calmly facing a superior force because the unseen army of God was with him (<a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a> captures the heartbeat of this moment: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the outpost of the Philistines</b><p>&#8226; An &#8220;outpost&#8221; (garrison) is a first-line stronghold&#8212;humanly the worst place for two Israelites to appear.<p>&#8226; Jonathan deliberately targets the spear-point of enemy power, echoing his earlier strike on another Philistine outpost (<a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God often calls His people to confront, not evade, entrenched evil: see David running toward Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>) and Elijah facing down Baal&#8217;s prophets on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21-40</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting underscores the theme: faith does not wait for ideal conditions; it acts where the battle is fiercest (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who exclaimed,</b><p>&#8226; The Philistine guards react instantly; vigilance is high because Israel&#8217;s army has been scattered (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their cry shows both surprise and scorn. The world routinely misreads the moves of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Pharaoh&#8217;s army misjudged Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>), these soldiers misjudge Jonathan&#8217;s boldness. God allows the enemy&#8217;s overconfidence to pave the way for divine victory (1 <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The taunt recalls Israel&#8217;s earlier fear: &#8220;Some Hebrews hid themselves in caves, thickets, cliffs, cellars, and cisterns&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Mockery aims to belittle faith, yet it inadvertently acknowledges a shift&#8212;Hebrews are no longer hiding. Compare Sanballat&#8217;s ridicule of the wall builders (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; God delights to reverse expectations: those written off as weak emerge as instruments of His power (<a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The Philistines&#8217; sneer sets up their downfall (<a href="/1_samuel/14-12.htm">1 Samuel 14:12-15</a>). Their worldview cannot fathom a God who fights for His people (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan and his armor-bearer step out of concealment into enemy view, declaring faith in a God who saves &#8220;by many or by few.&#8221; Their appearance at the Philistine outpost exposes the enemy&#8217;s scorn and overconfidence, yet it also signals the turning of the tide.
