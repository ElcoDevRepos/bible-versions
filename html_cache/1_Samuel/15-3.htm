They were long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them at Rephidim shortly after the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). This command to attack is a continuation of God's judgment against them for their opposition to Israel. The Amalekites symbolize persistent sin and opposition to God's people, representing spiritual battles believers face.<p><b>and devote to destruction all that belongs to them.</b><br>The term "devote to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) indicates a complete consecration to God, often through destruction. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, signifying that the spoils of war were not for personal gain but were to be wholly given over to God. This command underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for total separation from anything that leads to idolatry or rebellion against God.<p><b>Do not spare them,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the judgment. Sparing any part of what God has devoted to destruction would be an act of disobedience. It highlights the importance of complete obedience to God's commands, reflecting the seriousness of sin and the need for purity among God's people.<p><b>but put to death men and women, children and infants,</b><br>This difficult command reflects the severity of God's judgment against sin and the totality of the Amalekites' corruption. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The inclusion of all ages and genders indicates the complete eradication of the Amalekite culture, which was deeply opposed to God.<p><b>oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.</b><br>The destruction of livestock further emphasizes the totality of the judgment. In ancient cultures, livestock represented wealth and sustenance. By destroying these, God was ensuring that nothing of the Amalekite culture or economy would remain. This act also prevented Israel from profiting from the spoils, reinforcing the idea that the victory was God's alone and not for personal gain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel, tasked with executing God's command against the Amalekites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who conveys God's message to Saul, representing God's authority and guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe and long-standing enemies of Israel, known for their opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalek.htm">Amalek</a></b><br>The region or people group that Saul is commanded to destroy completely as an act of divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command.htm">God's Command</a></b><br>The divine directive given to Saul to utterly destroy the Amalekites as a form of judgment for their past sins against Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The command to destroy the Amalekites underscores the severity of sin and God's judgment against persistent rebellion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god.htm">Obedience to God</a></b><br>Saul's failure to fully obey God's command serves as a warning about the consequences of partial obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's command reflects His justice and sovereignty, reminding us that His ways and thoughts are higher than ours.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context.htm">Historical Context</a></b><br>Understanding the historical enmity between Israel and Amalek provides insight into the gravity of God's command.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The Amalekites can be seen as a symbol of spiritual enemies that believers must confront and overcome through obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_15_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 15:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_15_3_God_s_judgment_on_Amalekites.htm">How does 1 Samuel 15:3 demonstrate God's judgment on the Amalekites' sin?

Amalek was to be looked upon as accursed; human beings and cattle must be killed; whatever was capable of being destroyed by fire must be burnt. The cup of iniquity in this people was filled up. Its national existence, if prolonged, would simply have worked mischief to the commonwealth of nations. Israel here was simply the instrument of destruction used by the Almighty. It is vain to attempt in this and similar transactions to find materials for the blame or the praise of Israel. We must never forget that Israel stood in a peculiar relation to the unseen King, and that this nation was not unfrequently used as the visible scourge by which the All-Wise punished hopelessly hardened sinners, and deprived them of the power of working mischief. We might as well find fault with pestilence and famine, or the sword--those awful instruments of Divine justice and--though we often fail to see it now--of Divine mercy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Utterly destroy.</span> Hebrew, "put under the ban." The word <span class="accented">herem</span>, ban, properly signifies a thing set apart, especially one devoted to God; and whatever was so devoted could not be redeemed, but must be slain. When a country was put under the ban, all living things, men and cattle, were to be killed; no spoil might be taken, but it was to be burnt, and things indestructible by fire, as silver and gold, were to be brought into the treasury. Everything, in short, belonging to such a nation was looked upon as accursed (see <a href="/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2, 3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and attack</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hik&#183;k&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
