This event occurs during a time when King Saul is desperate for guidance as the Philistines are preparing to attack Israel. Saul had previously expelled mediums and spiritists from the land in accordance with the Law (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>). The appearance of Samuel, who had died, is significant as it suggests a supernatural event permitted by God. This moment underscores the seriousness of Saul's disobedience and desperation. Theologically, it raises questions about the afterlife and God's sovereignty over life and death.<p><b>she cried out in a loud voice</b><br>The woman's reaction indicates surprise and fear, suggesting that she did not expect to actually see Samuel. This reaction implies that her usual practices may have been fraudulent or that she was not accustomed to such a genuine spiritual encounter. Her loud cry could also reflect the fear of divine judgment, as she realizes the gravity of the situation.<p><b>and said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you deceived me?</b><br>The woman's accusation of deception points to Saul's disguise when he visited her. Saul had hidden his identity because he had banned such practices in Israel. This deception highlights Saul's moral decline and his willingness to break his own laws in pursuit of guidance. It also reflects the broader theme of deception and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>You are Saul!&#8221;</b><br>The revelation of Saul's identity is pivotal. It marks a turning point where the woman recognizes the king, possibly through divine revelation or the appearance of Samuel. This moment emphasizes Saul's fall from grace and his isolation, as he can no longer rely on God or his people for support. It also foreshadows Saul's impending doom, as he has sought guidance from a source outside of God's will. This encounter serves as a warning against seeking forbidden spiritual practices and highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who sought guidance from God but received no answer.

God, who alone rules the unseen realm (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>), sovereignly permitted the genuine prophet to appear.<p>- The scene underscores that even the occult is under God&#8217;s authority. Much as Balaam could speak only what God allowed (<a href="/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>), so this medium&#8217;s encounter unfolded only by divine permission.<p>- Saul had sought a word apart from God&#8217;s approved means (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a>). Yet, in mercy mixed with judgment, the Lord let Samuel appear one last time to confront the king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She cried out in a loud voice</b><p>- Her shriek signals shock, not stagecraft. She expected familiar spirits she could manipulate, but the true prophet shattered her control. Similar fear erupts when people face holy realities: the disciples thought they&#8217;d seen a ghost and &#8220;cried out&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a>); the Gerasene demoniac &#8220;shouted in a loud voice&#8221; when Jesus arrived (<a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>).<p>- The outcry highlights the gulf between counterfeit spirituality and the genuine power of God. What she practiced daily suddenly felt terrifyingly real.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why have you deceived me?</b><p>- Moments earlier she had demanded Saul&#8217;s oath for protection (<a href="/1_samuel/28-9.htm">1 Samuel 28:9&#8211;10</a>). Now, realizing who her client is, she accuses him of deception.<p>- Ironically, Saul is the one long deceived&#8212;thinking he could bypass God&#8217;s silence by illicit means (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). His disguise (v. 8) typifies how sin tries to hide, yet God brings all to light (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>- The question exposes the futility of maneuvering around divine commands: deception breeds more fear and chaos (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are Saul!</b><p>- God unmasks Saul through the woman&#8217;s revelation. Like Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), the statement confronts him with personal accountability.<p>- Saul had once been recognized publicly as king by God&#8217;s prophet (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). Now he is exposed by an outlawed medium&#8212;a tragic reversal showing how far he has fallen.<p>- The moment anticipates the final judgment when every disguise fails and each person stands revealed (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-12.htm">1 Samuel 28:12</a> records a literal event in which God permits Samuel to appear, jolting both the medium and Saul. The woman&#8217;s shock, her accusation of deception, and the abrupt unveiling of Saul all spotlight God&#8217;s absolute authority, the emptiness of occult pursuits, and the inevitability of truth exposing sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice.</span>--Nothing is more clear from the narration than that the woman of En-dor saw <span class= "ital">something </span>she never dreamed of seeing. Whatever <span class= "ital">did </span>appear that night was different from anything she had seen before. Whether or not she was an impostor matters little to us. From the severe enactments in the Mosaic code respecting these practices, it would <span class= "ital">seem </span>as though in the background there was something dark and sinister. At all events, on this memorable occasion, the witch was evidently amazed and appalled at the success of her enchantments. Ewald supposes that she burst into a loud cry on seeing Samuel's shade, because it ascended with such frightfully threatening gestures, as it could have used only against its deadly enemy, Saul; and she then saw that the questioner must be Saul. This can, however, only be taken as an ingenious surmise. There is a singular passage in the <span class= "ital">Chaggigah </span>Treatise of the Babylonian Talmud (quoted below), which--contrary to the usual interpretation of the word rendered "gods" (<a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a>)--assumes that a second form "came up" with Samuel; and one Jewish interpretation tells us that these were "judges"--so rendering the <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>of <a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a>--judges robed in their judicial mantles; and it was the sight of these awful ministers of justice which appalled the consciously guilty woman. Deeply interesting, however, as are these traditions and comments, handed down probably from a school of exposi<span class= "bld">And the woman spake to Saul.</span>--At this juncture the woman recognised in the unknown stranger King Saul. For a moment remembering his stern, ruthless procedure in such cases of sorcery as the one in which she was then engaged, she thinks herself betrayed, and given over to a shameful death of agony; and she turns to the king boeide her with a piteous expostulation, "Why hast thou deceived me?" The question now comes up, How did she come to recognise Saul in the unknown? Ewald's ingenious suggestion has been mentioned above. Keil suggests that the woman had fallen into a state of clairvoyance, in which she recognised persons who, like Saul in his disguise, were unknown to her by face. Josephus (6:14, 2), no doubt writing from traditional sources, asserts that Samuel had most likely revealed the presence of Saul to the witch. "Samuel saw through Saul's disguise, which had deceived her whom Saul came to consult, as he spoke to Saul as Saul. So Ahijah the prophet, though blind by age, saw through the disguise of the wife of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-2.htm" title="And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray you, and disguise yourself, that you be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.">1Kings 14:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-6.htm" title="And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings.">1Kings 14:6</a>)."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p>On the whole, Josephus's explanation is probably the true one. It was some word--probably spoken by Samuel--not related here which betrayed the king's identity to the woman. There is one other possible supposition, but it, of course, belongs to the realms of fancy. We know it was night, and Saul was disguised; no doubt his face was partially covered. Is it not to be imagined that with the appearance of the blessed prophet, with or without a companion, a <span class= "ital">light </span>filled the dark room of the En-dor house? This would fall upon the king's face, who, in the agitation of the moment, would likely enough have thrown off the cape or mantle which shrouded his features. Something of the awful supernatural "light" Tennyson describes when he writes of the Holy Grail:--<p>" A gentle sound, an awful light! . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice.</span> Evidently the last thing that she had expected was that anything else should happen than the usual illusion by which she imposed upon her victims; nor is it certain that anything else did happen. Her assertion that she saw Samuel was probably false; and it was in feigned excitement that she cried out, <span class="cmt_word">Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</span> She could not but have noticed the tall stature, the dignified manner, and also the intense excitement of her strange visitor;
