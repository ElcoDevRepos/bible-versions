This period was usually dry, making rain highly unusual and potentially damaging to the crops. The mention of the wheat harvest sets the stage for a miraculous event, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. The harvest time was crucial for the agrarian society, and any disruption could lead to significant economic and food supply consequences. This context underscores the seriousness of the sign Samuel is about to invoke.<p><b>I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain,</b><br>Samuel's declaration to call upon the LORD for thunder and rain is significant because it demonstrates his role as a prophet and mediator between God and the people. Thunder and rain during the dry season would be seen as a divine intervention, highlighting God's power and authority. This act serves as a sign of God's displeasure with Israel's request for a king, contrasting with the typical weather patterns and showcasing God's control over nature. The event recalls other instances in Scripture where God uses weather as a sign, such as the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>) and Elijah's prayer for rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>).<p><b>so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed</b><br>The purpose of the miraculous sign is to convict the Israelites of their wrongdoing. By witnessing the unnatural storm, the people would recognize the seriousness of their sin in asking for a king. This phrase emphasizes the moral and spiritual implications of their request, framing it as a transgression against God's established order. The use of "know and see" suggests both intellectual and experiential understanding, indicating that the people would not only comprehend their sin but also feel its weight.<p><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the omniscience and omnipresence of God, who sees and judges the actions of His people. It underscores the idea that their request for a king was not just a political decision but a spiritual rebellion against God's kingship. The phrase serves as a reminder that all actions are ultimately accountable to God, who is the ultimate authority and judge. This concept is echoed throughout Scripture, where God is depicted as the one who sees the hearts and actions of individuals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p><b>by asking for a king.</b><br>The request for a king represented a significant shift in Israel's governance and spiritual life. It was seen as a rejection of God's direct rule over His people, as He had been their king since the time of the Exodus. The desire for a human king was influenced by the surrounding nations, reflecting a lack of faith in God's provision and protection. This request fulfilled the prophecy given in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, where God anticipated Israel's desire for a king and provided guidelines for such a ruler. The request also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King, who would fulfill God's promise of a righteous and eternal kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy.

Wheat harvest in Israel falls in late May or June, when the skies are normally clear and rain is virtually unheard of (<a href="/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/6-13.htm">1 Samuel 6:13</a>).<p>- By choosing this season, Samuel ensures that any sudden storm cannot be dismissed as coincidence. The timing underlines that God is about to act outside the expected natural order (<a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22&#8211;27</a>).<p>- The question also draws every Israelite into the scene: they have just brought in their crops, so they feel the cost of losing them to rain and hail (<a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain</b><p>- Samuel is not performing a trick; he is invoking the covenant God who controls the weather (<a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6-7</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;I will call on the LORD&#8221; points back to earlier leaders who prayed and saw immediate, public answers&#8212;Moses at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15-31</a>), Joshua at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>), Elijah on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>).<p>- Thunder and rain were often associated with divine authority and judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). God is about to underscore Samuel&#8217;s words with heaven&#8217;s signature.<p>- This miracle also reassures the faithful remnant that the Lord remains attentive despite the nation&#8217;s recent rebellion (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed in the sight of the LORD by asking for a king</b><p>- The purpose of the sign is conviction, not destruction. Israel&#8217;s demand for a king was not merely political; it was a rejection of God&#8217;s kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10-11</a>).<p>- &#8220;Great evil&#8221; highlights the seriousness of preferring human leadership over divine rule&#8212;echoing the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>- The visible storm turns an abstract sin into a felt reality. Like Nathan&#8217;s parable to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>), it confronts the conscience so repentance can follow (<a href="/1_samuel/12-19.htm">1 Samuel 12:19-25</a>).<p>- God still grants their request for a king, showing mercy within judgment, but He ensures they enter that new chapter aware of their need to remain obedient (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In the dry season of wheat harvest, Samuel calls for an impossible storm. God answers with thunder and rain, proving His sovereign power and exposing Israel&#8217;s sin of demanding a human king.

Rain in that season seldom or never falls, but if it does it is usually severe. This is the testimony of one who spoke as a resident, and his statement is confirmed by the observations of the latest travellers and scholars. The terrible storm of rain accompanied with thunder, at a time of year when these storms of thunder and rain rarely took place, coming, as it did, in direct answer to the seer's invocation, struck the people naturally with great fear, and for the moment they thoroughly repented of the past, and entreated Samuel--who, they felt, stood on strangely familiar terms with that awful yet loving Eternal--to intercede for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wheat harvest.</span> Barley was fit for reaping at the Passover, and wheat at Pentecost, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between the middle of May and the middle of June.
