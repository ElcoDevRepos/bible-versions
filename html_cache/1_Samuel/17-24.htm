Goliath, a giant from Gath, was a formidable warrior, standing over nine feet tall. His presence was intimidating, and he challenged the Israelites daily. The Israelites' reaction to Goliath highlights their lack of faith and reliance on God, contrasting with David's later response. This moment sets the stage for David's rise as a leader who trusts in God's power rather than human strength.<p><b>they fled from him</b><br>The Israelites' retreat signifies their fear and lack of confidence in their own abilities and in God's protection. This reaction is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites often struggle with faith and obedience. Their fear contrasts with the courage shown by figures like Joshua and Caleb, who trusted in God's promises despite overwhelming odds. The act of fleeing also underscores the need for a leader who can inspire faith and courage, which David ultimately provides.<p><b>in great fear</b><br>The fear experienced by the Israelites was not just physical but also spiritual, as they faced a seemingly insurmountable enemy. This fear reflects a broader theme in Scripture where God's people are called to trust in Him rather than succumb to fear. The Bible frequently addresses fear, encouraging believers to rely on God's strength and promises. In this context, the Israelites' fear foreshadows the need for a savior who can conquer fear and enemies, pointing to Jesus Christ, who overcomes the ultimate enemy, sin and death, through His sacrifice and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_israel.htm">The Men of Israel</a></b><br>These are the soldiers of Israel who were part of King Saul's army.
