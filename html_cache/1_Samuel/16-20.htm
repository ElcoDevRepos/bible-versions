Bread, a staple food in ancient Israel, symbolizes sustenance and life. This act reflects the cultural importance of offering gifts to those in authority, as seen in <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a> when Jacob sends gifts to Joseph. The donkey, a common beast of burden, indicates the practical means of transporting goods.<p><b>a skin of wine</b><br>Wine was a valued commodity in ancient Israel, often used in celebrations and religious rituals. The inclusion of wine signifies honor and goodwill. In biblical symbolism, wine can represent joy and blessing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>. The use of a skin, a traditional container, highlights the practical aspects of daily life in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and one young goat</b><br>The young goat, a valuable offering, signifies wealth and generosity. Goats were commonly used in sacrifices and feasts, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-24</a>. This gift underscores the importance of sacrificial offerings in maintaining relationships and showing respect, paralleling the sacrificial system that points to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>and sent them to Saul</b><br>Jesse's act of sending gifts to Saul, the king, reflects the cultural practice of showing allegiance and respect to rulers. This gesture is reminiscent of the tribute sent by Jacob to Esau in <a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-15</a>. It also foreshadows David's future relationship with Saul, marked by both service and conflict.<p><b>with his son David</b><br>David, the youngest son of Jesse, is introduced as a servant to Saul, setting the stage for his rise to prominence. This moment marks the beginning of David's journey from shepherd to king, a type of Christ who is both the Good Shepherd and the King of Kings. David's role as a servant to Saul prefigures Christ's humility and service, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-13.htm">Genesis 37:13-14</a>), a father dispatches a son into God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p>&#8226; The initiative highlights orderly submission to authority (<a
