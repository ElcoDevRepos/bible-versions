Keilah was a fortified city in the lowlands of Judah, significant for its strategic location. This phrase highlights the ongoing pursuit of David by Saul, who saw David as a threat to his throne. The context here is David's role as a fugitive, having been anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel, which created tension with Saul. The mention of Keilah connects to the broader narrative of David's reliance on God for guidance, as seen in his previous inquiries to God about his actions.<p><b>he said, &#8220;God has delivered him into my hand</b><br>Saul interprets David's presence in Keilah as divine intervention in his favor. This reflects Saul's belief that God was still supporting his kingship, despite his disobedience and rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). Saul's statement reveals his misunderstanding of God's will, contrasting with David's reliance on divine guidance. This phrase also foreshadows Saul's eventual downfall, as he misinterprets circumstances as divine approval.<p><b>for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.&#8221;</b><br>Keilah, being a fortified city, had gates and bars, which Saul saw as an opportunity to capture David. This reflects the military strategies of the time, where fortified cities were both a refuge and a potential trap. Saul's assumption that David was trapped shows his underestimation of David's resourcefulness and God's protection over David. This situation parallels other biblical narratives where God's chosen individuals are protected despite seemingly insurmountable odds, such as the Israelites' escape from Egypt. The phrase also highlights the theme of divine providence, as David's reliance on God ultimately leads to his escape from Saul's grasp.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly consumed by jealousy and paranoia over David, whom he sees as a threat to his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently on the run from Saul, seeking refuge and guidance from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/keilah.htm">Keilah</a></b><br>A fortified town in Judah, which David saves from the Philistines, but where he is later pursued by Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The perennial enemies of Israel, whose attack on Keilah prompts David to intervene.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_providence.htm">God's Providence</a></b><br>Saul mistakenly believes that God has delivered David into his hands, showcasing a misunderstanding of divine will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misinterpretation_of_god's_will.htm">Misinterpretation of God's Will</a></b><br>Saul's assumption that God has delivered David into his hands is a cautionary tale about presuming to know God's plans without seeking His guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god's_guidance.htm">The Importance of Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>David consistently seeks God's direction, contrasting with Saul's reliance on his own understanding.

The verse warns us that invoking God&#8217;s name does not guarantee God&#8217;s sanction; true deliverance belongs to those who seek Him, as David soon will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">God hath delivered him into mine hand.</span>--There was little chance, Saul knew, of his being able to capture or slay his foe when he was roaming at large through the desert and forests which lay to the south of Palestine, and which stretched far southward beyond the reach of any armed force that he could collect; but there was a hope of being able to compass his enemy's destruction, either through treachery or a hand-to-hand encounter, in a confined space like a city with bars and gates, such as Keilah. Saul and his counsellors knew too well whom they had to deal with in the case of the citizens of that faithless, thankless city. It is strange, after all that had passed, that Saul could delude himself that <span class= "ital">his </span>cause was the cause of God, and that David was the reprobate and rejected. The Hebrew word here is remarkable: God hath "repudiated or rejected him." The LXX. renders "sold him" (into my hands).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It was well nigh a hopeless matter to hunt David as long as he remained on the borders of the desert of Judah, but once shut up in a town his capture was inevitable. When Saul, therefore, heard that David was at Keilah, he said, <span class="cmt_word">God hath delivered him into my hand</span>. The Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate translate in the same way, probably as the nearest equivalent to the Hebrew, while the Septuagint has a different reading - <span class="accented">sold</span>. The Hebrew phrase is a very strong one; literally, "God hath ignored him," hath treated him as a stranger, and so let, him fall "into my hand." Possibly Saul s metaphor was taken from the popular language, and no attempt should be made to get rid of unusual expressions, as if they were false readings. <span class="cmt_word">By entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</span> Either the people of a walled town would give up David rather than expose themselves to the horrors of a siege (<a href="/2_samuel/20-21.htm">2 Samuel 20:21, 22</a>), or, if they stood by him, its capture would be a mere matter of time. David, it seems, would have run the risk, but happily was prevented. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When it was reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
