In the context of shepherding, a shepherd's responsibility was to protect the flock at all costs. David's willingness to pursue a predator reflects his dedication and bravery, qualities that foreshadow his future role as a leader of Israel. This action can be seen as a precursor to his pursuit of righteousness and justice as king.<p><b>struck it down</b><br>David's ability to strike down a predator demonstrates his skill and strength, even as a young shepherd. This act of striking down a threat is symbolic of God's empowerment of His chosen leaders to overcome obstacles. It also prefigures David's later victory over Goliath, where he again strikes down a formidable enemy, showing that God equips those He calls.<p><b>and delivered the lamb from its mouth</b><br>The act of delivering the lamb signifies salvation and rescue, themes central to the biblical narrative. David's role as a deliverer of the lamb mirrors God's role as the Deliverer of Israel. This imagery is also a type of Christ, the Good Shepherd, who delivers His people from sin and death, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>.<p><b>If it reared up against me</b><br>This phrase indicates the potential danger and aggression of the predator. David's readiness to confront such danger reflects his faith and reliance on God's protection. It also illustrates the spiritual battles believers face, where they must stand firm against the adversary, as encouraged in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>I would grab it by its fur</b><br>Grabbing the predator by its fur shows David's hands-on approach and personal involvement in protecting his flock. This action signifies the intimate and personal care God has for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd who gathers the lambs in His arms.<p><b>strike it down</b><br>The repetition of striking down emphasizes the decisive action required to eliminate threats. It underscores the theme of divine justice and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. This mirrors the eschatological hope found in Revelation, where Christ will ultimately defeat all evil.<p><b>and kill it</b><br>The finality of killing the predator signifies complete victory and the removal of the threat. This act of killing can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death through His crucifixion and resurrection. It also points to the ultimate defeat of Satan, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd who would later become the king of Israel.
