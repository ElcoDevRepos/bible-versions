In the cultural context of ancient Israel, childlessness was often seen as a source of shame and a sign of divine disfavor. Her continuous prayer indicates her belief in God's power to change her situation. This persistence in prayer is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the importance of persistent prayer in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>. Hannah's prayer life is a model of faithfulness and trust in God's timing and sovereignty.<p><b>Eli watched her mouth</b><br>Eli, the high priest, observed Hannah's silent prayer, which was unusual for the time, as prayers were typically spoken aloud. This silent prayer can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament understanding of prayer as a personal and intimate communication with God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>. Eli's role as a priest is significant, as he represents the religious authority of the time, yet his initial misunderstanding of Hannah's actions highlights the spiritual decline in Israel, which is a recurring theme in the book of 1 Samuel. Eli's observation also sets the stage for his later interaction with Hannah, where he blesses her, leading to the fulfillment of her prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman of faith, deeply distressed due to her barrenness, who fervently prays to the LORD for a child.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest at Shiloh, who observes Hannah as she prays silently and initially misunderstands her actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The religious center where the tabernacle was located during this period, and where Hannah goes to pray.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom Hannah directs her prayers, demonstrating her faith and reliance on Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, which is central to this passage as Hannah pours out her heart before the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistent_prayer.htm">The Power of Persistent Prayer</a></b><br>Hannah's continuous prayer before the LORD demonstrates the importance of persistence in our prayer life.

Verse 10 already said she was &#8220;deeply distressed&#8221; and &#8220;wept bitterly,&#8221; and now we find her still at it&#8212;she &#8220;kept on.&#8221; The scene echoes Jesus&#8217; call to &#8220;always pray and not lose heart&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>) and Paul&#8217;s command to &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Her perseverance springs from genuine faith. She is barren, yet she approaches the One who &#8220;opens and closes the womb&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>). The Bible repeatedly commends such steadfast crying out&#8212;think of David in <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>, &#8220;Evening, morning, and noon I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This tenacity underlines that God invites long, honest wrestling. Hannah&#8217;s example assures believers today that length or intensity of prayer never annoys the Lord; instead, He cherishes it (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Hannah&#8217;s praying is consciously placed &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; reminding us she is not merely speaking into the air. She stands in the tabernacle at Shiloh, the appointed meeting place (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-43</a>). For a New-Covenant believer, this points us to the privilege of coming &#8220;boldly to the throne of grace&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores reverence. Hannah recognizes God&#8217;s holy presence, much like Isaiah who cried, &#8220;My eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). Her posture&#8212;likely kneeling or bowing&#8212;mirrors <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>, &#8220;Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By praying &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; she is placing her entire situation under His sovereign gaze. The same awareness steadied Job: &#8220;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him&#8221; (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eli watched her mouth</b><p>&#8226; While Hannah pours out her heart to God, the high priest fixes his attention on her lips. Verse 13 clarifies, &#8220;Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice was not heard.&#8221; Eli&#8217;s surveillance highlights a contrast: man looks outside; the LORD reads the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s observation prepares the narrative tension. His initial misjudgment (v.14) shows how even spiritual leaders can misunderstand sincere devotion. Yet God will soon vindicate Hannah, just as He later vindicates Mary of Bethany when others criticize her worship (<a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment also affirms that silent, internal prayer is fully valid. Nehemiah prayed &#8220;in his heart&#8221; before answering the king (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4</a>). God hears wordless groans (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/1-12.htm">1 Samuel 1:12</a> portrays persevering, reverent prayer offered directly in God&#8217;s presence while human eyes observe only externals. Hannah&#8217;s persistence encourages believers to keep praying; her setting &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; reminds us of holy access; and Eli&#8217;s scrutiny warns that people may misread genuine faith, but God never does. The verse invites every follower of Christ to approach the throne with unwavering, heartfelt prayer, confident that the Lord who sees in secret will respond in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She continued praying.</span> Hannah's prayer was long and earnest, but in silence. She spake not in, but "to her heart," to herself. It was an inward supplication, which only her own heart and God heard. Eli watched, and was displeased. Possibly silent prayer was something unusual. It requires a certain advance in civilisation and refinement to enable a supplicant to separate the petition from the outward expression of it in spoken words, and a strong faith before any one can feel that God hears and knows the silent utterances of the heart (comp. <a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8-10</a>). Naturally men think that they shall be heard for their much speaking, and for speaking aloud. Unused then to such real prayer, Eli, as he marked the quivering lips, the prostrate form, the face flushed with earnestness, came to the coarse conclusion that she was drunken, and with equal coarseness bids her "put away her wine from her," that is, go and sleep off the effects of her debauch. Hannah answers indignantly, "No, my lord." She is "a woman hard of spirit;' (see marg.), heavy hearted, as we should say, and she had been lightening her heart by pouring out her troubles before Jehovah. She is no "worthless woman;" for Belial is not a proper name, though gradually it became one (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>), but means <span class="accented">worthlessness</span>, and "a daughter of worthlessness" means a bad woman. <span class="accented">"Grief"</span> is rather <span class="accented">provocation, vexation.</span> Hannah cannot forget the triumph of her rival, exulting over her many portions, while for her there had been only one. Convinced by the modesty and earnestness of her answer, Eli retracts his accusation, gives her his blessing, and prays that her petition may be granted. And Hannah, comforted by such words spoken by the high priest (<a href="/john/11-51.htm">John 11:51</a>), returned to the sacrificial feast, which apparently was not yet finished, and joined in it, for "she did eat, and her countenance was to her no more," that is, the grieved and depressed look which she had so long borne had now departed from her. There is no reason for the insertion of the word <span class="accented">sad.</span> HANNAH'S PRAYER ANSWERED (vers. 19, 20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Hannah] kept on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">praying</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;pal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
