In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women often accompanied their families to religious festivals, but Hannah's choice underscores her focus on the spiritual commitment she made. Her absence from the pilgrimage is a deliberate act of preparation for the fulfillment of her promise to dedicate her son to the Lord.<p><b>&#8220;After the boy is weaned,&#8221;</b><br>Weaning in ancient Israel typically occurred around the age of three, marking a significant milestone in a child's early life. This period allowed Hannah to bond with Samuel and prepare him for his future service. The weaning process was not only physical but also spiritual, as Hannah likely used this time to instill in Samuel a sense of his divine purpose. This phrase also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where weaning was celebrated as a transition from infancy to early childhood.<p><b>she said to her husband,</b><br>Hannah's communication with Elkanah demonstrates the mutual respect and understanding within their marriage. In a patriarchal society, her ability to express her intentions and have them respected by her husband indicates a partnership rooted in faith and shared spiritual goals. This dialogue also reflects the importance of family unity in fulfilling religious vows.<p><b>&#8220;I will take him to appear before the LORD</b><br>Hannah's vow to bring Samuel to appear before the Lord at Shiloh signifies her commitment to dedicating her son to God's service. Shiloh was the central place of worship at the time, housing the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant. This act of dedication is reminiscent of the Nazarite vow, where individuals were set apart for God's purposes. Hannah's promise aligns with the biblical theme of offering one's best to God, as seen in the stories of other dedicated servants like Samson and John the Baptist.<p><b>and to stay there permanently.&#8221;</b><br>Hannah's intention for Samuel to remain at the Tabernacle permanently underscores the depth of her commitment and faith. This lifelong dedication is a profound act of worship and trust in God's plan for Samuel. It also foreshadows Samuel's significant role as a prophet and leader in Israel, serving as a type of Christ in his role as a mediator between God and the people. Hannah's sacrifice parallels the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who was dedicated to God's service from birth and remained faithful to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman of faith, Hannah is the mother of Samuel.

From <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-27.htm" title="But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.">2 Maccabees 7:27</a>, it appears that Hebrew mothers were in the habit of suckling their children for three years. The mother proposed, when the weaning had taken place, to leave her son as a servant of the sanctuary, there to remain all his life.<p>On the late period of weaning among the Oriental nations, Kalisch refers to the Persian custom of suckling boys two years and two months, and girls two years.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but Hannah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;an&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
