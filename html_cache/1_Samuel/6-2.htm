The Philistines, a seafaring people known for their conflicts with Israel, relied on these figures to interpret the will of their gods. This reflects a common practice of seeking supernatural insight during times of crisis. The Philistines had captured the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred object representing the presence of the God of Israel, and were experiencing calamities as a result. This consultation indicates their recognition of the ark's power and their desperation to appease the God of Israel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the LORD?</b><br>The Philistines' question reveals their acknowledgment of the ark's significance and their fear of the consequences of keeping it. The ark, central to Israelite worship, contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments and symbolized God's covenant with Israel. The Philistines' troubles, including plagues and the destruction of their idol Dagon, led them to seek a solution. This question underscores the tension between the Philistines' pagan practices and the power of the God of Israel, highlighting the ark's role as a divine instrument.<p><b>Tell us how to send it back to its place.&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines' desire to return the ark to its rightful place reflects their understanding that the ark belonged to the Israelites and their God. This request for guidance on how to return it safely indicates their fear of further divine retribution. The phrase "its place" refers to the ark's intended location among the Israelites, specifically in the tabernacle. This action foreshadows the eventual return of the ark to Israel and the restoration of proper worship. It also illustrates the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were often in conflict with the Israelites.

Cross-reference: <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12&#8211;13</a> shows how God&#8217;s judgments on Egypt humbled a pagan nation in similar fashion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summoned the priests and diviners</b><p>&#8226; Pagans naturally turned to their own spiritual specialists.

After experiencing God&#8217;s heavy hand, the Philistines acknowledged, &#8220;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/5-7.htm">1 Samuel 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inquiry parallels Pharaoh&#8217;s plea during the plagues, &#8220;Entreat the LORD&#8230; that He may take away this death&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/10-17.htm">Exodus 10:17</a>). When divine judgment falls, the heart instinctively seeks relief.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;ark of the LORD&#8221; reminds us the ark is no magical box; it is the earthly footstool of the living God (<a href="/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, Israel at Shiloh had treated the ark as a lucky charm (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>), yet the Philistines now recognize its true Owner and power.<p>&#8226; Cross-reference: <a href="/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9</a> records David&#8217;s similar question, &#8220;How can the ark of the LORD come to me?&#8221;&#8212;showing that reverent fear is the right response, whether in Philistia or in Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Tell us how to send it back to its place.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Their goal is restitution, not negotiation. They want the ark &#8220;back to its place,&#8221; acknowledging God has rightful territory among His people (<a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33&#8211;36</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests will advise a guilt offering of golden tumors and rats (<a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4&#8211;5</a>), confessing the exact plagues God sent&#8212;an Old Testament picture of admitting specific sin.<p>&#8226; They will set the ark on a new cart pulled by two milk cows never yoked before, sending them off without drivers (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7&#8211;9</a>). If the cows head straight to Israel, it will confirm the disaster was from God, not coincidence.<p>&#8226; That plan mirrors the principle of testing laid fleece-style, yet always with the intent to obey once God&#8217;s will is clear (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; The Philistines thus join a long list of unwilling witnesses who end up proclaiming God&#8217;s glory&#8212;like the sailors with Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-14.htm">Jonah 1:14&#8211;16</a>) and Pilate&#8217;s inscription over Jesus (<a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-2.htm">1 Samuel 6:2</a> captures a pagan nation at the end of its rope, recognizing that the God who owns the ark also controls history. By summoning their spiritual advisors, asking how to return the ark, and planning to send it &#8220;back to its place,&#8221; the Philistines confess three truths: God&#8217;s power is real, His holiness is dangerous when mocked, and the only safe response is surrender to His rightful rule. In witnessing their fear-driven obedience, we are reminded that God can use even unbelievers to honor His name and return His glory to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">What shall we do to the ark of the Lord?</span>--During the seven months which followed the great Philistine victory of Aphek, the Ark remained in the country of the enemies of Israel. It was removed from temple to temple in the various cities, but the same doom always followed it. The inhabitants of the city where was the Ark were smitten with deadly abscesses, in addition to which, from the statement in <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm" title="Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.">1Samuel 6:5</a>, a plague of field-mice during the same period probably desolated the land. In their distress the Philistine rulers, determining to get rid of the fatal trophy of which they were once so proud, consulted their priests and diviners as to the most graceful and effective way of returning the captured Hebrew emblem. The "diviners" in the counsels of all the nations of antiquity occupy a distinguished place. We hear of them under different designations, as magicians, sorcerers, soothsayers, augurs, oracles, &c. They plied their strange trade, now with the aid of arrows, now with the entrails of slain animals, now with observation of the stars, now with the watching of natural signs, the flight of birds, &c. These men, who in one form or other dabbled in occult science, and perhaps here and there were aided by evil and unclean spirits, but who more frequently traded on the credulity and superstition of their fellows, occupied a considerable position among the nations of antiquity. We hear of them frequently among the Israelites, who seem to have adopted this class of advisers from the heathen nations around them. Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm" title="The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,">Isaiah 3:2</a>) specially mentions them, and reckons these diviners among the leading orders of the State. The English Version, however, with singular inconsistency, renders the word in that same passage by "prudent;" possibly, it has been ingeniously suggested, owing to the translators being displeased at finding the professors of a forbidden art ranked so highly among the chosen people.<p>In the first verse the LXX. add, "and the land swarmed with mice," another of the many explanatory additions so common in the Greek translation of the Hebrew.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">summoned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
