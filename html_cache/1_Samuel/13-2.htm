Prior to this, Israel relied on ad hoc militias. The choice of three thousand men suggests a strategic move to maintain a ready force for defense and offense against the Philistines, who were a constant threat. This action reflects Saul's role as king and military leader, emphasizing the transition from a tribal confederation to a centralized monarchy.<p><b>Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel:</b><br>Michmash and Bethel are strategically located in the central highlands of Israel, providing a tactical advantage for defense and control over the surrounding regions. Michmash, in particular, is noted for its narrow pass, which would later play a crucial role in Jonathan's victory over the Philistines (1 Samuel 14). The hill country of Bethel is historically significant as a place of worship and a site associated with the patriarchs, adding a layer of spiritual importance to Saul's military positioning.<p><b>and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:</b><br>Jonathan, Saul's son, is introduced as a military leader, foreshadowing his future exploits and his close relationship with David. Gibeah, Saul's hometown, serves as a base of operations and reflects the tribal heritage of the Benjamites. This allocation of troops highlights Jonathan's emerging role and the trust Saul places in him. Gibeah's location in Benjamin also underscores the tribal dynamics at play within the newly established monarchy.<p><b>And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home:</b><br>This decision to send the remaining troops home suggests a reliance on a reserve force that could be called upon when needed, a common practice in ancient warfare. It reflects the economic and social realities of the time, where men were needed to tend to their fields and families. This approach also indicates Saul's confidence in the smaller, professional army he retained, while maintaining the ability to mobilize a larger force if necessary. This practice of sending troops home is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the story of Gideon (Judges 7), where God reduces the number of soldiers to demonstrate His power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

The verse reveals strategic insight, introduces Jonathan&#8217;s leadership, and underscores that victory will hinge not on numbers but on faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel.</span>--This is a very important statement, as it tells us of the first beginning of a standing army in Israel. This was the first step towards the development of Israel into a great military power. It was Saul's military genius and foresight which enabled David and Solomon to make those great conquests which raised Israel for a time to the position of one of the greatest Eastern Powers. The really great life of Saul was frittered away in repelling what may be termed Israel's domestic enemies. such as the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites; but he left behind him a powerful and disciplined army, and a nation carefully trained to war. It has been asked, how was it, considering the position of Israel and the Philistines at that juncture--the latter people possessing evidently not a few strong places in the territories of the tribes, from whence they were in the habit of sallying forth, and harassing and pillaging the people--that Saul, instead of at once declaring war, dismissed the people gathered at Gilgal, only retaining so few? The probability is that Saul, with true military instinct, saw that Israel was at this period by no means trained or armed to undertake a regular war with such an enemy. He therefore adopted the wise course here related.<p><span class= "bld">Whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash.</span>--Michmash was a position strongly situated at the head of a pass some nine miles north-east of Jerusalem. The "one thousand" he placed under the command of his son Jonathan, and stationed them in the neighbourhood of his old home, where he would have the benefit of the aid of his family and kinsfolk. This is the first mention of the gallant and chivalrous prince, the story of whose unbroken and romantic friendship with David is one of the most touching episodes of these books. "If the substance of this narrative was written in David's reign, we may perhaps see the effect of David's generous and loving nature in the care taken to give Jonathan his due place of honour in the history."--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul chose him.</span> Literally, "And Saul chose him," the usual way of commencing the narrative of a king's reign. He probably selected these 3000 men at the end of the war with the Ammonites, to strengthen the small bodyguard which he had gathered round him at Gibeah (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). As being always in arms, they would become highly disciplined, and form the nucleus and centre of all future military operations (see on 1 Samuel 14:52). He stationed these on either side of the defile in the mountain range of Bethel, so exactly described in <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, where Sennacherib, as we read, leaves his carriage, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his baggage, at Michmash, and after defiling through the pass, arrives at Geba. Gibeah, where Jonathan was posted with 1000 of these picked warriors, was Saul's home, and his son would have the benefit there of the aid of Kish and Abner, while Michmash was the more exposed place, situate about seven miles northeast of Jerusalem. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:110) describes this defile as "a narrow gorge with vertical precipices some 800 feet high - a great crack or fissure in the country, which is peculiar in this respect, that you only become aware of its existence when close to the brink; for on the north the narrow spur of hills hides it, and on the south a flat plateau extends to the top of the crags. On the south side of this great chasm stands Geba of Benjamin, on a rocky knoll, with caverns beneath the houses, and arable land to the east; and on the opposite side, considerably lower than Geba, is the little village of Michmash, on a sort of saddle, backed by an open and fertile corn valley. This valley was famous for producing excellent barley. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tent.</span> This with us would be a warlike phrase; but as the mass of the Israelites then dwelt in tents, it means simply their dispersion homewards; and so the Syriac translates, "He dismissed them each to his house" (see <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He chose</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
