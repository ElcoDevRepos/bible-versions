In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>, David spares King Saul's life in the cave at En Gedi. This event is significant as it demonstrates David's integrity and respect for God's anointed king, despite Saul's pursuit to kill him. The phrase underscores the importance of public testimony and the power of actions to reveal character.<p><b>how you have treated me well</b><br>David's treatment of Saul is a profound example of mercy and grace. Despite having the opportunity to kill Saul, David chooses to spare him, illustrating the biblical principle of loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). This act of kindness is a reflection of David's heart after God, as he respects the divine appointment of Saul as king.<p><b>for when the LORD delivered me into your hand</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty in the situation. David recognizes that it was by God's providence that Saul was placed in a vulnerable position. This phrase reflects the biblical theme of God's control over human affairs and His ability to orchestrate events according to His will (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><b>you did not kill me</b><br>David's decision not to kill Saul is a testament to his faith and obedience to God. It also serves as a foreshadowing of Christ's teaching on forgiveness and mercy. David's restraint is a type of Christ, who also showed mercy to those who sought His life. This act of sparing Saul's life is a powerful example of the biblical principle of leaving vengeance to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is being pursued by King Saul.

This reflects God's character and commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>David's restraint shows his trust in God's justice and timing.

This teaches us to honor and respect authority, even when it is difficult.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_forgiveness.htm">The Power of Forgiveness</a></b><br>By forgiving Saul, David breaks the cycle of violence and sets an example of peace. Forgiveness can transform relationships and bring healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>David's experience in the cave is a reminder that God is sovereign over our circumstances.

When Jesus says, &#8220;Let your light shine before men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>), He is affirming the same principle: godly behavior testifies to the heart.<p>&#8226; Believers are called to let deeds confirm faith, just as David&#8217;s restraint confirmed his respect for God&#8217;s plans (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how you have treated me well</b><p>&#8226; The king who has hunted David must admit, &#8220;how you have treated me well.&#8221; Genuine goodness disarms hostility (<a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>; <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>).<p>&#8226; David repays evil with kindness, modeling the ethic later taught by Jesus: &#8220;Love your enemies&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Treating an enemy well reflects trust that God will vindicate His servant in His time (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for when the LORD delivered me into your hand</b><p>&#8226; Saul sees God&#8217;s hand behind the encounter in the cave: &#8220;the LORD delivered me.&#8221; Nothing happens by chance (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God sometimes tests His people by placing power over others in their grasp. Joseph recognized a similar test in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; David passes the test because he places God&#8217;s sovereignty above personal opportunity, echoing &#8220;Do not touch My anointed ones&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>, referring here to Saul&#8217;s royal anointing).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you did not kill me</b><p>&#8226; The restraint is astonishing: David spares the very life that threatens him. Later he repeats the same mercy at Hakilah Hill (<a href="/1_samuel/26-8.htm">1 Samuel 26:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing not to kill when culture might applaud vengeance reflects the command, &#8220;Do not repay evil with evil&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By sparing Saul, David leaves justice to God (<a href="/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12</a>) and illustrates the New Testament call to entrust ourselves to the One who judges justly (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>1 Sam 24:18 shows Saul admitting that David&#8217;s mercy reveals a godly heart. David treats his enemy well, recognizing God&#8217;s sovereignty in delivering Saul into his hand, yet refusing to seize judgment for himself. The verse teaches us that authentic faith expresses itself through visible acts of grace, trust in God&#8217;s timing, and refusal to retaliate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
