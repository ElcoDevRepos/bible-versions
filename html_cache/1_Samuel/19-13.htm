This indicates that despite Israel's monotheistic faith, syncretism with surrounding pagan practices was prevalent. The presence of such an idol in David's house suggests the cultural and religious challenges faced by the Israelites. The use of the idol here is ironic, as David, a man after God's own heart, is associated with an object contrary to God's commandments.<p><b>and laid it in the bed</b><br>Michal's action of placing the idol in the bed is a strategic move to deceive Saul's messengers. This act of deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where women use cunning to protect God's chosen, such as Rahab hiding the spies (<a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4-6</a>). It highlights the theme of divine providence working through human actions to protect David, who is anointed to be king.<p><b>placed some goat hair on its head</b><br>The use of goat hair to mimic David's hair is a clever ruse to make the idol appear more lifelike. Goat hair was commonly used in the ancient world for various purposes, including clothing and tents, due to its availability and durability. This detail underscores Michal's resourcefulness and the lengths she goes to protect David, reflecting the tension and danger of the situation.<p><b>and covered it with a garment</b><br>Covering the idol with a garment completes the illusion of a sleeping person, buying David time to escape. Garments in biblical times were significant, often indicating status or identity. Here, the garment serves a practical purpose in the deception. This act of covering also symbolically represents the concealment of truth, as Michal hides the reality of David's absence from Saul's men. This narrative foreshadows the protective covering God provides for His chosen ones, as seen in the broader biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>The daughter of King Saul and wife of David.

Such images, though forbidden (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), still lingered in some Israelite households (<a href="/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>), showing how easily compromise can creep in.<p>&#8226; Michal&#8217;s quick reach for the idol reveals her urgency. Saul&#8217;s murderous intent (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>) demanded immediate action, and the closest sizable form at hand was this statute.<p>&#8226; The scene highlights a tension: a wife loyal to her husband versus a king (and father) bent on sin.

Quick, simple touches make the ruse believable, echoing other moments of disguise in David&#8217;s life (<a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that God often uses ordinary means&#8212;here, household items and a wife&#8217;s creativity&#8212;to accomplish extraordinary protection (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and covered it with a garment</b><p>&#8226; A cloak completes the charade, hiding obvious imperfections.

The verse exposes lingering idolatry in Israelite homes while showcasing God&#8217;s providence through imperfect people and ordinary objects. Above all, it affirms that the Lord sovereignly guards His chosen servant, maneuvering through the courage and creativity of those who stand with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">An image.</span>--An image in the Hebrew is <span class= "ital">teraphim--</span>a plural form, but used as a singular. We have no instance of the singular. The Latin equivalent, "penates," singularly enough, is also only found in the plural form. In this case, probably, it was a life-size figure or bust. The word has been discussed above (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>). It is singular how, in spite of the stern command to avoid idolatry, the children of Israel seemed to love to possess these lifeless images. The teraphim were probably a remnant of the idolatry originally brought by some of Abraham's family from their Chaldaean home. These idols, we know, varied in size, from the diminutive image which Rachel (<a href="/genesis/31-34.htm" title="Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.">Genesis 31:34</a>) was able to conceal under the camel saddle to the life-size figure which the Princess Michal here used to make her father's guards believe that her sick husband, David, was in bed. They appear to have been looked on as tutelary deities, the dispensers of domestic and family good fortune. It has been suggested, with some probability, that Michal, like Rachel, kept this teraphim in secret, because of her barrenness.<p><span class= "bld">A pillow of goats' hair.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">a goat's skin about its head. </span>So render the Syriac and Vulgate Versions. The reason of this act apparently was to imitate the effect of a man's hair round the teraphim's head. Its body, we read in the next clause, was covered "with a cloth." Some scholars have suggested that this goat's skin was a net-work of goat's hair to keep off the flies from the supposed sleeper. The LXX., instead of <span class= "ital">k'vir </span>(skin), read in their Hebrew copies <span class= "ital">keaved </span>(liver). As the vowel points were introduced much later, such a confusion (especially as the difference between <span class= "ital">d </span>and <span class= "ital">r </span>in Hebrew is very slight) would be likely enough to occur in the MSS.<p>Josephus, adopting the LXX. reading, explains Michal's conduct thus--"Michal put a palpitating goat's liver into the bed, to represent a breathing sick man."<p><span class= "bld">With a cloth.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">beged. </span>This was David's every-day garment, which he was in the habit of wearing. This, loosely thrown over the image, would materially assist the deception. The fifty-ninth Psalm bears the following title--"A michtam(or song of deep import) of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him." The internal evidence, however, is scarcely confirmatory of the accuracy of the title. The sacred song in question is very probably one of David's own composition, and it is likely enough that the danger he incurred on this occasion was in his mind when he wrote the solemn words; but there are references in this psalm which must apply to other events in his troubled, anxious life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michal took an image.</span> Literally, "the teraphim," a plural word, but used here as a singular. Probably, like the corresponding Latin word <span class="accented">penates</span>, it had no singular in common use. It was a wooden block with head and shoulders roughly shaped to represent a human figure. Laban's tera-phim were so small that Rachel could hide them under the camel's furniture (<a href="/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>), but Michal's seems to have been large enough to pass in the bed for a man. Though the worship of them is described as iniquity (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>), yet the superstitious belief that they brought good luck to the house over which they presided, in return for kind treatment, seems to have been proof against the teaching of the prophets; and Hosea describes the absence of them as on the same level as the absence of the ephod (<a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</span> More correctly, "a goat's skin about its head." So the Syriac and Vulgate. The object of it, would be to look at a distance like a man s hair. The Septuagint has a goat's liver, because this was supposed to palpitate long after the animal's death, and so would produce the appearance of a person's breathing. But this involves a different reading, for which there is no authority; nor was Michal's deception intended for close observation. She would of course not let any one disturb David, and all she wanted was just enough likeness to a man to make a person at a distance suppose that David was there. Soon or later her artifice would be found out, but her husband would have had the intervening time for effecting his escape. As the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">pillow</span>, and which is found only here, comes from a root signifying "to knot together," "to intertwine," some commentators think that it means a network of goats' hair, perhaps to keep off flies. But this is a mere guess, and not to be set against the combined authority of the two versions. <span class="cmt_word">With a cloth.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">beged.</span> This <span class="accented">beged</span> was David's every day dress, and would greatly aid Michal in her pious artifice. It was a loose mantle, worn over the close-fitting <span class="accented">meil</span> (see <a href="/1_samuel/2-19.htm">1 Samuel 2:19</a>). Thus Ezra (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 5</a>) says, "I rent my <span class="accented">beged</span> and my <span class="accented">meil</span>," which the A.V. with characteristic inexactness translates "my garment and my mantle."
