Blessings from a priest were seen as invoking God's favor and were highly valued. Elkanah and his wife, Hannah, were devout worshippers, regularly visiting Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located. This setting underscores the importance of religious observance and the priestly role in Israelite society.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD give you children by this woman</b><br>Hannah had previously been barren, which was a source of great distress and social stigma in ancient Israel. Her dedication of Samuel to the LORD was a profound act of faith and sacrifice. Eli's blessing reflects a hope for divine intervention, emphasizing God's sovereignty over life and fertility. This phrase also highlights the cultural importance of lineage and inheritance in Israelite society.<p><b>in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Hannah's dedication of Samuel was a fulfillment of her vow to God, demonstrating her deep faith and commitment. This act of dedication is reminiscent of other biblical figures who were set apart for God's service, such as Samson and John the Baptist. The concept of dedicating a child to the LORD foreshadows the ultimate dedication seen in Jesus Christ, who was consecrated for God's redemptive plan.<p><b>Then they would go home.</b><br>This phrase indicates the conclusion of their pilgrimage to Shiloh, a journey undertaken annually by Elkanah's family. It reflects the rhythm of worship and daily life in ancient Israel, where religious observance was interwoven with family and community life.

And the Lord visited Hannah.</span>--The blessing of Eli, a blessing which soon bore its fruit in the house of the pious couple,--his training of Samuel, and unswerving kindness to the boy (see following chapter),--his sorrow at his priestly sons' wickedness,--his passionate love for his country, all indicate that the influence of the weak but loving high priest was ever exerted to keep the faith of the people pure, and the life of Israel white before the Lord. There were evidently two parties at Shiloh, the head-quarters of the national religion: the reckless, unbelieving section, headed by Hophni and Phinehas; and the God-fearing, law-loving partisans of the old Divine law, under the influence of the weak, but religious, Eli. These latter kept the lamp of the loved faith burning--though but dimly--among the covenant people until the days when the strong hand of Samuel took the helm of government in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord give thee seed,</span> etc. The manner in which Eli blesses Elkanah shows that this surrender of a very young child to religious service was not looked upon as imposing a burden upon the sanctuary, but as the bestowal of a valued gift. <span class="accented">Loan</span> and <span class="accented">lent</span> by no means give the whole sense, which is in fact beyond the power of our language to express; for the Hebrew is remarkable for its manner of saying a great deal in a few words, by using them indefinitely.
