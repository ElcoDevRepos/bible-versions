The presence of the LORD with David signifies divine favor and protection, a theme recurrent throughout David's life. This echoes earlier biblical accounts where God's presence with individuals like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) led to their success and leadership. Saul's awareness of God's favor upon David contrasts with his own experience, as the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>). This realization likely intensified Saul's jealousy and fear, as he understood that David was chosen by God, potentially as his successor. Theologically, this highlights the sovereignty of God in choosing leaders and the importance of divine presence for legitimate leadership.<p><b>and that his daughter Michal loved David</b><br>Michal's love for David introduces a personal and familial dimension to the unfolding drama. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriages often involved political alliances and familial strategies. Michal's affection for David, however, appears genuine and personal, adding complexity to Saul's relationship with David. This love is significant as it later plays a role in David's escape from Saul's attempts on his life (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11-17</a>). Michal's love for David can be seen as a divine provision for David's protection, aligning with God's overarching plan for David's rise to kingship. Additionally, Michal's love for David contrasts with Saul's growing animosity, highlighting the division within Saul's own household. This division foreshadows the eventual transfer of loyalty from Saul to David among the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who becomes increasingly jealous and fearful of David's success and favor with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness and courage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Saul's daughter, who loves David and becomes his wife, playing a significant role in the unfolding drama between Saul and David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose presence and favor are evident in David's life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Saul reigns and David is destined to lead, serving as the backdrop for the unfolding events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_the_lord.htm">The Presence of the LORD</a></b><br>Recognize that the LORD's presence in our lives is a source of strength and favor.

Now he consciously acknowledges the divine favor resting on David.<p>&#8226; Recognition does not lead Saul to repentance; instead it hardens his heart, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, &#8220;A man who remains stiff-necked after much rebuke will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD was with David</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).

Instead of spurring Saul to humble obedience, this realization deepens his hostility.
