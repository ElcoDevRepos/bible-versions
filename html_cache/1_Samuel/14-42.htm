This moment occurs during a time of military tension with the Philistines, highlighting Saul's struggle to maintain control and authority. His decision to cast lots reflects a common ancient practice for decision-making, seen in other biblical instances such as <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a> and <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.&#8221;</b><br>Casting lots was a method used to discern God's will, often involving stones or sticks. It was believed that God controlled the outcome, making it a way to seek divine guidance. Saul's choice to include himself and Jonathan in the casting of lots shows his desperation to identify the cause of God's silence, as earlier in the chapter, Saul had made a rash oath that led to the people sinning unknowingly. This reflects the tension between Saul and Jonathan, as Jonathan had unknowingly violated Saul's oath by eating honey (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>).<p><b>And Jonathan was selected.</b><br>Jonathan, Saul's son, is chosen by the lot, revealing the divine intervention in the process. This selection underscores Jonathan's role as a man of faith and courage, contrasting with Saul's often impulsive and fearful leadership. Jonathan's earlier actions, where he trusted God for victory over the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>), highlight his reliance on God rather than human methods. This moment foreshadows the eventual decline of Saul's kingship and the rise of David, as Jonathan's faithfulness and integrity are qualities that align with God's choice of leadership, seen later in David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

By stepping forward to speak, he assumes the role of judge, much like he did when lots were cast earlier to identify him as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-22</a>). The moment echoes Joshua&#8217;s search for Achan (<a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a>), reminding us that God can expose hidden sin through human leadership when that leadership seeks His verdict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cast the lot</b><p>Throughout Scripture, lots are used to discover God&#8217;s will (<a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8-10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). Saul is relying on that accepted practice, believing that &#8220;the decision is from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). While Saul&#8217;s oath was misguided, the act of casting lots still reflects faith in divine sovereignty: the outcome is not random but directed by God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>between me and my son Jonathan</b><p>Saul sets the boundary narrowly&#8212;just himself and Jonathan&#8212;because the wider casting has already cleared the troops (<a href="/1_samuel/14-40.htm">1 Samuel 14:40-41</a>). This phrasing signals impartiality; even the king and the crown prince must answer to God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>). Saul&#8217;s earlier vow, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, even if it is my son Jonathan, he will die&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>), now meets its test.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Jonathan was selected</b><p>God allows the lot to single out Jonathan, the very one who initiated the victorious attack in faith (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-14</a>). Though Jonathan&#8217;s taste of honey was unintentional (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>), the selection proves two truths:<p>&#8226; Nothing remains hidden before God (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Rash vows can entangle even the innocent (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2-6</a>; <a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34-35</a>).<p>Jonathan accepts the result without protest (<a href="/1_samuel/14-43.htm">1 Samuel 14:43</a>), contrasting Saul&#8217;s impulsiveness with humble submission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a> shows Saul turning to the God-ordained practice of casting lots to identify the oath-breaker. By limiting the draw to himself and Jonathan, he claims impartiality, and God honors the process by pointing to Jonathan. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s sovereignty works through established means, that leadership is accountable, and that careless vows carry real consequences&#8212;even for the faithful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
