This moment occurs after David has heard Goliath's challenge and has volunteered to fight the Philistine giant. David's reply is significant as it demonstrates his confidence and faith, rooted in his past experiences. His response is not just a defense of his capability but also a testament to his trust in God's deliverance.<p><b>Your servant has been tending his father&#8217;s sheep</b><br>David identifies himself as a servant, highlighting his humility and obedience. Tending sheep was a common occupation in ancient Israel, often assigned to the youngest in the family. This role required vigilance, courage, and care, qualities that David would later exhibit as a leader and king. The imagery of a shepherd is also a powerful biblical motif, later used to describe Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>and whenever a lion or a bear came</b><br>Lions and bears were known predators in the region of ancient Israel, posing real threats to livestock. David's mention of these animals underscores the danger he faced and overcame. This experience in the wilderness prepared him for future challenges, including his confrontation with Goliath. The reference to these predators also symbolizes the spiritual and physical battles believers face, requiring reliance on God's strength.<p><b>and carried off a lamb from the flock</b><br>The loss of a lamb would have been significant, as each animal was valuable to the family's livelihood. David's responsibility was to protect the flock, reflecting his dedication and bravery. This phrase also foreshadows the sacrificial nature of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was taken for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). David's willingness to risk his life for the sheep prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, a shepherd boy who would later become the king of Israel.

Instead of echoing Israel&#8217;s fear, he speaks up with calm assurance. &#8226; His readiness to answer mirrors <a href="/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32</a>: &#8220;Do not let anyone lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.&#8221; &#8226; Years earlier, the prophet had anointed him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), so David&#8217;s reply now flows from confidence that the LORD who chose him still guides him. &#8226; Like Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>) or Peter before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8-10</a>), David demonstrates that faith compels respectful yet fearless speech. The verse opens, then, by showing a heart already settled on God&#8217;s faithfulness before any battle begins.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your servant has been tending his father&#8217;s sheep,</b><p>David places himself in the lowly role of a shepherd, emphasizing service rather than self-promotion. &#8226; Tending sheep is the task Samuel found him doing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>), and it forged habits of watchfulness (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>). &#8226; Scripture often links shepherding with leadership&#8212;God lifts the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>) and equips them for greater responsibility (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). &#8226; The phrase also hints at Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), showing how God shapes deliverers in quiet pastures long before public victory. By pointing to ordinary faithfulness, David reminds Saul that God trains His servants in hidden places.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whenever a lion or a bear came</b><p>Real predators, not symbols, stalked Judah&#8217;s hills. &#8226; <a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5-6</a> records Samson&#8217;s encounter with a lion, confirming such threats were literal. &#8226; Scripture portrays both lion and bear as forces of danger (<a href="/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>), and Peter later warns believers that the devil &#8220;prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). &#8226; David&#8217;s calm recall of these beasts underscores experiential trust: past deliverances prove God&#8217;s ongoing power (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>). What terrifies others, he treats as familiar territory because the LORD has been his protector.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and carried off a lamb from the flock,</b><p>The enemy&#8217;s theft triggers David&#8217;s courageous response. &#8226; A hired hand might flee (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>), but a true shepherd risks everything for one lamb (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>). &#8226; Israel itself is often called God&#8217;s flock (<a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>); thus David&#8217;s defense of sheep foreshadows his later role as king who guards God&#8217;s people (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). &#8226; Each rescue reveals God&#8217;s heart: He notices when even one vulnerable life is snatched away (<a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12-14</a>). By recalling these rescues, David shows Saul that confronting Goliath is simply an extension of the same protective zeal empowered by the same faithful God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a> highlights David&#8217;s proven faithfulness, God-honed courage, and shepherd&#8217;s heart. Quiet years of diligent service prepared him to confront giant threats with unshakable confidence in the LORD. The verse reminds believers today that steadfast obedience in small responsibilities equips us for larger battles, and the God who delivered then still delivers now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Thy servant kept his father's sheep.</span>--Here follows in the colloquy between the king and the boy that simple brave narrative which children listen to with glowing cheeks--that simple story, bearing the stamp of truth on every word--of what had happened to him in past days. Fierce wild animals, the terror of the Hebrew shepherds, had attacked his flock: these he had met and slain, almost without arms. <span class= "ital">Another </span>had helped him when he did his brave duty <span class= "ital">then; </span>and he felt that the same invisible Guardian would give him nerve and strength <span class= "ital">now </span>in this more dangerous encounter.

There was nothing to fear; he <span class= "ital">must </span>succeed, he and his Divine Helper!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-36.</span> - David does not appeal to any feat of arms. He may have served with credit in repelling some Philistine foray, but these combats with wild beasts, fought without the presence of spectators, and with no regent necessity (as most shepherds would have been too glad to compound with such enemies by letting them take a lamb without molestation), still more clearly proved David's fearless nature. Lions and bears were both common in ancient times in Palestine, when the country was more densely covered with wood; and bears are numerous in the mountainous districts now. Lions seem to have been less feared than bears (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>); but Canon Tristram thinks there were two species of the lion in Palestine - one short-maned, which was not very formidable, the other long maned, which was more fierce and dangerous ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 117). The Hebrew literally is, "There came the lion and even the bear," the articles implying that they were the well known foes of the shepherd. The written text has <span class="accented">zeh</span>, "this," for <span class="accented">seh</span>, "a lamb," probably a mere variety of spelling. There can be little doubt that David refers to two different occasions, especially as bears and lions never hunt in company. <span class="cmt_word">By his beard.</span> Neither the bear nor the lion has a beard, and the word really means "the chin," "the place where the beard grows." The Chaldee translates <span class="accented">the lower jaw</span>, and the Septuagint <span class="accented">the throat.</span> It is plain from this description that David slew the beast with his staff. <span class="cmt_word">He arose against me.</span> This shows that the combat thus particularly described was with the bear, which does thus rise on its hind legs to grapple with its foe, while the lion crouches and then springs. Pliny also says that the weakest part of a bear is its head, and that it can be killed by a smart blow there. The manner in which David killed the lion is not described. <span class="cmt_word">Defied</span>.
