The "day" refers to the time when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Kiriath-jearim after being returned by the Philistines. The long duration suggests a period of spiritual stagnation and reflection for Israel, as they were without the Ark in its rightful place in the tabernacle. This waiting period can be seen as a time of preparation for the leadership of Samuel, who would guide Israel back to faithfulness.<p><b>twenty years in all,</b><br>The specific mention of "twenty years" highlights the patience required during this time. Biblically, the number twenty can symbolize a period of waiting or testing. This duration also sets the stage for the eventual revival under Samuel's leadership. It reflects a time when Israel was without the visible presence of God, as represented by the Ark, which was central to their worship and identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim.</b><br>Kiriath-jearim, a town in the territory of Judah, became the temporary resting place for the Ark. This location was significant because it was not the central place of worship, Shiloh, where the Ark had previously been housed. The Ark's presence in Kiriath-jearim symbolizes a period of dislocation and the need for Israel to return to proper worship. Archaeological evidence suggests Kiriath-jearim was a fortified city, which may have provided security for the Ark during this time.<p><b>And all the house of Israel mournfully sought the LORD.</b><br>This phrase indicates a collective spiritual awakening and repentance among the Israelites. The mourning reflects their recognition of sin and the absence of God's favor. Seeking the LORD suggests a desire to return to covenant faithfulness and to restore their relationship with God. This period of seeking is reminiscent of other biblical calls to repentance, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear and heal the land if His people humble themselves and pray. This turning back to God sets the stage for Samuel's leadership and the eventual anointing of a king, which would lead to the establishment of the Davidic line, a type of Christ as the ultimate King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with Israel.

That long wait exposed the emptiness of life lived without wholehearted devotion. At last the nation&#8217;s sorrow turned to seeking, and God answered through Samuel&#8217;s leadership. The verse reminds us that while God&#8217;s presence may be near, renewal comes only when His people earnestly turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And it came to pass, from the day that the Ark rested at Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years. </span>There is something very touching in this sad note of time. We think we read Samuel's own words here. The unwearied toiler for God and His dear people found the twenty years a weary period of waiting. We must not, however, by any means suppose that the hungering of Israel after their God-Friend only began after the twenty years of sorrow were over.<p>It had been a stern trial time. The great victory of Aphek and the destruction of Shiloh had laid all Israel at the feet of their Philistine enemies, and they, we know, made their supremacy bitterly felt. The restoration of the Ark in no wise signified that they loosed their hold on the conquered people. This long time, when the hand of Philistia pressed so heavily on Israel, was the important period of Samuel's life. For these twenty years he must have laboured incessantly to wake up the old worship of the Eternal and the pure life loved by God among the people. The early dreams of his boy days, the hopes excited by his burning enthusiasm, were scattered to the winds.<p>The fatal battle of Aphek, the capture of the holy Ark, the death of his old guardian, the great high priestly judge Eli, the sack and devastation of Shiloh, the loved sanctuary, the terrible and continued oppression of Philistia, had opened the eyes of the young inspired man of God. Taught by the bitter lessons of adversity, he saw it was by no bold stroke of a few gallant patriots that the nation could be saved; all such efforts Samuel the seer, after the crushing defeat of Aphek, saw would only sink the nation into still lower depths of degradation and misery. Other and different things were needed before the lion standard of Judah could be safely unfurled, or the war-cry of Ephraim raised on her mountains. "What means he used we are not told, or what was his mode of life during those twenty years of waiting and work; but probably the life of the young prophet-judge was that of a fugitive, going stealthily from place to place that he might teach and preach, hiding in the caverns in the limestone ranges of Judaea, emerging thence to visit now one quarter of the country and now another, ever in danger, but gradually stirring up, not merely those districts which were contiguous to the Philistines, but all Israel to a sense of the greatness of their sins, and to the necessity of renewed trust in and return of old love to their God. And so a fresh spiritual life by degrees sprang up among the people, and with it came the certainty of the future restoration of their national independence."--<span class= "ital">Dean Payne Smith.</span><p><span class= "bld">And all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.</span>--The English Version is singularly happy here. The Hebrew word Englished by "lamented after" has been variously rendered and paraphrased. The Syriac translates, "they all cast themselves down after Jehovah." Gesenius and some would translate "were assembled together;" others, "the people of Israel quieted themselves, and in quiet devotion followed Jehovah," but the English Version is best on all grounds. This "lamenting" or <span class= "ital">"</span>hungering after the Lord" was a gradual result of Samuel's unwearied labours. The assertion of <a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm" title="And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.">1Samuel 3:19</a>, that "none of his words fell to the ground," especially belongs to this period of restless activity, when dangers and apparently insurmountable difficulties hemmed him in; slowly, but surely, the heart of the people, roused by his loving but passionate appeals, returned to their Eternal Friend; sick of crime and folly, gradually they began to hate their impurity and moral degradation; by degrees they began to loathe their idolatry; and when Samuel, after his twenty years of faithful restless work among them, summoned them boldly to declare their abhorrence of the strange Philistine gods, and the life taught and lived by the Philistine peoples, the heart of all Israel responded with intense gladness to the summons.<p>Then the wise and patriotic statesman-prophet saw the hour of deliverance and national restoration had struck. No longer solitary hamlets and scattered families mourned after the glorious Eternal and His pure holy worship and life; but the heart of a whole people mourned after the Lord, and hungered for His presence among them once more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While the ark,</span> etc. The literal translation of this verse is, "And it came to pass, from the day that the ark rested at Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years." The words dwell wearily upon the length of this mournful period, during which. Israel was in a state of subjection to the Philistines, with its national life crushed to the ground, and its strength wasted by unjust exactions and misrule. For though the Philistines gave up the ark, there was no restoration of the national worship, nor did they abandon the political fruits of their victory at Eben-ezer. But quietly and calmly Samuel was labouring to put all things right. It was the principle of the theocracy that Jehovah punished his subjects for their sins by withdrawing his protection, and that on their repentance he took again his place at their head as their king, and delivered them. Samuel's whole effort, therefore, was directed to bringing the people to repentance. What means he used we are not told, nor what was his mode of life; but probably it was that of a fugitive, going stealthily from place to place that he might teach and preach, hiding in the caverns in the limestone range of Judaea, emerging thence to visit now one quarter of the country and now another, ever in danger, but gradually awakening, not merely those districts which were contiguous to the Philistines, but all Israel to a sense of the greatness of their sins, and the necessity of renewed trust and love to their God. And so a fresh spiritual life sprang up among the people, and with it came the certainty of the restoration of their national independence. <span class="cmt_word">All the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.</span> The word used here is rare, and the versions all differ in their translation of it. Really it is a happy one, embracing the two ideas of sorrow for sin, and also of re. turning to and gathering themselves round Jehovah. The Syriac alone retains this double meaning, by saying that "they all cast themselves down after Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that they sought him with deep humility. Gradually, then, a change of heart came over the people; but the removal of the ark to a more fit place, and the restoration of Divine service with ministering priests and Levites, could take place only after the Philistine yoke had been broken. From <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19 22</a> we learn how vigilant and oppressive that tyranny was; and the heart of the writer, in inditing this verse, was full of sorrow at the thought that the repentance of Israel was so slow and unready, and that therefore it had to wait twenty years before deliverance came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And from that day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
