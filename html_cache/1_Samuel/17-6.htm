Bronze was a common material for armor in the ancient Near East due to its durability and effectiveness in battle. The mention of leg armor suggests comprehensive protection, indicating Goliath's preparedness and the Philistines' military sophistication. This detail highlights the formidable nature of Goliath, emphasizing the challenge he posed to the Israelites. The use of bronze also connects to other biblical references where bronze symbolizes strength and judgment, such as in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2-4</a>).<p><b>and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders</b><br>The javelin, a weapon for both throwing and thrusting, underscores Goliath's role as a warrior skilled in various forms of combat. The fact that it was slung between his shoulders suggests readiness and ease of access, indicating Goliath's experience and confidence in battle. The use of bronze for the javelin further emphasizes the Philistines' technological advantage over the Israelites, who were less equipped with such advanced weaponry. This detail sets the stage for the dramatic contrast between Goliath's might and David's reliance on God's power, foreshadowing the victory that comes not through human strength but through divine intervention. The imagery of the javelin also connects to other biblical narratives where God uses the weak to overcome the strong, as seen in the story of Gideon (Judges 7).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A Philistine giant from Gath, known for his immense size and strength, who challenged the Israelites and defied their God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel, often at war with them during the time of the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by King Saul at this time, who were facing the Philistine threat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The location where the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines took place, and where David eventually defeated Goliath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who would later become the king of Israel, known for his faith in God and his victory over Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_physical_vs._spiritual_armor.htm">Reliance on Physical vs. Spiritual Armor</a></b><br>Goliath's confidence was in his physical armor and weapons, while David's confidence was in the Lord.

Together they describe a warrior thoroughly covered from head to toe.<p>&#8226; Bronze, a harder metal than iron in the late Bronze Age, signaled cutting-edge military technology and wealth (<a href="/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16</a>). To the Israelite lines, this would underline the Philistine superiority in arms much as Egypt&#8217;s chariots once intimidated Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail magnifies the contrast when David steps forward later with no visible armor at all (<a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38-40</a>), reminding us that &#8220;the LORD saves not with sword and spear&#8221; (verse 47).<p>&#8226; Spiritual parallels surface in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-15</a>, where believers are told to stand firm with God&#8217;s armor. Goliath trusted bronze; David trusted the Lord of hosts.<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the greaves also guard the shins&#8212;vital for balance. The narrative hints that even unbeatable human footing can be taken out by a single God-guided stone (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders</b><p>&#8220;and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wording portrays a curved throwing spear riding across Goliath&#8217;s back, ready to be whipped forward. It supplements the massive spear described in the next verse (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>), showing he carried both close-quarter and ranged weapons.<p>&#8226; Joshua used a javelin as a signal of conquest at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-18.htm">Joshua 8:18, 26</a>); Saul later hurled his at David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a>; 19:9-10). In each scene, the javelin represents human aggression that the Lord ultimately overturns.<p>&#8226; By specifying that even this secondary weapon was bronze, the text keeps piling weight onto the image of invincibility. Goliath appears unbeatable, yet he will fall before an unarmored shepherd&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>, &#8220;No king is saved by the size of his army.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The placement &#8220;between his shoulders&#8221; highlights readiness and confidence. David, by contrast, carries only his staff and sling, reflecting reliance on God rather than hardware (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40, 45</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/41-29.htm">Job 41:29</a> notes that to Leviathan, &#8220;a javelin is regarded as straw,&#8221; underscoring how God alone can render fearsome weapons powerless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a> underscores Goliath&#8217;s overwhelming military advantage. His bronze greaves protect his stride; his bronze javelin signals lethal reach. These concrete details set up the stunning reversal where an apparently defenseless youth defeats a fully armored giant. The verse therefore magnifies God&#8217;s power to save, highlighting the futility of trusting mere metal when the battle belongs to the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[He had] armor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
