His declaration is a pronouncement of divine judgment, reflecting his role as a mediator between God and the people. This moment underscores the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands, as seen earlier in the chapter when Saul failed to fully carry out God's instructions regarding the Amalekites.<p><b>&#8220;As your sword has made women childless,</b><br>This phrase highlights the violence and destruction caused by Agag, the king of the Amalekites. Historically, the Amalekites were known for their brutal attacks on Israel, including their ambush on the Israelites during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). The reference to making women childless indicates the loss and suffering inflicted by Agag's actions, which were contrary to God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>so your mother will be childless among women.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's pronouncement is a form of poetic justice, where Agag's own actions are turned back upon him. The cultural context of the time placed great importance on lineage and descendants, making this a severe judgment. The loss of a child was a profound tragedy, and this statement emphasizes the completeness of Agag's downfall.<p><b>And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces</b><br>This act of execution by Samuel is a fulfillment of God's command to utterly destroy the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). It demonstrates the seriousness of God's judgment and the necessity of obedience. The act also serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and disobedience, reinforcing the theme of divine justice.<p><b>before the LORD at Gilgal.</b><br>Gilgal holds significant historical and spiritual importance as the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was a place of covenant renewal and commitment to God. Performing this act "before the LORD" signifies that it was done in accordance with divine will and under God's authority, emphasizing the sacredness and gravity of the moment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a key figure in the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy.
