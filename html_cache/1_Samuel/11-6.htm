The context is significant as it highlights the early days of Saul's reign as king of Israel. The people of Jabesh-gilead were in a desperate situation, and their plea for help reached Saul, who was still in the process of establishing his authority. This moment is pivotal as it demonstrates Saul's initial response to his kingly duties and the expectations of leadership in ancient Israel.<p><b>the Spirit of God rushed upon him</b><br>The phrase indicates a divine empowerment that Saul received, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament when God equips individuals for specific tasks. This rushing of the Spirit signifies God's direct intervention and approval of Saul's actions. It parallels other instances in the Bible, such as the Spirit coming upon Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), indicating a special anointing for leadership and deliverance. This divine empowerment is crucial for understanding the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king was expected to act as God's representative.<p><b>and he burned with great anger</b><br>Saul's anger is described as a righteous indignation, fueled by the Spirit of God. This anger is not merely human emotion but a reflection of God's own displeasure with the oppression of His people. It is reminiscent of the anger of Moses when he saw the Israelites worshiping the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) and Jesus' anger in the temple (<a href="/mark/11-15.htm">Mark 11:15-17</a>). This righteous anger propels Saul into action, marking a decisive moment in his leadership. It underscores the biblical principle that anger, when aligned with God's purposes, can lead to justice and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

On Saul's heart, thus prepared for action, the Holy Spirit fell, and endued him with extraordinary wisdom, valour, and power for the great and difficult work which lay before him.<p>We read of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon men like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>) and the other great Israelitic judges, who were raised up to be in their day the deliverers of the people; and the immediate result of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon them was to impart new and unusual power to their spirit, power which enabled them successfully to surmount every danger and difficulty which barred the progress of the great work they were specially called upon to do.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit of God came upon Saul.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">descended mightily</span> upon Saul (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>). No miraculous influence is here meant; far more full of meaning and piety is the lesson so constantly taught in the Book of Judges, that all mighty and noble acts are from God (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; <a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>, etc.). Even the heathen saw in enthusiasm something Divine, for it means the having God within. The energy with which Saul acted was strictly natural, but yet as truly Divine; and it is a sign of the irreligion of modern days that it can see and hear of great and heroic achievements and assign no part in them to God. In the days of Samuel and the judges the whole glory of such acts was ascribed to God. But equally now, whenever men are moved to noble acts, it is "the breath of God" that descends upon them and inspires them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Saul heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
