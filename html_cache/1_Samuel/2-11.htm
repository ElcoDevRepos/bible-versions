Ramah, located in the hill country of Ephraim, is significant as the birthplace and home of Samuel, and later becomes a central location in Israel's history. This journey back to Ramah signifies a return to daily life after a period of worship and sacrifice, highlighting the rhythm of worship and work in the life of a faithful Israelite. The mention of Ramah connects to other biblical figures, such as the prophet Samuel, who would later anoint the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.<p><b>but the boy began ministering to the LORD</b><br>The "boy" refers to Samuel, who was dedicated to the LORD by his mother, Hannah, as a fulfillment of her vow. Samuel's early ministry is a precursor to his significant role as a prophet, judge, and leader in Israel. His service to the LORD at such a young age underscores the importance of dedication and service to God from an early age. This phrase also foreshadows Samuel's future as a faithful servant of God, contrasting with the corrupt practices of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas. Samuel's ministry is a type of Christ, who also began His Father's work at a young age, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>.<p><b>before Eli the priest</b><br>Eli, the high priest at Shiloh, serves as a mentor and guardian for Samuel. This relationship is crucial, as Eli's guidance provides Samuel with the spiritual foundation necessary for his future leadership. However, Eli's own household is marked by corruption, as his sons abuse their priestly roles. This juxtaposition highlights the purity of Samuel's service in contrast to the moral failings of Eli's sons. Eli's role as priest connects to the broader Levitical priesthood established in the Mosaic Law, which points to the ultimate high priesthood of Jesus Christ, who intercedes for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A devout man from the hill country of Ephraim, Elkanah is the father of Samuel.

The word "minister is the official term used to signify the duties performed by priests and Levites in connection with the service of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The child did minister.</span> Left by his parents at Shiloh, Samuel ministered unto the Lord; that is, certain duties were allotted him to perform suited to his age; but few at first, when he was but three years old, but increasing in importance as time went on; for the words refer to the whole period of his service, until Eli's death. At first Samuel would be but a scholar, for, as we have mentioned on 1 Samuel 1:21, there were, no doubt, regulations for the training of children devoted to the service of the sanctuary. The peculiarity about Samuel was that he was devoted for life, for possibly it was a not uncommon practice for young persons to receive some training at Shiloh; just as we find that Samuel himself subsequently gathered youths round him at Naioth in Ramah for educational purposes. Learning practically was confined to the priesthood, and we can scarcely imagine that the knowledge which Phinehas and the family of Aaron brought with them out of Egypt would be allowed to perish. Samuel certainly had himself received careful instruction (see on 1 Samuel 10:25), and this could scarcely have happened if the training of young persons had not been part of the priests' duties at Shiloh. This then explains why Samuel was brought to Eli at so tender an age, and why the charge of so young a child was undertaken without a murmur. Before Eli means under his general superintendence. Everything done at Shiloh was done <span class="accented">before Eli</span>, as being the chief ruler there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elkanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;q&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_511.htm">Strong's 511: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elkanah -- 'God has created', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1447;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
