The Philistines were a seafaring people, often at odds with the Israelites. Historically, they were known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, including the use of iron. This call to courage reflects the high stakes of the battle, as the Philistines faced the threat of subjugation. The exhortation to "be men" emphasizes the cultural value placed on bravery and valor in ancient warfare, similar to the exhortations found in other ancient Near Eastern texts.<p><b>Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just as they served you.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the fear of becoming subjugated, a common concern in ancient times when defeated peoples often became slaves or vassals. The Philistines had previously dominated the Israelites, as seen in earlier chapters of 1 Samuel. The reference to serving the Hebrews underscores the cyclical nature of power dynamics in the region. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of reversal, where the oppressed become the oppressors, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of the Exodus.<p><b>Now be men and fight!</b><br>The repetition of the call to "be men" underscores the urgency and desperation of the situation. It serves as a final motivational push for the Philistines to engage in battle with all their might. This phrase can be connected to other biblical exhortations to courage and strength, such as <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God commands Joshua to be strong and courageous. The emphasis on fighting reflects the reality of ancient warfare, where physical combat was the primary means of resolving conflicts. This call to arms is a reminder of the ever-present struggle between the Philistines and Israelites, a conflict that would continue throughout much of the Old Testament narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were often in conflict with the Israelites.

Their first words&#8212;&#8220;Take courage&#8221;&#8212;call the warriors to steel their emotions. Scripture consistently links courage with a conscious decision of the will: &#8220;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Like Moses urging Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>) and Joab rallying his men (<a href="/2_samuel/10-12.htm">2 Samuel 10:12</a>), these pagan leaders understand that fear must be replaced by firm resolve, even when they stand on the wrong side of truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and be men</b><p>The exhortation moves from inner resolve to outward action. &#8220;Act like men; be strong&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>) mirrors the same idea centuries later: responsibility, steadfastness, and readiness for hardship. David later charges Solomon, &#8220;Be strong and prove yourself a man&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>). Manliness here is not mere bravado; it is decisive commitment to a cause&#8212;however flawed that cause may be for the Philistines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Philistines!</b><p>Naming the nation personalizes the charge. The generals do not speak in abstractions; they address their own people, much as Gideon called, &#8220;Arise! For the LORD has delivered the Midianite camp into your hands&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-15.htm">Judges 7:15</a>). The Philistines are polytheists, but they recognize Israel&#8217;s unique God (<a href="/1_samuel/4-8.htm">1 Samuel 4:8</a>). Fear of His power forces them to summon every ounce of national identity and pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews</b><p>Service here is literal enslavement&#8212;a fate the Philistines find intolerable. Earlier, God warned Israel that disobedience would lead to foreign domination (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>), and the people indeed served the Philistines for forty years. Now the tables could turn. The threat of bondage motivates even the ungodly to desperate action, highlighting how God can use fear to accomplish larger redemptive purposes (cf. <a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as they served you</b><p>The leaders remind the troops of their prior dominance. Memory of victory fuels present confidence: &#8220;The Philistines ruled over Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>), so why assume defeat now? Yet the statement also unwittingly echoes a biblical pattern: God often reverses roles&#8212;Egypt endures the plagues it once imposed on others; Haman dies on the gallows he built; here, the oppressors dread becoming the oppressed (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now be men and fight!</b><p>The final rally repeats the central charge, tightening focus on immediate action. Israel&#8217;s enemies believe sheer courage can overcome divine power; Saul will later think the same when facing Goliath. By contrast, Jonathan understands, &#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). In the coming clash God will judge both nations: He disciplines Israel for irreverence toward the ark and exposes Philistine idolatry by toppling Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>). Human valor stands no chance against divine holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a> captures a pagan pep talk that unknowingly affirms biblical truths: courage is a choice, masculine resolve counts, national identity can stir action, and fear of bondage drives people to fight. Yet the verse also reveals the limits of human strength. The Philistines may muster valor, but God alone determines victory. The passage invites us to cultivate godly courage&#8212;relying not on flesh but on the Lord who overturns oppressors and upholds His holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Be strong, . . . O ye Philistines . . .</span>--The ring of these striking words--part of the same Philistine tradition of their splendid success--probably embodied in some well-known hymn of victory, was evidently in St. Paul's mind when he wrote his stirring words of exhortation to his loved Corinthian Church, "Quit ye like men; be strong."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be strong.</span> But, as is often the case, despair served only to nerve them to bitter determination.
