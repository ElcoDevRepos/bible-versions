In the context of ancient Israel, only priests or prophets like Samuel were authorized to offer sacrifices. Saul's actions demonstrate a lack of faith and trust in God's timing. This event occurs at a critical moment when the Philistines are threatening Israel, and Saul's army is scattering. Saul's decision to offer the burnt offering himself reflects a common human tendency to take matters into one's own hands rather than waiting on divine instruction. This act of presumption foreshadows the eventual loss of his kingdom, as it directly disobeys the command given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>.<p><b>Samuel arrived</b><br>Samuel's arrival immediately after Saul's unauthorized sacrifice underscores the importance of obedience and timing in God's plan. Samuel, as a prophet, represents God's voice and authority. His timely arrival serves as a test of Saul's faith and patience. Theologically, this moment illustrates the principle that God's timing is perfect, and human impatience can lead to dire consequences. Samuel's presence also signifies the divine order and the importance of adhering to God's established leadership and priesthood.<p><b>and Saul went out to greet him</b><br>Saul's action of going out to greet Samuel can be seen as an attempt to justify or cover up his disobedience. In the cultural context of the time, greeting someone was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of authority. However, Saul's greeting is overshadowed by his prior disobedience. This moment reflects the tension between outward appearances and inward reality, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Saul's greeting may also indicate his awareness of having overstepped his bounds, as he seeks to placate Samuel. This encounter sets the stage for Samuel's rebuke and the prophetic declaration of the end of Saul's dynasty, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel.

The burnt offering&#8212;intended to symbolize total surrender to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>)&#8212;is here performed in self-reliance, emptying it of its intended meaning.<p>&#8226; Obedience must precede worship; compare <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221; The verse shows that finishing a religious act apart from God&#8217;s timing equals disobedience, not devotion.<p>&#8226; Waiting on the Lord, even when circumstances press, is a recurring biblical principle (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). Saul misses the blessing that would have come from patient trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel arrived</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s prophet appears the moment Saul&#8217;s unlawful worship ends, highlighting that God&#8217;s tests often climax right before deliverance (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrival reveals God&#8217;s faithfulness; Samuel isn&#8217;t late, Saul is impatient. This contrasts the Lord&#8217;s perfect timing (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By sending Samuel precisely then, God exposes Saul&#8217;s heart: outward religiosity cannot mask inward distrust (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that spiritual authority belongs to those God appoints, not those who seize it (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul went out to greet him</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew narrative suggests Saul hastily &#8220;blessed&#8221; Samuel&#8212;similar to his later self-justifying greeting in <a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13</a>.<p>&#8226; Instead of immediate confession, Saul tries to manage appearances, reflecting pride that &#8220;goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s approach foreshadows Cain&#8217;s failed attempt to look acceptable after disobedience (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine fellowship with God&#8217;s messenger demands humility; compare David&#8217;s response to Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>, a model of swift repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a> captures the tragic hinge of Saul&#8217;s reign. At the very moment he finishes a sacrifice he was never authorized to make, God&#8217;s prophet arrives, exposing his impatience and self-reliance. Saul&#8217;s rushed greeting reveals a heart more concerned with optics than obedience. The verse teaches that timing matters in God&#8217;s economy, worship divorced from obedience is empty, and prideful self-initiative forfeits divine favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Behold, Samuel came.</span>--Scarcely does the sacrificial ceremony appear to have been completed when the seer appeared on the scene.<p>It was the seventh day, according to the solemn injunction given to the king, but Saul, in his impatience, had not waited till the end of the day.<p><span class= "bld">Saul went out to meet him.</span>--The reverence which the king, in spite of his disobedience, felt for Samuel is displayed in his going out to meet him thus publicly.
