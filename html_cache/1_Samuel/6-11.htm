The use of a cart to transport the Ark contrasts with the prescribed method given to the Israelites, where the Ark was to be carried by Levites using poles (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). This reflects a lack of understanding or disregard for the sacredness of the Ark. The Ark symbolizes God's presence and covenant with Israel, and its improper handling often led to dire consequences, as seen later with Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>along with the chest containing the gold rats</b><br>The gold rats were part of a guilt offering to the God of Israel, acknowledging the plagues that had afflicted the Philistines. Rats were likely chosen because they were associated with the devastation of crops, possibly linked to the plagues. This act of sending gold representations of the affliction shows an understanding of appeasement, similar to offerings in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. The use of gold signifies the value and seriousness of the offering.<p><b>and the images of the tumors</b><br>The images of the tumors were also part of the guilt offering, representing the physical afflictions suffered by the Philistines. This reflects a belief in sympathetic magic, where a representation of the affliction is offered to remove the actual affliction. The tumors, possibly related to bubonic plague, were a direct result of the Philistines' possession of the Ark. This offering acknowledges the power of the God of Israel and serves as a plea for relief.
