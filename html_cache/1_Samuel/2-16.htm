This was a commandment given by God, signifying the best part of the sacrifice being offered to Him. The priests, however, were entitled to certain portions of the sacrifice after the fat was burned (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>). The man&#8217;s insistence on burning the fat first reflects a desire to adhere to the proper worship practices and honor God&#8217;s commandments. This phrase highlights the tension between the corrupt practices of Eli&#8217;s sons and the faithful Israelites who sought to follow God&#8217;s law.<p><b>the servant would reply, &#8220;No, you must give it to me right now.</b><br>The servant&#8217;s response indicates a blatant disregard for the sacrificial laws and a prioritization of personal gain over divine command. This reflects the moral and spiritual decline among the priesthood during this period. The demand for immediate gratification without regard for God&#8217;s instructions is a recurring theme in Scripture, often leading to judgment and downfall (e.g., Esau selling his birthright in <a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>). This behavior contrasts with the patience and obedience exemplified by figures like Abraham, who waited for God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>).<p><b>If you refuse, I will take it by force!&#8221;</b><br>The threat of force underscores the corruption and abuse of power by Eli&#8217;s sons, Hophni and Phinehas. Their actions were not only a violation of God&#8217;s law but also an exploitation of their position, leading to widespread contempt for the sacrificial system (<a href="/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>). This abuse of power is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where leaders failed to uphold justice and righteousness, such as the wickedness of the judges in the book of Judges. The coercion and violence used here foreshadow the eventual downfall of Eli&#8217;s house, as prophesied by the man of God in <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>.
