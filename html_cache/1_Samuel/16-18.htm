This phrase indicates the proactive role of Saul's servants in seeking a solution. Servants in ancient Israel often held significant responsibilities and could influence decisions, as seen here.<p><b>I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem</b><br>Jesse is introduced as the father of David, who is from Bethlehem. Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, is significant as the birthplace of David and later Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah's lineage (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). This connection underscores the importance of David's origins in biblical history.<p><b>who knows how to play the harp</b><br>David's skill with the harp is highlighted, showing his musical talent. Music played a vital role in ancient Israelite culture, often used in worship and royal courts. David's ability to play the harp foreshadows his role in composing many of the Psalms, which are central to worship in both Jewish and Christian traditions.<p><b>He is a mighty man of valor</b><br>This description of David emphasizes his bravery and strength, qualities that would later be demonstrated in his battle with Goliath (1 Samuel 17). The term "mighty man of valor" is often used in the Old Testament to describe warriors and leaders, indicating David's potential as a future king.<p><b>a warrior</b><br>David's reputation as a warrior is established early, even before his famous encounter with Goliath. This characteristic is crucial for his future role as a military leader and king of Israel, who would expand and secure the nation's borders.<p><b>eloquent and handsome</b><br>David's eloquence and appearance are noted, suggesting his ability to communicate effectively and his favorable presence. These traits would aid him in gaining favor with both God and people, as seen in his interactions with Saul, Jonathan, and the people of Israel.<p><b>and the LORD is with him</b><br>This phrase is the most significant, indicating divine favor and presence with David. It echoes the biblical theme that true success and leadership come from God's presence and blessing. This divine endorsement sets David apart and foreshadows his anointing as king, aligning with the biblical narrative that God chooses leaders based on the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). David's life and reign are often seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate anointed one, who would also be known for God's presence with Him (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The son of Jesse, described as skilled in music, a brave warrior, articulate, handsome, and most importantly, having the LORD with him.

In each of these passages the Hebrew word rendered "servant," no doubt signifies officers connected with the royal court. Here the different word <span class= "ital">hann'-?rim </span>lays stress on the royal attendant in question being a <span class= "ital">young man. </span>Probably, the one spoken of in this place was a contemporary of David, very likely a youth trained with David in Samuel's prophetic school at Naioth in Ramah, and consequently able to speak thus in detail about the young shepherd pupil of the great seer.<p><span class= "bld">Cunning in playing.</span>--As a boy, it is certain that David possessed rare gifts of poetry, and, no doubt, of music. It is probable that some of his early Psalms were originally composed while watching his father's sheep among those hills and vales round the village of Bethlehem, where "in later centuries shepherds were still watching over their flocks by night, when the angel host appeared to them to tell them of the birth of a child in Bethlehem."<p>These gifts of poetry and music were further cultivated and developed in the prophets' school of Samuel, and there the young pupil of the seer no doubt quickly acquired among his companions that reputation and skill which induced the "young man" of the court of Saul to tell his afflicted master of the shepherd son of Jesse, famous for his "cunning in playing."<p><span class= "bld">And a mighty valiant man, and a man of war.</span>--The description of the Bethlehemite David at a mighty valiant man can well be explained from what is related in <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34-35</a>, about the young shepherd's prowess in the conflicts with the lions and the bears. A question has, however, been raised respecting the expression "a man of war," as it would seem from the narrative of 1 Samuel 17 that the combat with the giant Philistine was David's first great military exploit. It has, however, been suggested that, in addition to the combat with those wild beasts, which we know in those days frequented the thickets of the Jordan, and were a terror to the Israelitish shepherds, David had most likely been engaged in repelling one or more of the Philistine marauding expeditions so common in those wild days. Bethlehem, we know, was a strong place or garrison of these hereditary foes of Israel. (See <a href="/2_samuel/23-14.htm" title="And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.">2Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-16.htm" title="And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.">1Chronicles 11:16</a>.) . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;han&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m, Article &#124;
