Carmel was known for its fertile land and was a place where Nabal, Abigail's first husband, had significant wealth. The mention of "his servants" refers to David's men, who were sent on his behalf. This reflects the cultural practice of sending representatives to negotiate marriage, a common custom in ancient Israel. The context here follows the death of Nabal, Abigail's first husband, and David's recognition of Abigail's wisdom and character, as seen earlier in the chapter.<p><b>they said, &#8220;David has sent us to take you as his wife.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the proposal of marriage from David to Abigail. In the historical context, marriage was often arranged for political alliances or social stability. David's proposal can be seen as both a personal and strategic decision, as Abigail was known for her intelligence and discernment. This marriage also signifies a new beginning for Abigail, moving from a difficult marriage with Nabal to a union with David, who would later become king. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ's relationship with the Church, where Christ, like David, seeks a bride who is wise and discerning. The act of sending servants can be paralleled with the way God sends His messengers to call people into a relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.
