The presence of an Egyptian in the field suggests a connection to the Amalekites, who had raided Ziklag. Egyptians were often employed as mercenaries or slaves by various groups, including the Amalekites. This encounter is significant as it sets the stage for David's pursuit of the Amalekites. The field represents a place of divine appointment, where God orchestrates events for His purposes.<p><b>and brought him to David</b><br>The act of bringing the Egyptian to David demonstrates the loyalty and initiative of David's men. It also reflects the leadership qualities of David, who was approachable and wise in dealing with unexpected situations. This action is reminiscent of how God often brings people into our lives for a purpose, aligning with the biblical theme of divine guidance and provision. David's role as a leader foreshadows Christ, who draws people to Himself for redemption and restoration.<p><b>They gave the man water to drink and food to eat&#8212;</b><br>Providing water and food to the Egyptian illustrates the principles of compassion and hospitality, which are deeply rooted in biblical teaching. This act of kindness is a reflection of the character of God, who cares for all people, regardless of their background. It also serves as a practical demonstration of the command to love one's neighbor. In a broader sense, this provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers the living water and the bread of life to all who come to Him. The nourishment given to the Egyptian revives him, enabling him to provide crucial information to David, thus advancing God's plan for David's victory over the Amalekites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is leading his men in pursuit of the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David's Men</a></b><br>Loyal followers of David, who are with him during this time of distress and pursuit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptian_servant.htm">Egyptian Servant</a></b><br>A young man found in the field, abandoned by his Amalekite master, who becomes a key figure in David's pursuit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/field.htm">Field</a></b><br>The location where David's men find the Egyptian, symbolizing a place of divine encounter and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town given to David by the Philistine king Achish, which was raided and burned by the Amalekites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>David's men provide for the Egyptian's immediate needs, demonstrating the importance of showing mercy and compassion to those in distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>The encounter with the Egyptian servant is a reminder of God's provision and guidance in unexpected ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_outsider.htm">The Role of the Outsider</a></b><br>The Egyptian, an outsider and enemy, becomes instrumental in David's mission, highlighting how God can use anyone for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_redemption.htm">Restoration and Redemption</a></b><br>The act of feeding and caring for the Egyptian reflects the broader biblical theme of restoration and redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_trust.htm">Obedience and Trust</a></b><br>David's willingness to help the Egyptian, despite the risk, shows trust in God's plan and obedience to His call to love others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_30_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 30:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_30_11_God_s_provision_unexpectedly.htm">How does 1 Samuel 30:11 demonstrate God's provision through unexpected means?

The savage nature of these untamed sons of the desert has been already commented upon when the war of extermination with Amalek was discussed. They seem to have been a ruthless, cruel race, the scourge of the desert, and of the people dwelling near its borders. From the narrative, they had evidently many camels in their force (<a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm" title="And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode on camels, and fled.">1Samuel 30:17</a>), so the abandonment of the sick slave, left, without food or water, to die of hunger, was a needless act of barbarity on their part.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An Egyptian,</span> the slave, as we read in ver. 13, of some Amalekite, left <span class="cmt_word">in the field,</span> in the open common, to perish.
