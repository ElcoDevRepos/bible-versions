Jonathan, the son of King Saul, initiates this covenant with David, signifying a deep bond and commitment. This act is significant as it demonstrates Jonathan's recognition of David's future as God's chosen leader of Israel, despite Jonathan's own royal lineage. The covenant reflects a selfless act of loyalty and friendship, transcending political ambitions. This mirrors the biblical theme of covenant relationships, such as God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, and Israel, emphasizing faithfulness and divine purpose.<p><b>because he loved him as himself</b><br>The phrase highlights the profound and selfless love Jonathan had for David, akin to the commandment found in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "Love your neighbor as yourself." This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through actions and commitments. Jonathan's love for David is a model of true friendship and loyalty, reflecting the love that Jesus Christ later exemplifies in His teachings and sacrifice. The depth of Jonathan's love is further illustrated in his willingness to protect David from Saul's wrath, even at great personal risk. This relationship foreshadows the New Testament teaching of sacrificial love, as seen in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his deep friendship with David.

The verse teaches that true friendship is covenantal, sacrificial, and rooted in shared faith, pointing forward to the ultimate covenant love revealed in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Made a covenant.</span>--The son of the first Hebrew king recognised in David a kindred spirit. They were one in their God, in their faith, in their devotion to the Divine will. Jonathan recognised in the young shepherd, who unarmed went out alone to meet the mighty Philistine warrior, the same spirit of sublime faith in the Invisible King which had inspired him in days far back to go forth alone with his armour-bearer to attack and capture the Philistine stronghold, when he spoke those memorable words which enable us to understand the character of Jonathan: "It may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few" (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm" title="And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.">1Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>The great friendship, which has been the admiration of succeeding generations, began with the strong faith in the Eternal common to the two friends. Throughout its duration the link which united them was an intense desire to do the will of Him who, as true Hebrew patriots, they felt loved Israel; and when the friends parted for the last time in the wilderness of Ziph, we are told how the elder (Jonathan) strengthened the younger (David's) "hand in God" (<a href="/1_samuel/23-16.htm" title="And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.">1Samuel 23:16</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1447;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7733;&#183;r&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
