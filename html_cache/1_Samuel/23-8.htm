His summoning of troops indicates a significant mobilization, reflecting the seriousness with which he viewed David as a threat. This action is consistent with Saul's character, as seen in previous chapters where he frequently gathered forces to pursue David. The summoning of troops also highlights Saul's authority and the centralized power of the monarchy in Israel at the time.<p><b>to go to war at Keilah</b><br>Keilah was a fortified city in the lowlands of Judah, strategically important due to its location. The Philistines had previously attacked Keilah, and David had delivered the city from them, as recorded earlier in the chapter. Saul's decision to go to war at Keilah suggests a tactical move to capture David while he was within the city's walls. This reflects the ongoing conflict between Saul and David, as well as the broader struggle between Israel and the Philistines. The mention of Keilah also underscores the geographical and political complexities of the region during this period.<p><b>and besiege David and his men</b><br>The term "besiege" indicates a military strategy aimed at surrounding and isolating David and his men, cutting off their supplies and escape routes. This reflects Saul's determination to eliminate David, whom he saw as a rival to his throne. David's men, often referred to as his "mighty men," were a group of loyal followers who supported him during his fugitive years. The siege at Keilah is part of the larger narrative of David's rise to power and the divine protection he experienced despite Saul's efforts. This event foreshadows David's eventual kingship and God's providential care over his anointed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Instead of repenting of earlier failures (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>; 18:12), Saul responds with renewed hostility, revealing a heart hardened against God&#8217;s anointed.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; links this action directly to Saul&#8217;s false confidence that &#8220;God has delivered him into my hand&#8221; (23:7). Saul mistakes circumstance for divine sanction, echoing his earlier presumption in offering sacrifice without Samuel (13:8-14).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore marks a turning point: Saul moves from passive pursuit to open, organized aggression, showing how unchecked jealousy escalates into open warfare (cf. <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summoned all his troops</b><p>&#8226; Saul mobilizes the entire standing force (see <a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a> for his constant war footing). This sweeping call underscores how far he is willing to go&#8212;deploying national resources meant for Philistine defense (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>) against a loyal servant.<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights a misuse of authority:<p>&#8211; God-given kingship intended to protect Israel is bent toward personal vengeance (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8211; By contrast, David will later refuse to misuse power against Saul (24:4-7), illustrating the righteous use of authority.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s action also foreshadows the civil strife that will plague Israel when leaders pursue private agendas (<a href="/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go to war at Keilah</b><p>&#8226; Keilah was the very town David had just rescued from Philistine plunder (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-5</a>). Saul&#8217;s march therefore threatens the people he should shield, revealing his warped priorities.<p>&#8226; The choice of Keilah&#8212;an unwalled city (cf. 23:7, &#8220;a city with gates and bars&#8221;)&#8212;suggests Saul expects an easy victory. Instead of fighting Israel&#8217;s true foes, he turns the battlefield inward (<a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode underscores how godless ambition can transform places of recent deliverance into arenas of conflict, a warning echoed later in Absalom&#8217;s coup (<a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and besiege David and his men</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Besiege&#8221; pictures a military encirclement aimed at cutting off escape (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a> for typical siege tactics). Saul intends total containment, not mere skirmish.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s company numbers about six hundred (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>), small compared to Saul&#8217;s army, yet God will protect them, fulfilling earlier promises of kingship (16:13).<p>&#8226; The title of <a href="/bsb/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a> links directly to this event, where David prays, &#8220;Save me, O God, by Your name&#8221; while the Ziphites betray him; God answers, forcing Saul to break off the siege (<a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the siege plan fails, demonstrating <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>: &#8220;There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-8.htm">1 Samuel 23:8</a> exposes Saul&#8217;s tragic descent: a king who marshals Israel&#8217;s army, not against Philistine oppressors, but against God&#8217;s chosen servant. Each phrase reveals a step in that downward spiral&#8212;from the hard &#8220;then&#8221; of jealousy, through the sweeping mobilization of troops, the misguided march toward a recently rescued city, and the ruthless intent to besiege David. The verse warns that when leaders divorce ambition from obedience, they endanger the very people they are called to serve; yet it also sets the stage for God&#8217;s faithful preservation of David, assuring readers that no human scheme can overturn His sovereign purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Saul called all the people together.</span>--Such a summons to war on the part of the sovereign has been always a royal right.
