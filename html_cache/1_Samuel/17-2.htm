The assembly of the men of Israel under Saul's command reflects the centralized leadership that was established during his reign. This gathering for battle is a common occurrence in the historical books of the Old Testament, where Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations. The unity of the men under Saul's leadership is crucial, as it demonstrates the collective effort required to defend the nation.<p><b>and camped in the Valley of Elah</b><br>The Valley of Elah is a significant geographical location in the biblical narrative. It is situated in the Shephelah region, a series of low hills and valleys between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains. This valley served as a strategic military location due to its accessibility and the natural barrier it provided. Archaeological evidence supports the historical accuracy of this location, with findings such as ancient fortifications and artifacts. The Valley of Elah is also notable for its fertile land, which would have been advantageous for sustaining an army.<p><b>arraying themselves for battle</b><br>The phrase suggests a formal preparation for combat, indicating that the Israelites were organized and ready to engage in warfare. This preparation would have included arranging troops in strategic formations, equipping them with weapons, and possibly offering prayers or sacrifices for divine favor. The act of arraying for battle reflects the seriousness of the conflict and the Israelites' reliance on both military strategy and divine intervention.<p><b>against the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were one of Israel's most persistent enemies during the period of the Judges and the early monarchy. They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their advanced military technology, including the use of iron weapons. The conflict with the Philistines is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing the struggle between the people of God and the forces that oppose them. This battle, in particular, sets the stage for the famous encounter between David and Goliath, which foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's anointed over seemingly insurmountable odds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

His presence signals national unity.<p>- &#8220;Men of Israel&#8221; reminds us that the battle belongs to the covenant people, not a private militia (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p>- Earlier victories under Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>; 14:47-48) show that God often tests leaders repeatedly, refining their faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>assembled and camped</b><p>- Gathering reflects obedience to the call to stand together (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>).<p>- Camping implies preparation, not panic:<p>&#8226; time to seek the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/14-36.htm">1 Samuel 14:36-37</a>)<p>&#8226; time to organize (<a href="/numbers/2-1.htm">Numbers 2:1-2</a>)<p>&#8226; time to encourage one another (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>)<p>- <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a> shows the timeless principle: God&#8217;s people strengthen one another when they come together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Valley of Elah</b><p>- A real place southwest of Jerusalem, still identifiable today&#8212;evidence that Scripture records concrete history (<a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>).<p>- Valleys in Scripture often become stages for God&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-17</a>).<p>- The valley setting forces a confrontation neither side can avoid, illustrating how God sometimes narrows our options so His glory is unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>arraying themselves for battle</b><p>- Military order speaks of readiness and discipline (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>).<p>- Yet Israel&#8217;s ultimate confidence must rest in the Lord, not formations (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>- For believers today the application is spiritual: &#8220;Put on the full armor of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).

God allows recurring enemies to train His people in dependence (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-4</a>).<p>- Israel&#8217;s wars prefigure the believer&#8217;s lifelong struggle with the world, the flesh, and the devil (<a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>).<p>- Victory is certain when God&#8217;s people confront opposition in His strength (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2</a> places God&#8217;s covenant people, under their king, in a real valley, deliberately gathered, organized, and poised to face a fierce enemy.

It reminds us that every battle&#8212;literal or spiritual&#8212;belongs to God, who positions His people for His glory and their growth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The valley of Elah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> of the terebinth tree. A valley between them. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:160) describes the spot from personal observation thus: "Saul, coming down by the highway from the land of Benjamin, encamped by the valley on one of the low hills; and between the two hosts was the <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine." In the A.V. no exactness of rendering is ever attempted, and both the <span class="accented">emek</span>, the broad strath or valley of Elah, with gently sloping sides, and the flag, the narrow, precipitous ravine, are equally rendered <span class="accented">valley.</span> Really the <span class="accented">gai</span> is most remarkable, and fully explains how the two hosts could remain in face of one another so long without fighting; for Conder proceeds, "Two points require to be made clear as to the episode of David's battle with Goliath: one was the meaning of the expression <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine; the other was the source whence David took the 'smooth stones.' A visit to the spot explains both. In the middle of the broad, open valley we found a deep trench with vertical sides, impassable except at certain places - a valley in a valley, and a natural barrier between the two hosts. The sides and bed of this trench are strewn with rounded and waterworn pebbles, which would have been well fitted for David's sling. Here, then, we may picture to ourselves the two hosts, covering the low, rocky hills opposite to each other, and half hidden among the lentisk bushes. Between them was the rich expanse of ripening barley, and the red banks of the torrent, with its white, shingly bed. Behind all were the distant blue hill walls of Judah, whence Saul had just come down. The mail clad champion advanced from the west through the low corn, with his mighty lance perhaps tufted with feathers, his brazen helmet shining in the sun. From the east a ruddy boy in his white shirt and sandals, armed with a goat's hair sling, came down to the brook, and, according to the poetic fancy of the Rabbis, the pebbles were given voices, and cried, 'By us shalt thou overcome the giant.' The champion fell from an unseen cause, and the wild Philistines fled to the mouth of the valley, where Gath stood towering on its white chalk cliff, a frontier fortress, the key to the high road leading to the corn lands of Judah and to the vineyards of Hebron." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
