They were often in conflict with the Israelites, as seen throughout the books of Samuel. The Philistines' presence on a hill indicates a strategic military position, as high ground offers a tactical advantage in battle. This setting underscores the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and their enemies, a theme prevalent in the Old Testament.<p><b>and the Israelites stood on another</b><br>The Israelites, God's chosen people, were often depicted in the Old Testament as being in conflict with surrounding nations. Their position on a hill opposite the Philistines symbolizes the standoff between the forces of God and the forces of the world. This imagery can be seen as a representation of spiritual warfare, a concept echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to stand firm against spiritual adversaries.<p><b>with the valley between them.</b><br>The valley, likely the Valley of Elah, served as the battleground for the impending confrontation between David and Goliath. Valleys in biblical narratives often symbolize places of decision and testing. This particular valley becomes the setting for one of the most famous biblical stories, where David's faith in God leads to a miraculous victory. The valley can also be seen as a type of the world, where believers must confront challenges and rely on God's strength to overcome.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during the time of the Old Testament, known for their military prowess and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by King Saul at this time, who were often in conflict with surrounding nations, including the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The geographical location where the battle between the Philistines and Israelites took place.

Between them was the rich expanse of the ripening barley, and the red banks of the torrent, with its white shingly bed. Behind all were the distant blue hill-walls of Judah, whence Saul had just come down. The mail-clad warrior advanced from the west through the low corn, with his mighty lance perhaps tufted with feathers, his brazen helmet shining in the sun. From the east a ruddy boy in his white shirt and sandals, armed with a goat's-hair sling, came down to the brook, and, according to the poetic fancy of the Rabbis, the pebbles were given voices, and cried, 'By us shalt thou overcome the giant !' The champion fell from an unseen cause, and the wild Philistines fled to the mouth of the valley, where Gath stood towering on its white chalk cliff, a frontier fortress, the key to the high road leading to the corn-lands of Judah and to the vineyards of Hebron."<p><span class= "bld">Goliath, of Gath.</span>--The Philistine champion belonged to a race or family of giants, the remnant of the sons of Anak (see <a href="/joshua/11-22.htm" title="There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.">Joshua 11:22</a>), who still dwelt in Gath and Gaza and Ashdod. The height mentioned was about nine feet two inches. We have in history a few instances of similar giants. This doughty champion was "full of savage insolence, unable to understand how any one could contend against his brute strength and impregnable panoply; the very type of the stupid 'Philistine,' such as has, in the language of modern Germany, not unfitly identified the name with the opponents of light and freedom and growth."--<span class= "ital">Stanley.</span><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
