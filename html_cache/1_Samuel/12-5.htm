His role as a leader is significant, bridging the period of the judges and the establishment of the monarchy. Samuel's authority is recognized by the Israelites, and his words carry weight as he speaks on behalf of God.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD is a witness against you</b><br>Invoking the LORD as a witness emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. In ancient Israel, God was often called upon as a witness in legal and covenantal contexts, underscoring His omniscience and justice. This phrase indicates that the people are accountable to God for their actions and decisions.<p><b>and His anointed is a witness today</b><br>"His anointed" refers to King Saul, whom Samuel had anointed as the first king of Israel. The anointing signifies Saul's divine appointment and authority. This phrase highlights the dual witness of both divine and earthly authority, reinforcing the legitimacy of the proceedings.<p><b>that you have not found anything in my hand.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel asserts his integrity and innocence, claiming that he has not defrauded or wronged the people. This statement is a defense against any accusations of corruption or misuse of power. It reflects the biblical principle of leaders being above reproach, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>.<p><b>&#8220;He is a witness,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>The people's response acknowledges the truth of Samuel's statement and the validity of the witnesses. This agreement signifies their acceptance of Samuel's leadership and the divine order established through him. It also reflects the communal aspect of covenantal relationships in Israel, where the community collectively affirms and upholds the truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

The phrase &#8220;said to them&#8221; signals that what follows is not private counsel but a public, covenantal declaration meant for every Israelite ear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The LORD is a witness against you&#8221;</b><p>- Calling the LORD as witness elevates the moment to a courtroom scene where God Himself presides (<a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49-53</a>; <a href="/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>).<p>- The expression &#8220;against you&#8221; doesn&#8217;t imply hostility but accountability: if the people later deny Samuel&#8217;s integrity&#8212;or the covenant they are affirming&#8212;God will testify to the truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-28.htm">Deuteronomy 31:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>).<p>- This invocation underlines that truth is objective and recorded before the living God, not subject to later revision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and His anointed is a witness today&#8221;</b><p>- &#8220;His anointed&#8221; refers to King Saul, freshly installed by divine choice (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>).<p>- By naming Saul as witness, Samuel anchors the statement in the new political reality: both prophet and king agree on Samuel&#8217;s blamelessness.<p>- The pattern foreshadows later respect for &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; seen in <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6 and 26</a>:9, reminding the people to honor God&#8217;s chosen leader.<p>- Behind Saul lurks the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s ultimate Anointed (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>), hinting that every earthly king witnesses to God&#8217;s righteous standard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;that you have not found anything in my hand&#8221;</b><p>- &#8220;In my hand&#8221; is a Hebrew idiom for possession or gain; Samuel is declaring that no bribery, extortion, or misuse of power can be laid at his feet (<a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-4</a>).<p>- This mirrors Moses&#8217; own defense, &#8220;I have not taken even a donkey from them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>), and anticipates Paul&#8217;s words, &#8220;I have coveted no one&#8217;s silver or gold or clothing&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>).<p>- Samuel&#8217;s spotless record underscores the principle that God&#8217;s servants must model integrity, leaving the people without excuse when they later fail (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He is a witness,&#8221; they replied</b><p>- The people&#8217;s affirmation functions like a legal seal (<a href="/joshua/24-21.htm">Joshua 24:21-22</a>). By agreeing aloud, they bind themselves to this testimony.<p>- Their response removes any future claim that Samuel wronged them, forcing them to own responsibility for their forthcoming choices under Saul&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>).<p>- This mutual acknowledgment sets a benchmark: leadership can be trusted when it stands clean before God and man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s declaration in <a href="/1_samuel/12-5.htm">1 Samuel 12:5</a> showcases a leader finishing well.
