These men were part of his larger group of six hundred, highlighting the importance of community and shared responsibility within the people of God. This moment underscores the leadership qualities of David, who ensures that all members of his group are accounted for and valued.<p><b>who had been too exhausted to follow him</b><br>The exhaustion of these men reflects the physical and emotional toll of their journey and previous battles. It serves as a reminder of human limitations and the need for rest, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>). This also illustrates the compassion and understanding of David as a leader, recognizing the limitations of his men.<p><b>and who were left behind at the Brook of Besor</b><br>The Brook of Besor is a geographical location that provided a natural resting place. It is situated in the southern part of Judah, near the Negev desert.

This act of coming out to meet them signifies unity and the importance of fellowship among believers, as seen in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p><b>As David approached the men, he greeted them</b><br>David&#8217;s greeting is an act of kindness and inclusion, demonstrating his role as a shepherd-king who cares for all his people, not just the warriors. This reflects the heart of Christ, the Good Shepherd, who knows and cares for His sheep (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).

The singular is supported by all the versions except the Chaldee, and by some MSS. David had made such men as were growing weary halt at the torrent, because it was a fit place where to collect the stragglers, and also, perhaps, because it would have required time and labour to get the baggage across. All the more wicked and worthless (see on 1 Samuel 1:16) members of the force now propose to give the 200, only their wives and children, and send them away with no share of the spoil.
