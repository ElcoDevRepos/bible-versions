This event was precipitated by a severe famine in Canaan, which led Jacob to relocate his family to Egypt, where his son Joseph had risen to power. This move was part of God's providential plan to preserve the Israelites and fulfill His promise to Abraham about making his descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). Egypt, at this time, was a powerful and prosperous nation, providing a fertile ground for the Israelites to grow in number.<p><b>your fathers cried out to the LORD</b><br>The Israelites' cry to the LORD signifies their plea for deliverance from the oppression they faced in Egypt. This is detailed in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>, where the Israelites groaned under slavery and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This cry is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's people call upon Him in times of distress, demonstrating their dependence on His mercy and power.<p><b>and He sent them Moses and Aaron</b><br>God's response to the Israelites' cry was to send Moses and Aaron as deliverers. Moses, raised in Pharaoh's household, was uniquely prepared to confront the Egyptian ruler, while Aaron, his brother, served as his spokesperson. This divine appointment is recorded in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3-4</a>. Moses is a type of Christ, as both are deliverers of God's people&#8212;Moses from physical bondage and Christ from spiritual bondage.<p><b>who brought your fathers out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase highlights the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, where God, through Moses and Aaron, led the Israelites out of Egyptian slavery. The Exodus is a powerful demonstration of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, fulfilling His promise to Abraham. It is also a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who leads believers out of the bondage of sin.<p><b>and settled them in this place</b><br>The "place" refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had sworn to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The settlement in Canaan, as described in the books of Joshua and Judges, represents the fulfillment of God's promises and His faithfulness to His covenant. This settlement is a type of the eternal rest and inheritance believers have in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose migration to Egypt with his family set the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and subsequent exodus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years before God delivered them through Moses and Aaron.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who hears the cries of His people and acts on their behalf.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>The leaders chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage and lead them to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The pivotal event of deliverance where God led the Israelites out of Egypt, symbolizing salvation and freedom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_hears_and_responds.htm">God Hears and Responds</a></b><br>Just as God heard the cries of the Israelites, He hears our prayers today.
