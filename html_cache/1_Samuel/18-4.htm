In ancient Israel, a robe was a symbol of one's status and identity. By giving his robe to David, Jonathan is symbolically transferring his own status as the king's son and heir to David, acknowledging David's future role in God's plan. This act of humility and selflessness is reminiscent of Christ's humility, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, where Jesus "made himself nothing" by taking on the nature of a servant.<p><b>and gave it to David</b><br>The giving of the robe is a covenantal gesture, indicating a bond of loyalty and friendship. In the cultural context of the time, such an act would be seen as a pledge of support and alliance. This covenant between Jonathan and David is a precursor to the New Covenant established by Jesus, highlighting themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and love.<p><b>along with his tunic</b><br>The tunic was an essential garment, worn close to the body. By giving his tunic, Jonathan is offering something personal and intimate, further solidifying the bond between him and David. This act can be seen as a type of Christ's offering of Himself, as He clothes believers in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>his sword</b><br>The sword represents power and protection. By giving his sword to David, Jonathan is entrusting David with his own means of defense and authority. This gesture foreshadows the spiritual armor that believers are called to take up in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where the "sword of the Spirit" is the Word of God.<p><b>his bow</b><br>The bow, a weapon of warfare, symbolizes strength and skill. Jonathan's gift of his bow to David signifies his recognition of David's role as a warrior chosen by God. This act parallels the spiritual battles faced by believers, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where the weapons of warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power.<p><b>and his belt</b><br>The belt was used to secure garments and weapons, symbolizing readiness and preparedness. By giving his belt, Jonathan is equipping David for the challenges ahead. This is akin to the "belt of truth" mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, which is part of the full armor of God that believers are encouraged to wear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his deep friendship with David.

At this point in the account, David is gaining favor in Saul's court and forming a close bond with Jonathan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul's_court.htm">Saul's Court</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where David is serving King Saul after his victory over Goliath.
