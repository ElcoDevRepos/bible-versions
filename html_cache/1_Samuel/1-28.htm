This dedication is significant in the cultural context of ancient Israel, where firstborn sons held special status and were often consecrated to God (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). The act of dedicating Samuel to the LORD also reflects the practice of the Nazirite vow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>), although Samuel's dedication is lifelong and initiated by his mother. This dedication is a profound act of faith and gratitude, acknowledging God's sovereignty and provision.<p><b>For as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD.</b><br>The lifelong dedication of Samuel to the LORD underscores the seriousness and permanence of Hannah's vow. Unlike the temporary Nazirite vow, Samuel's service to God is to be unending, signifying total commitment. This mirrors the concept of being set apart for God's purposes, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God sets Jeremiah apart before birth). Samuel's life becomes a type of Christ, who was also dedicated to God's service from birth and lived a life wholly devoted to fulfilling God's will (<a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>).<p><b>So they worshiped the LORD there.</b><br>The act of worship at the conclusion of the dedication ceremony highlights the centrality of worship in the life of the Israelites. Worship at Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located, was a communal and familial act, reflecting obedience and reverence to God. This moment of worship signifies acknowledgment of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises. It also prefigures the worship of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the object of Christian worship (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>). The communal aspect of worship here points to the importance of corporate worship in the life of believers, as seen in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was initially barren but prayed earnestly for a child.

And they spoiled the Egyptians.">Exodus 12:36</a>, is false. The translation should run: <span class= "ital">"</span>Therefore I also make him one asked of the Lord; all the days that he liveth he is asked of the Lord." The sense is: "The Lord gave him to me, and now I have returned him whom I obtained by prayer to the Lord, as one asked or demanded."<p><span class= "bld">And he worshipped the Lord there.</span>--"He," that is, the boy Samuel: thus putting his own child-seal to his mother's gift of himself to God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have lent him.</span> The word <span class="accented">lent</span> spoils the meaning: Hannah really in these two verses uses the same verb four times, though in different conjugations, and the same sense must be maintained throughout. Her words are, "For this child I prayed, and Jehovah hath given me my <span class="accented">asking</span> which I <span class="accented">asked</span> of him: and I also have <span class="accented">given back what was asked</span> to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is <span class="accented">asked</span> for Jehovah." The conjugation translated <span class="accented">to give back what was asked</span> literally means <span class="accented">to make to ask</span>, and so to give or lend anything asked. The sense here requires the restoration by Hannah of what she had prayed for (comp. <a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35, 36</a>), but which she had asked not for herself, but that she might devote it to Jehovah's service. At the end of ver. 28 the sing. "he worshipped" is rendered in the pl. by all the versions except the Sept., which omits it. But he, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Elkanah, includes all his household, and it may be correctly translated in the pl., because the sense so requires, without altering the reading of the Hebrew. In the sing. it puts an unnecessary difficulty in the way of the ordinary reader. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
