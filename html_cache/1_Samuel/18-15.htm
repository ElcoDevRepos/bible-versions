David's success can be attributed to the Spirit of the Lord being with him, as seen earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13-14</a>, where the Spirit of the Lord departs from Saul and comes upon David. This success is not merely military but also in gaining the favor of the people and Saul's own household, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>. The Hebrew word for "successful" can also imply wisdom and prudence, indicating that David's success was comprehensive, encompassing both his actions and his character.<p><b>he was afraid of him</b><br>Saul's fear of David is rooted in his recognition of the Lord's favor upon David, which he himself has lost. This fear is compounded by Saul's awareness of the prophecy that his kingdom would not endure and that God had sought out a man after His own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). Saul's fear is not just personal but also political, as he sees David as a threat to his throne. This fear leads to Saul's increasing paranoia and attempts to kill David, as seen in the subsequent chapters. Saul's fear contrasts with the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), highlighting Saul's spiritual decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel. Saul's reign was marked by disobedience to God, leading to his eventual rejection as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel. Known for his faithfulness to God, David gained favor and success, which caused Saul to become fearful and jealous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Saul reigned as king. The people of Israel were witnesses to the growing tension between Saul and David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/success_of_david.htm">Success of David</a></b><br>David's success in battle and his growing popularity among the people of Israel were evident signs of God's favor upon him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_saul.htm">Fear of Saul</a></b><br>Saul's fear of David was rooted in jealousy and insecurity, as he recognized the Lord's presence with David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_true_success.htm">The Source of True Success</a></b><br>True success comes from the Lord's presence and favor. David's success was not due to his own abilities but because the Lord was with him. Believers should seek God's presence in their lives as the foundation for true success.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_jealousy_and_fear.htm">The Dangers of Jealousy and Fear</a></b><br>Saul's fear and jealousy of David led to destructive behavior. Jealousy can consume and lead to irrational actions. Christians are called to rejoice with those who rejoice and trust in God's plan for their own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_anointing.htm">Recognizing God's Anointing</a></b><br>Saul's fear was partly due to recognizing God's anointing on David. Believers should be discerning of God's work in others and support rather than oppose those whom God has chosen to bless and use.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trusting in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite Saul's fear and attempts to harm him, David trusted in God's sovereignty and timing.

Earlier, &#8220;Saul eyed David from that day on&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9</a>), a statement that reveals a heart already bent toward comparison. Instead of rejoicing in God&#8217;s work through another, the king keeps score. <a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a> shows a similar pattern when &#8220;his brothers were jealous of him,&#8221; watching Joseph&#8217;s rise with resentment. Observation alone isn&#8217;t sinful&#8212;<a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a> shows Israel&#8217;s spies sent to watch the land&#8212;but what we do with what we see exposes the heart. Saul&#8217;s gaze is shaped by pride, not worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that David was very successful</b><p>David&#8217;s success is repeatedly linked to the LORD&#8217;s presence: &#8220;David continued to prosper in all his ways, for the LORD was with him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>). The text stresses &#8220;very&#8221; successful, underscoring that the victories are unmistakable and public. This echoes <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7&#8211;8</a>, where obedience brings prosperity, and <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous &#8220;prospers in all he does.&#8221; David&#8217;s rise isn&#8217;t luck or charisma; it&#8217;s God-given favor flowing from a heart after God (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). Success that comes from the LORD is meant to point people back to Him, yet Saul&#8217;s focus is horizontal, not vertical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was afraid of him</b><p>Fear replaces celebration. Jealousy feeds insecurity, and insecurity breeds terror. &#8220;Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had departed from Saul&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-12.htm">1 Samuel 18:12</a>). <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> notes, &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion&#8221;. Without God&#8217;s presence, Saul&#8217;s throne feels fragile; David&#8217;s victories feel like threats. Envy always distorts reality&#8212;<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a> warns that &#8220;where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder.&#8221; Perfect love casts out fear (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>), but Saul&#8217;s love for position, not for God, leaves fear unchecked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/18-15.htm">1 Samuel 18:15</a> shows a progression: Saul watches, he recognizes undeniable success granted by God, and his unrepentant heart turns that recognition into fear. David&#8217;s triumphs highlight the LORD&#8217;s faithfulness; Saul&#8217;s reaction highlights the misery of a life detached from God. The verse invites us to celebrate God&#8217;s work in others, rest in His sovereignty, and guard our hearts from envy that robs joy and multiplies fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
