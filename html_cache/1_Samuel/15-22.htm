His role is crucial in guiding Israel during a time of transition from judges to monarchy. Samuel's declarations often carry divine weight, as seen in his anointing of kings and his role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to His voice?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the Israelites' understanding of worship. In the ancient Near East, sacrifices were a common religious practice, but God emphasizes that ritual without obedience is meaningless. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a> and <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>, where God prioritizes mercy and justice over ritualistic offerings.<p><b>Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice,</b><br>Obedience to God's commands is paramount, surpassing the value of ritual sacrifices. This principle is foundational in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where adherence to God's law is a sign of faithfulness. Jesus Christ exemplifies perfect obedience, fulfilling the law and the prophets, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<p><b>and attentiveness is better than the fat of rams.</b><br>Attentiveness, or heeding God's word, is more valuable than the choicest parts of sacrificial animals. The "fat of rams" symbolizes the best offerings one could give, yet God desires a heart that listens and responds to His will.

Instead of joining the festivities, the prophet confronts the king. His opening words are not casual; they carry heaven&#8217;s verdict. Just as Nathan would later tell David, &#8220;You are the man&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), Samuel begins by speaking for the LORD with unquestioned authority (see also <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a>). The moment reminds us that when God&#8217;s servant speaks God&#8217;s Word, we are obligated to listen&#8212;whether or not it suits our plans.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to His voice?</b><p>The question pierces Saul&#8217;s rationalization. He had blamed his soldiers (<a href="/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a>) and claimed that the captured livestock were intended for worship. Yet Scripture consistently shows that rites without righteousness repel God. <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4-7</a> contrasts acceptable and unacceptable offerings; <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a> says, &#8220;You do not delight in sacrifice&#8230; the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.&#8221; Even Jesus echoed this principle, quoting <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;I desire mercy, not sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>). Whenever worship ceremonies become substitutes for surrendered hearts, they grieve the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s key point is breathtakingly simple: God values submission over symbolism.<p>&#8226; Obedience acknowledges God&#8217;s right to rule (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; It proves faith is genuine (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; It opens the channel for blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>; <a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p>Saul&#8217;s partial compliance&#8212;sparing Agag and the best livestock&#8212;was, in reality, outright rebellion (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). The LORD had issued an explicit command (verse 3); anything less than full compliance was disobedience. <a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a> summarizes the lesson: &#8220;To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Attentiveness is better than the fat of rams</b><p>&#8220;Attentiveness&#8221; points to an eager, careful listening that aims to obey (compare <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>, &#8220;We will do and obey&#8221;). In <a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>, the &#8220;fat of rams&#8221; represented the choicest portion given back to God, yet God here says that He would rather have a listening ear. <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;This is the one I will esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at My word.&#8221; Listening precedes doing; without it, even the richest sacrifice is empty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> teaches that God wants hearts that listen and lives that obey more than any outward ritual. Sacrifice matters only when it flows from surrendered obedience. Saul lost his kingdom because he tried to trade partial compliance and public ceremony for wholehearted submission. The lesson endures: the LORD delights in believers who hear His voice and immediately, fully, gladly do what He says.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.</span>--In this answer it would seem that the Spirit of the Lord descended upon Samuel, and that he here gave utterance to one of those rapt expressions which now and again in the course of each of these Hebrew prophets' lives these famous men were commissioned by the Divine power to give out to their fellows. The words of Samuel here were reproduced, or at least referred to, by other prophets and teachers of the old dispensation; for example, see <a href="/context/psalms/50-8.htm" title="I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.">Psalm 50:8-14</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>. Our Lord himself, in His words recorded in Matt. ix, 13, if not actually referring to this passage, makes substantially the same declaration. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - The rebuke of Samuel contains one of those pregnant sayings which mark the high moral tone of the teaching of the prophets, and soon became a fundamental principle with them. <span class="cmt_word">To obey is better than sacrifice</span> is a dictum reproduced by Hosea (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), the most ancient of those prophets of Israel whose lessons have been preserved in writing; it is referred to in still earlier psalms (see <a href="/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16, 17</a>); by other prophets (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6, 8</a>); and finally received our Lord's special approbation (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It asserts in the clearest terms the superiority of moral to ritual worship, and that God can only be really served with the heart. <span class="cmt_word">Witchcraft</span> is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">divination</span>, a sin always strongly condemned in the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Iniquity</span> literally means <span class="accented">nothingness</span>, and so is constantly used for "an idol;" and this must be its signification here, as the word coupled with it, and rendered <span class="cmt_word">idolatry</span>, is really <span class="accented">teraphim.</span> These were the Hebrew household gods, answering to the Roman <span class="accented">Lares</span>, and were supposed to bring good luck. Their worship, we see from this place, was strictly forbidden. The verse, therefore, means, "For rebellion is the sin of divination (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is equal to it in wickedness), and obstinacy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> intractableness) is an idol and teraphim." Samuel thus accuses Saul of resistance to Jehovah's will, and of the determination at all hazards to be his own master. With this temper of mind he could be no fit representative of Jehovah, and therefore Samuel dethrones him.
