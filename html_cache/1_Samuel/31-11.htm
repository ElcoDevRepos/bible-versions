It is significant in Israel's history, particularly in the narrative of Saul. The people of Jabesh-gilead had a special connection to Saul because he had previously rescued them from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11). This act of deliverance created a bond of loyalty and gratitude towards Saul, which is evident in their later actions. The city&#8217;s location in Gilead, a region known for its balm and healing properties, may symbolically reflect the healing and restoration they sought to bring to Saul&#8217;s legacy.<p><b>heard what the Philistines had done to Saul</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during the time of Saul. They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, including iron chariots. The Philistines' actions against Saul included not only defeating him in battle but also desecrating his body, which was a common practice in ancient warfare to humiliate the enemy and assert dominance. This act was particularly grievous to the Israelites, as it was seen as a dishonor not only to Saul but to the nation of Israel and their God. The news of Saul's defeat and the subsequent treatment of his body would have been a source of deep mourning and outrage for the people of Jabesh-gilead, prompting them to take action.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_jabesh-gilead.htm">People of Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>Residents of a city in Gilead, east of the Jordan River.
