The unity of Israel in hearing the news reflects the communal nature of the society and the importance of national events. This also sets the stage for the collective response of the people, emphasizing the significance of the event.<p><b>&#8220;Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines:</b><br>Saul's attack on a Philistine outpost marks a significant military action, as the Philistines were a dominant force in the region. This reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a recurring theme in the books of Samuel. The Philistines were known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, which posed a significant threat to Israel. Saul's action can be seen as an assertion of Israelite strength and a challenge to Philistine dominance.<p><b>and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "a stench to the Philistines" indicates deep animosity and the provocation caused by Saul's actions. This metaphor suggests that Israel's actions were offensive and intolerable to the Philistines, likely leading to increased hostilities. This tension foreshadows the ensuing battles and the Philistines' desire for retribution, setting the stage for future conflicts.<p><b>Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</b><br>Gilgal holds historical and religious significance as a gathering place for Israel. It was the site of important events, such as the renewal of the covenant under Joshua. Saul summoning the people to Gilgal indicates a call to arms and a rallying point for the nation. This gathering reflects the need for unity and preparation for the impending conflict with the Philistines.

The expression "smitten" implies that the garrison in question had been utterly routed, probably put to the sword. The intense hatred with which the Philistines hated the Hebrews is often brought forward. From the first conquest by Joshua they regarded them as interlopers and intruders; between the two peoples there was ceaseless warfare, until the Philistines were completely subdued by the greater Hebrew kings. Naturally, such a deed as that of Jonathan's would at once arouse Philistia.<p><span class= "bld">And the people were called together.</span>--Gradually round the King of Israel the fighting men of the nation in great numbers were gathered. This seems to have been by no means a "levee en masse" of all the people; they seem to have come together very slowly, and very quickly again to have dispersed. The hour for a decisive blow was not yet come. Something, as we shall soon see, prevented Saul, with all his gallantry and splendid military skill, from winning popular confidence.
