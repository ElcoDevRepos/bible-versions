The concept of a circuit implies a predetermined route, reflecting the organized nature of Samuel's ministry. This practice ensured that justice and spiritual guidance were accessible to all Israelites, not just those near a central location. It highlights the importance of consistent spiritual oversight and accountability.<p><b>from Bethel</b><br>Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant religious site in Israel's history. It was where Jacob had his vision of the ladder reaching to heaven (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). By including Bethel in his circuit, Samuel connected his leadership to the patriarchal heritage and the divine promises associated with this location. Bethel's historical and spiritual significance would have reinforced Samuel's authority and the continuity of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>to Gilgal</b><br>Gilgal was the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was a place of renewal and commitment, where the Israelites celebrated the Passover and circumcised the new generation (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2-12</a>). Samuel's inclusion of Gilgal in his circuit underscores the theme of renewal and obedience to God's commands. It also served as a reminder of God's faithfulness in delivering Israel and the need for the people to remain faithful in return.<p><b>to Mizpah</b><br>Mizpah was a significant gathering place for Israel, often associated with national repentance and renewal (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>). It was here that Samuel led the people in repentance and prayer, resulting in a victory over the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7-11</a>). Mizpah's inclusion in the circuit highlights the importance of communal repentance and seeking God's guidance. It also emphasizes Samuel's role as a spiritual leader who facilitated Israel's return to God.<p><b>judging Israel in all these places</b><br>Samuel's role as a judge involved more than legal decisions; it included spiritual leadership and guidance. His judgments were based on God's law, ensuring that justice was administered according to divine standards. This phrase reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where spiritual and civil leadership were intertwined. Samuel's circuit ensured that all regions of Israel received equal attention and guidance, promoting unity and adherence to God's covenant. His role as judge prefigures Christ as the ultimate judge and king, who will one day rule with perfect justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel played a crucial role in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

This leads us to the conclusion that the power of Samuel, if not exclusively, was chiefly exercised among the southern tribes. The whole subsequent story of the chosen people seems to tell us that the religion of the Eternal at an early date became corrupted m the north of the Promised Land, and that the restoration of faith and purification of life--the result of the great work of Samuel--was so much less marked in the northern than in the southern tribes, that when the strong hand of Solomon was removed, a formal secession from the southern league at once took place. This was followed by a rapid deterioration both in faith and practice in the northern kingdom of Israel.<p>The places mentioned as the centres where Samuel "judged" were all holy sites, and at different periods of the year, no doubt, were crowded with pilgrims from distant parts of the land.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Every year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he would go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;la&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
