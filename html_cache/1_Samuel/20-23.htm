The context is a covenant of friendship and loyalty, highlighting the deep bond between the two. This covenant is significant in the narrative of David's rise to kingship and the preservation of his life. The discussion involves a plan to discern Saul's intentions, showcasing the political intrigue and danger David faced.<p><b>the LORD is a witness</b><br>Invoking the LORD as a witness underscores the solemnity and sacredness of their agreement. In ancient Israel, invoking God as a witness was a way to ensure truthfulness and accountability, as God was seen as the ultimate judge and overseer of human actions. This reflects the deep faith and reliance on God that both David and Jonathan shared, and it emphasizes the spiritual dimension of their covenant.<p><b>between you and me</b><br>The personal nature of this covenant is highlighted here. It is not just a political alliance but a personal commitment between two individuals. This reflects the biblical theme of covenant relationships, which are central to the narrative of the Bible, from God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, and Moses, to the New Covenant through Jesus Christ.<p><b>forever</b><br>The use of "forever" indicates the enduring nature of their covenant, suggesting that it transcends their immediate circumstances and has lasting implications. This can be seen as a type of the eternal covenant God makes with His people, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The eternal aspect of their agreement also foreshadows the enduring legacy of David's line, which is ultimately fulfilled in the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.
