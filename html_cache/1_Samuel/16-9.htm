Shammah is the third son of Jesse. The presentation of Jesse's sons is a significant event, as it is part of God's plan to anoint a new king over Israel. Shammah, like his brothers, is a part of the tribe of Judah, which holds importance as the tribe from which the Messiah is prophesied to come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). The act of presenting each son indicates the cultural practice of seeking divine approval for leadership roles, emphasizing the importance of God's choice over human preference.<p><b>but Samuel said</b><br>Samuel, the last judge of Israel and a prophet, is acting under God's direction. His role is crucial as he is tasked with anointing the future king. Samuel's discernment is guided by God, highlighting the theme of divine guidance in leadership selection. This moment underscores the importance of obedience to God's will, as Samuel does not rely on outward appearances or personal judgment but waits for God's confirmation.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has not chosen this one either.&#8221;</b><br>The rejection of Shammah, like his brothers before him, emphasizes that God's criteria for leadership differ from human expectations. This statement reflects the broader biblical theme that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also foreshadows the selection of David, the youngest and seemingly least likely candidate, illustrating God's sovereign choice and the unexpected ways He fulfills His purposes. This moment is a reminder of God's omniscience and His ability to see beyond human limitations, choosing those who align with His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David and his brothers, a Bethlehemite, who presents his sons to the prophet Samuel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shammah.htm">Shammah</a></b><br>One of Jesse's sons, presented to Samuel as a potential king, but not chosen by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet of God, tasked with anointing the next king of Israel after Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The town where Jesse and his family reside, and where Samuel goes to anoint the new king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who guides Samuel in choosing the next king of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_criteria_for_leadership.htm">God's Criteria for Leadership</a></b><br>God looks beyond outward appearances and evaluates the heart.

Jesse is methodically parading his sons before the prophet, moving from the eldest downward (<a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Shammah, the third son (<a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>), would have been viewed in the family as another strong candidate&#8212;mature, battle-ready, and from a respected lineage in Bethlehem (<a href="/ruth/4-17.htm">Ruth 4:17, 22</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence reminds us that God is allowing every natural option to be exhausted before revealing His unexpected choice, echoing earlier patterns where human strength is bypassed for divine purposes (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Samuel said</b><p>&#8226; Samuel acts as God&#8217;s mouthpiece, refusing to rely on personal impressions (contrast <a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a> with v. 7).<p>&#8226; His pause and response demonstrate disciplined obedience; he will not anoint anyone unless the Lord signals approval (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment teaches discernment: even trusted leaders must wait for God&#8217;s confirmation rather than hastily endorsing promising prospects (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>;

<a href="/luke/16-15.htm">Luke 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Shammah is not condemned; he simply is not selected for this specific calling.
