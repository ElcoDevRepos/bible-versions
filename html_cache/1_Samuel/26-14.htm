This scene takes place in the Wilderness of Ziph, a region known for its rugged terrain, which provided David with strategic hiding places. David's shout signifies his boldness and confidence, even when facing the king's army. Abner, the son of Ner, is Saul's cousin and the commander of his army, highlighting the close-knit nature of Saul's inner circle. This moment underscores the tension between David and Saul's forces, as David directly addresses the military leader.<p><b>&#8220;Will you not answer me, Abner?&#8221;</b><br>David's question is a challenge to Abner's vigilance and loyalty. By addressing Abner directly, David is questioning the competence of Saul's military leadership. This reflects the broader theme of divine protection over David, as he is able to infiltrate the camp undetected. The question also serves to highlight Abner's failure to protect the king, which is a significant breach of duty in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Who are you who calls to the king?&#8221; Abner replied.</b><br>Abner's response indicates surprise and perhaps embarrassment at being caught off guard. His question reflects the hierarchical structure of the time, where addressing the king required authority or permission. This exchange foreshadows the eventual transfer of power from Saul to David, as it demonstrates David's growing influence and the weakening of Saul's reign. The interaction also points to the theme of recognition, as David is not yet fully acknowledged as the rightful king, despite his anointing by Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.
