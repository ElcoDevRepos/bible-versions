This group of men had gathered around David as he fled from King Saul, who sought his life. The loyalty of these men is significant, as they saw David as their leader and future king, despite his current status as a fugitive.<p><b>&#8220;This is the day about which the LORD said to you</b><br>The men believed that this moment was divinely appointed, suggesting that God had previously revealed to David that he would have an opportunity to confront his enemy. This reflects a common belief in divine providence and the fulfillment of God's promises, though there is no specific recorded prophecy in the text where God explicitly states this to David.<p><b>&#8216;Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand</b><br>The phrase indicates a belief in God's sovereignty and control over events. The men interpreted Saul's vulnerable position as a sign that God had delivered him into David's hands. This reflects the biblical theme of God orchestrating events for His purposes, as seen in other scriptures where God delivers enemies into the hands of His chosen people (e.g., <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>).<p><b>that you may do with him as you wish.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>David's men assumed that God was giving David the freedom to act against Saul, possibly to kill him and end his pursuit. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice where a king or leader would eliminate threats to secure their position. However, David's subsequent actions demonstrate his restraint and respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed.<p><b>Then David crept up and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe.</b><br>David's action of cutting off a corner of Saul's robe was symbolic. In ancient Israel, a robe represented authority and identity. By cutting Saul's robe, David demonstrated that he could have harmed Saul but chose not to. This act of restraint highlights David's respect for God's anointed king and his trust in God's timing for his own ascension to the throne. It also foreshadows the eventual transfer of kingship from Saul to David, as the robe is a symbol of royal authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_david.htm">The Men of David</a></b><br>Loyal followers and warriors who support David during his time of exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cave.htm">The Cave</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness of En Gedi where David and his men are hiding when Saul enters.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who has anointed David as the future king and is sovereign over the events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_authority.htm">Respect for Authority</a></b><br>David's refusal to harm Saul, despite the opportunity, teaches us to respect those in authority, recognizing God's sovereignty in their appointment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>David's patience and trust in God's promise remind us to wait on the Lord's timing rather than taking matters into our own hands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_adversity.htm">Integrity in Adversity</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate integrity and faithfulness to God's commands, even when pressured by others to act otherwise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_restraint.htm">The Power of Restraint</a></b><br>Exercising restraint and mercy, as David did, can be a powerful testimony of faith and obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>This passage highlights God's control over circumstances and His ability to fulfill His promises in His own time and way.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_24_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 24:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_restraint_shows_godly_leadership.htm">How does David's restraint in 1 Samuel 24:4 demonstrate godly leadership qualities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/David_s_lesson_on_revenge_response.htm">What does David's decision teach about responding to opportunities for revenge?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_4_Jesus_Love_enemies_link.htm">How does 1 Samuel 24:4 connect with Jesus' teachings on loving enemies?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_David_on_trusting_God_s_timing.htm">What can we learn from David about trusting God's timing for justice?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_David_s_mercy_in_conflicts.htm">How can we apply David's example of mercy in our daily conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_spare_Saul_s_life.htm">Why did David spare Saul's life in 1 Samuel 24:4 despite having the opportunity to kill him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_24_4_Divine_providence_restraint.htm">How does 1 Samuel 24:4 illustrate the concept of divine providence and restraint?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/David_s_lesson_on_forgiveness_mercy.htm">What does David's action in 1 Samuel 24:4 teach about forgiveness and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_cutting_saul's_robe_prove_innocence.htm">How does David&#8217;s act of cutting Saul&#8217;s robe (1 Samuel 24:4&#8211;5) reliably prove his innocence when no neutral witnesses are mentioned? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/proof_of_divine_intervention_in_psalm_138_7.htm">Psalm 138:7 promises deliverance in the midst of trouble.
