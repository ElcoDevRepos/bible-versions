Gath was one of the five Philistine cities, and David had previously sought refuge there, pretending to be insane to avoid suspicion (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>). This highlights David's precarious situation, caught between his own people and their enemies. His departure signifies a turning point, moving from a place of potential danger to a place of solitude and reflection.<p><b>and took refuge in the cave of Adullam.</b><br>The cave of Adullam is located in the Judean wilderness, providing a natural fortress and a place of safety. This location is significant as it becomes a gathering place for those who are discontented or in distress, forming the core of David's future army (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>). The cave symbolizes a place of transformation and preparation, much like the wilderness experiences of other biblical figures such as Moses and Elijah. It also foreshadows Christ's own times of solitude and prayer in the wilderness.<p><b>When his brothers and the rest of his father&#8217;s household heard about it,</b><br>David's family, aware of his plight and the threat from Saul, seeks to join him. This reflects the strong familial bonds and loyalty within David's family, despite earlier tensions, such as those seen during his anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6-13</a>). Their decision to join David indicates a shift in allegiance and support, recognizing David's anointed role and the danger posed by Saul.<p><b>they went down to him there.</b><br>The phrase "went down" not only describes the physical descent to the cave but also signifies a movement towards David's leadership and protection. This act of joining David in Adullam is a step of faith and solidarity, aligning themselves with God's chosen king. It mirrors the gathering of believers to Christ, who offers refuge and leadership to those who follow Him. The gathering at Adullam sets the stage for the formation of a community that will support David throughout his rise to kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to protect His anointed, to provide sanctuary, and to gather a people who will share in His unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The cave Adullam.</span>--The great valley of Elah forms the highway from Philistia to Hebron. In one especially of the tributary vales or ravines of the Elah valley are many natural caves, some of great extent, roomy and dry, which are still used by the shepherds as dwelling-places, and as refuges for their flocks and herds. David chose one of these natural fastnesses as the temporary home for himself and his followers. The traveller sees that there was ample room for the 400 refugees who gathered under David's skilled leadership. Stanley even speaks of this Adullam Cavern as "a subterranean palace, with vast columnar halls and arched chambers."<p>The name Adullam was probably given to the largest of these great caverns from its proximity to the old royal Canaanitish city of Adullam (<a href="/joshua/15-35.htm" title="Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,">Joshua 15:35</a>), ruins of which on a rounded hill to the south of the cave are still visible.<p><span class= "bld">His brethren and all his father's house.</span>--They of course soon felt the weight of Saul's anger against the prominent hero of their race, and dreading the fate which often overwhelms whole families for the faults of one of the more distinguished members, fled from their homes, and joined David and his armed force of outlaws.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cave Adullam.</span> According to Josephus this was situated near a city of the same name ('Ant.,' 6:12, 3), which formed one of a group of fifteen in the Shephelah (see on 1 Samuel 17:1), and its site has now been recovered by Mr. Conder (see 'Tent Work,' 2:156-160). "The great valley," he says, "of Elah, which forms the highway from Philistia to Hebron, runs down northwards past Keilah and Hareth, dividing the low hills of the Shephelah from the rocky mountains of Judah. Eight miles from the valley head stands Shochoh,... and two and a half miles south of this is a very large and ancient terebinth." This stands on "the west side of the vale, just where a small tributary ravine joins the main valley; and on the south of this ravine is a high rounded hill, almost isolated by valleys, and covered with ruins, a natural fortress," the site of the city Adullam. David's cave, he considers, would not be one of the larger caverns, as these are seldom used for habitations; but "the sides of the tributary valley are lined with rows of caves, and these we found inhabited, and full of flocks and herds; but still more interesting was the discovery of a separate cave on the hill itself, a low, smoke-blackened burrow, which was the home of a single family. We could not but suppose, as we entered this gloomy abode, that our feet were standing in the very footprints of the shepherd king, who here, encamped between the Philistines and the Jews, covered the line of advance on the cornfields of Keilah, and was but three miles distant from the thickets of Hareth." After describing the fine view from this hill, which is about 500 feet high, he adds, "There is ample room to have accommodated David's 400 men in the caves, and they are, as we have seen, still inhabited." Thus then David's cave was one of many in the Terebinth valley and the ravine opening into it, and was not far from Gath, though over the border. Here <span class="cmt_word">his brethren and all his father's house</span> joined him through fear of Saul. Among these would be Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, his cousins; and we learn how great was the love and enthusiasm which David was able to inspire among them from the feat of the three heroes, of whom Abishai was one, who, while he was in the cave of Adullam, and a garrison of the Philistines at Bethlehem, broke through them to bring David water from the well there (<a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13-17</a>). As Bethlehem was thus held by the Philistines, there was double reason for the flight of Jesse's family; and it is a proof how thoroughly Saul's government had broken down that, while Samuel could maintain a son at Beersheba as judge (1 Samuel 8:24 Saul was unable to defend places so much more distant from the Philistine border. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
