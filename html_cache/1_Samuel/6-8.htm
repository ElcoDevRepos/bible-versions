It contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna. The Philistines had captured the Ark in battle, but it brought them plagues, demonstrating God's power and holiness. The return of the Ark signifies God's sovereignty and the Philistines' acknowledgment of His might.<p><b>set it on the cart</b><br>The use of a cart to transport the Ark was contrary to the instructions given to the Israelites, who were commanded to carry it on poles by the Levites (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). This method reflects the Philistines' lack of understanding of the proper reverence and procedures for handling sacred objects. It also foreshadows later events when the Israelites themselves would mishandle the Ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3-7</a>).<p><b>and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to Him as a guilt offering</b><br>The gold objects, shaped as tumors and rats, were crafted as a guilt offering to acknowledge the plagues that had afflicted the Philistines. This act of sending a guilt offering reflects an ancient Near Eastern practice of appeasing deities. It also highlights the Philistines' recognition of the God of Israel's power, even if their understanding was incomplete.<p><b>Then send the ark on its way</b><br>This directive to send the Ark back to Israel without human guidance was a test to determine if the plagues were indeed from the God of Israel. The Philistines' decision to let the cows lead the cart without guidance was meant to see if the Ark would return to Israel on its own, thus confirming divine intervention. This event underscores God's control over all creation and His ability to direct events according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_lord.htm">The Ark of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The people who captured the Ark and experienced plagues as a result, prompting them to return it to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering.htm">Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering made to atone for sin or guilt, in this case, represented by gold objects.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cart.htm">Cart</a></b><br>A vehicle used by the Philistines to transport the Ark back to Israel, symbolizing their desire to rid themselves of the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-shemesh.htm">Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>The destination where the Ark was sent, a Levitical city in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The Ark symbolizes God's presence.
