It was the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). This location was a place of renewal and covenant, where the Israelites reaffirmed their commitment to God. The gathering at Gilgal for Saul's confirmation as king underscores its role as a site for national unity and spiritual dedication.<p><b>and confirmed Saul as king</b><br>This event marks the formal recognition of Saul's kingship by the people of Israel. Although Saul had been anointed by Samuel earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), this public confirmation solidified his role as the leader. The act of confirmation by the people highlights the importance of communal acceptance and support for leadership in Israel. It also reflects the transition from a theocratic system led by judges to a monarchy.<p><b>in the presence of the LORD</b><br>The phrase emphasizes that the confirmation of Saul's kingship was not merely a political act but a spiritual one, conducted with divine oversight. The presence of the LORD signifies His approval and blessing on the proceedings. This aligns with the biblical principle that true leadership is established under God's authority and guidance.<p><b>There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD</b><br>Peace offerings, or fellowship offerings, were a type of sacrifice in the Old Testament that symbolized reconciliation and thanksgiving to God (Leviticus 3). By offering these sacrifices, the Israelites expressed gratitude and sought to maintain a harmonious relationship with God. This act of worship at Saul's confirmation signifies the desire for divine favor and peace under his reign.<p><b>and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly</b><br>The great rejoicing indicates the collective relief and joy of the Israelites in having a king to lead them, especially after the recent victory over the Ammonites (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>). This joy reflects the hope and optimism for a united and prosperous future under Saul's leadership. It also underscores the communal aspect of Israel's identity, where national events were celebrated together in the context of worship and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Gilgal lay just inside the Promised Land, a symbolic spot for fresh starts&#8212;Joshua first set up memorial stones there, and Samuel often met the nation there (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; 13:4&#8211;8).<p>&#8226; By choosing Gilgal, Samuel invites Israel to recall past covenant faithfulness and to renew it under their new king, linking present obedience to earlier deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD</b><p>The people had already acclaimed Saul at Mizpah (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>), yet this &#8220;confirmation&#8221; completes the process:<p>&#8226; Public ratification&#8212;elders and ordinary Israelites alike acknowledge Saul&#8217;s God-given role, echoing later confirmations of David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the presence of the LORD&#8221; reminds everyone that kingship is not merely political; it is accountable to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s leadership in calling for this ceremony (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>) underscores prophetic oversight of the monarchy, anchoring royal authority in divine appointment rather than popular opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD</b><p>Peace (or fellowship) offerings were celebrations of restored relationship and shared meals with God (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>;

By sacrificing &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; Israel acknowledges that every military triumph and political development flows from His grace, not human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly</b><p>The day ends in overflowing gladness, much like earlier covenant celebrations (<a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>;

National rejoicing fulfills God&#8217;s desire that His people delight in His gifts (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene previews the ideal pattern for leadership: victory attributed to God, covenant renewed, worship offered, and joy shared (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a> captures a pivotal moment when Israel gathers at Gilgal, renews covenant loyalty, publicly recognizes Saul&#8217;s God-ordained kingship, worships through peace offerings, and erupts in shared joy. The verse teaches that true leadership and national success stand on unity under God&#8217;s authority, grateful worship, and heartfelt rejoicing in His faithful provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal.</span>--We must not understand with the LXX. Version that Saul was anointed afresh at Gilgal. The Greek Version reads, "and Samuel anointed Saul king there." The Gilgal convention was nothing more than a solemn national confirmation of the popular election at Mizpeh. The words "before the Lord," imply the presence of the Ark, or of the high priest with the mystic Urim and Thummim. Bishop Wordsworth understands the words "they made Saul king" to signify that after this "the people would not allow him any longer to lead a private life, but they made him to assume the royal state and authority to which he had been appointed by God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They made Saul king.</span> This is not to be interpreted, with the Septuagint, of a second anointing of Saul, but of his confirmation in the kingdom by the unanimous voice of the nation, whereas the first election of him at Mizpah had met with opposition. <span class="cmt_word">Before Jehovah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> with religious ceremonies conducted by Samuel and the high priest. The difference between Saul's election at Mizpah and the confirmation of it at Gilgal is much the same as between the first proclamation or' a king and his coronation. The latter is the nation's acknowledgment of his sovereignty, and the solemn consecration of him to his high office. <span class="cmt_word">Peace offerings</span> were tokens of joy and gratitude, and were followed by a feast. At this there was great rejoicing, because the king whom they had desired had so quickly proved himself worthy to be their head. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
