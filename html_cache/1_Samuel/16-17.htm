This command reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where the king's word was law. Saul's reliance on his servants indicates the centralized power and the role of servants in the royal court. This moment occurs after the Spirit of the Lord has departed from Saul, highlighting his increasing dependence on human solutions to his spiritual and emotional turmoil.<p><b>Find me someone who plays well</b><br>Music played a significant role in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often used for worship, celebration, and soothing purposes. Saul's request for a skilled musician suggests an understanding of music's therapeutic effects, which were recognized even in ancient times. This request foreshadows the introduction of David, who is not only a skilled musician but also the future king of Israel. The emphasis on finding someone who "plays well" underscores the importance of excellence and skill in service to the king, a principle that can be applied to serving God with our best abilities.<p><b>and bring him to me</b><br>This phrase indicates Saul's desire for immediate relief from his distress, which was caused by an evil spirit from the Lord. The act of bringing someone to the king's presence signifies the importance of personal service and the intimate role that David would soon play in Saul's life. This moment sets the stage for David's entrance into the royal court, where he would gain experience and insight into kingship. It also prefigures the way Jesus Christ would be brought into the world to provide spiritual relief and salvation, as David's presence would bring temporary relief to Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Earlier, &#8220;the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>), so the king feels restless and uneasy.<p>&#8226; Instead of seeking God directly (contrast <a href="/1_samuel/14-37.htm">1 Samuel 14:37</a>, where he once asked the LORD), he turns to human help&#8212;his household staff.<p>&#8226; Leadership always influences others. Saul&#8217;s command sets in motion events that will introduce David to the royal court, echoing <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>: &#8220;A king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Compare the reliance on attendants here with <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, where Adonijah also enlists servants for his own agenda. Both scenes remind us that authority can be used for self-serving or God-ordained purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Find me someone who plays well</b><p>&#8226; Saul asks for skill, not merely noise. Skillful worship mattered in Israel (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Music was recognized as calming. Elisha once said, &#8220;Now bring me a harpist&#8221; before prophesying (<a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). Saul hopes for the same soothing effect.<p>&#8226; God providentially weaves David&#8217;s musical gifting (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>) into His larger plan. What looks like a desperate search for relief becomes a divine appointment.<p>&#8226; The need for &#8220;someone who plays well&#8221; hints that God values excellence in the arts when used for His purposes (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> applied today).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bring him to me</b><p>&#8226; The command is urgent; Saul&#8217;s torment pushes him to act quickly. In God&#8217;s design, this summons will place the future king right beside the present one (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates David&#8217;s journey from obscurity to palace life&#8212;just as Joseph moved from prison to Pharaoh&#8217;s court (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By requiring David&#8217;s physical presence, Saul unknowingly invites the anointed successor into daily proximity, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>: &#8220;It is God who judges: He brings one down, He exalts another.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows Christ, who was &#8220;sent&#8221; into the world (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>) to bring deliverance, showing how God often sends a person to meet a need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/16-17.htm">1 Samuel 16:17</a> captures a pivotal moment: Saul, troubled and distant from God, orders his servants to locate a skilled musician and bring him to court. In providence, that musician will be David. The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s reliance on human solutions rather than repentance.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s use of ordinary gifts&#8212;music&#8212;to accomplish extraordinary purposes.<p>&#8226; A sovereign setup introducing David to royal service, paving the way for Israel&#8217;s next king.<p>Though Saul seeks relief, God is orchestrating redemption history, proving He governs even the requests of restless kings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
