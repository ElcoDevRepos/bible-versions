This city holds historical significance as it was the site of the infamous incident involving the Levite's concubine in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>, which led to a civil war in Israel. Saul's return to Gibeah signifies a return to his roots and a place where he would begin his reign as Israel's first king. The choice of Gibeah as Saul's base highlights the tribal dynamics of Israel, as Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin, a smaller tribe that had previously been decimated in the civil conflict. This return also marks the beginning of Saul's transition from a private citizen to a public leader, emphasizing the personal and communal aspects of his new role.<p><b>and the men of valor</b><br>The "men of valor" refers to warriors or mighty men, indicating that Saul was accompanied by a group of strong and capable individuals. This phrase suggests that Saul's leadership was initially supported by those who were courageous and ready to defend Israel. In the context of ancient Israel, having a group of valiant men was crucial for a leader, especially in a time when the nation was surrounded by hostile neighbors. These men likely served as Saul's initial military support, providing him with the necessary strength to establish his rule and protect the nation.<p><b>whose hearts God had touched</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention in the selection and support of Saul's followers. The touching of hearts by God suggests a spiritual awakening or divine influence that compelled these men to align themselves with Saul. This divine action underscores the theological theme that God is actively involved in the affairs of Israel, guiding and directing the hearts of individuals to fulfill His purposes. It also reflects the biblical principle that true leadership and support come from God's sovereign will, as seen in other scriptures where God influences the hearts of people, such as in <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a>, where God stirs the hearts of the Israelites to contribute to the building of the Tabernacle.<p><b>went with him</b><br>The act of going with Saul signifies loyalty and commitment to his leadership. This movement from their own homes to accompany Saul represents a shift in allegiance and the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's history under a monarchy. It also foreshadows the challenges and responsibilities that Saul would face as king, requiring the support and unity of his followers. This phrase highlights the importance of community and collective action in the establishment of leadership, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative, where leaders are often supported by a faithful remnant or group.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This return to ordinary life shows humility and trust that God will open doors in His timing.<p>&#8226; Gibeah, a Benjamite town (<a href="/judges/19-14.htm">Judges 19:14-15</a>), positions Saul near the future site of his first military test against the Ammonites (<a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4-11</a>). God is quietly placing His king where he will soon be needed.<p>&#8226; Like Moses returning to Midian after his burning-bush encounter (<a href="/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18-20</a>), Saul&#8217;s homecoming underlines that a divine call often begins in familiar surroundings before it moves to public action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the men of valor</b><p>&#8226; The phrase describes courageous, battle-ready men&#8212;Israel&#8217;s equivalent of elite warriors (cf. <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence signals that God is equipping Saul with the human resources necessary for kingship. Leadership in Scripture is rarely a solo endeavor (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-16.htm">Nehemiah 4:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Valiant companions foreshadow the later &#8220;valiant men&#8221; who gather around David (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>), hinting at the recurring pattern of God surrounding His chosen leaders with loyal fighters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose hearts God had touched</b><p>&#8226; Scripture stresses that these men are moved by God, not merely by Saul&#8217;s charisma. As with Ezra&#8217;s return from exile (&#8220;everyone whose spirit God had stirred,&#8221; <a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>) and Lydia&#8217;s conversion (&#8220;the Lord opened her heart,&#8221; <a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>), the Lord is the decisive influencer.<p>&#8226; Their devotion flows from divine initiative: &#8220;for it is God who works in you to will and to act&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>). True allegiance to God&#8217;s appointed leader begins with a work of grace in the heart.<p>&#8226; This touch also rebuts any claim that the new monarchy rests on human politics; it rests on God&#8217;s sovereign preparation (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went with him</b><p>&#8226; The phrase completes the picture: the king is not alone; God-moved warriors physically accompany him back to Gibeah. Presence matters&#8212;just as Jesus &#8220;appointed twelve that they might be with Him&#8221; before sending them out (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their companionship provides protection and validation. When Saul soon calls Israel to arms against Nahash, these men are already in place (<a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates later crisis moments when loyal followers stand with God&#8217;s anointed, such as Ittai with David during Absalom&#8217;s revolt (<a href="/2_samuel/15-19.htm">2 Samuel 15:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a> shows a freshly anointed but untested king returning home, already surrounded by divinely stirred, battle-ready supporters.

We may conclude that his fellow citizens, proud of the honour conferred on one of themselves, were among his earliest devoted attendants. The young hero, however, as we shall see, had not long to wait for an opportunity of displaying his prowess, and of rallying the hearts of the people generally firmly to his standard.<p><span class= "bld">A band of men.</span>--Among these early friends. doubtless, were to be found the names of the distinguished men whom we hear of later surrounding Saul. The highest prudence and sagacity marked all the early period of the reign of the first king. Slow to take offence, we shall see from the next verse how Saul and his valiant adherents busied themselves in conciliating the disaffected, and in preparing for a decisive action against the enemies who were on all sides harrying the land. An opportunity (see the history in the next chapter) soon presented itself of showing that the choice of a king had been wisely made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - Saul did not at once enter upon his duties, but <span class="cmt_word">went home to Gibeah, and there went with him,</span> not <span class="cmt_word">a band of men</span>, but <span class="accented">the host</span>, or <span class="accented">the force, i.e.</span> those brave men <span class="cmt_word">whose hearts God had touched.</span> Whatever was noble and valiant accompanied him, to take counsel for the nation's good; <span class="cmt_word">but the children of Belial,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthless, good for nothing creatures (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>), <span class="cmt_word">despised him.</span> In the A.V. the antithesis between <span class="accented">the force</span>, the strength and bravery that went with Saul, and the <span class="accented">worthlessness</span> which rejected him, is lost by the mistranslation of both words. The Septuagint, on the contrary, strengthens it by rendering "sons of strength" and "pestilent sons." As there was a garrison in the district of Gibeah, this proceeding was likely to embroil Saul with the Philistines, and probably was so intended. They <span class="cmt_word">brought him no presents</span>. Apparently, therefore, the people did bring him presents; and as these would chiefly consist of food, they would be useful only for maintaining a body of men. This, too, would scarcely escape the notice of so watchful an enemy, and yet until Saul smote one of their garrisons they did nothing; but then, forthwith, they invaded Israel so promptly, and with such overwhelming numbers, as seems to prove that they had been busily making preparations meanwhile to maintain their empire. <span class="cmt_word">He held his peace.</span> Literally, "was as one that is deaf." Had Saul not controlled his anger, a civil war would have been the result, and the lordly tribes of Ephraim and Judah might have refused a king chosen from the little tribe of Benjamin. In fact, Judah never does seem to have given a hearty allegiance to Saul. The Septuagint, followed by Josephus, offers a not improbable different reading, which involves but a very slight change in the Hebrew. Uniting the words with the next chapter, they translate, "And it came to pass, after about a month, that Nahash the Ammonite," etc. The Vulgate has both readings. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1448;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
