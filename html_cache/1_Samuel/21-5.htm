This interaction takes place during David's flight from King Saul, highlighting David's leadership and his ability to address concerns with wisdom and authority. David's response is strategic, aiming to reassure the priest and secure provisions for his men.<p><b>Women have indeed been kept from us</b><br>In ancient Israel, it was customary for men to abstain from sexual relations before engaging in holy activities or warfare, as a means of maintaining ritual purity. This practice is rooted in the belief that physical purity was necessary for spiritual readiness. David assures Ahimelech that his men have adhered to this practice, emphasizing their commitment to maintaining holiness.<p><b>as is usual when I set out</b><br>David refers to a standard practice he follows, indicating a disciplined approach to leadership and spiritual observance. This phrase underscores David's consistency in ensuring that his men are prepared both physically and spiritually for their missions. It reflects the broader cultural and religious norms of ancient Israel regarding purity and preparation.<p><b>And the bodies of the young men are holy even on common missions</b><br>David argues that his men maintain a level of holiness even during ordinary tasks, suggesting that their dedication to God is not limited to special occasions. This statement highlights the importance of continual spiritual discipline and purity, drawing a parallel to the New Testament call for believers to live holy lives at all times (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>How much more so today!</b><br>David emphasizes the heightened significance of their current mission, implying that the need for holiness is even greater given the circumstances. This phrase suggests an awareness of the gravity of the situation and the necessity for divine favor and protection. It also foreshadows the greater mission of Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect holiness and purity, fulfilling the law and offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

In doing so, he underscores the principle that faithful obedience in everyday life prepares believers for extraordinary moments of divine provision and service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The vessels.</span>--Their clothes and light, portable baggage--answering to the modern "knapsack." The Vulg. renders the Hebrew word by "vasa." David means to say, "Since we have just left home, you may readily suppose that no impurity has been contracted; it would be different if we were returning home from a journey, when on the way--especially in war--uncleanness might be contracted by the blood of enemies or otherwise."--Seb. Schmid, quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange.</span><p>The LXX., by a very slight change in the Hebrew letters, instead of "the vessels of the young men," render, "all the young men."<p><span class= "bld">And the bread is in a manner common.</span>--The original is here very difficult, almost utterly obscure. The English Version of the clause is simply meaningless. Of the many translations which have been suggested, two at least offer a fairly good sense. (<span class= "ital">a</span>)<span class= "ital"> "And if it is an unholy way </span>(viz., the way David and his band were going--his purpose or enterprise), <span class= "ital">moreover there is also the fact that it becomes holy through the instrument"</span> (viz., through me, as an ambassador of the anointed of the Lord), on the supposition of the important royal mission upon which David pretended to be sent. So Keil and O. von Gerlach. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) Lange, however, and Thenius, maintain that the words in question must contain a remark by which the priest is to be induced to give the bread, and would translate, "<span class= "ital">Though it is an unholy </span>(ceremonially illegal) <span class= "ital">procedure </span>(to take the shewbread), <span class= "ital">yet it is sanctified </span>(to-day) <span class= "ital">through the instrument"</span> (David or Ahimelech). The instrument is here David, the appointed messenger of the Lord's anointed, or, even better, Ahimelech, the sacred person of the high priest.<p>No doubt, the words of <a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm" title="And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.">Leviticus 24:9</a>, which speak of the destination of the stale shewbread--"And they (Aaron and his sons) shall eat it in the holy place"--suggested the practice of the Church of England embodied in the Rubric following the" Order of the Administration of the Holy Communion"--"And if any" (of the bread and wine) "remain of that which was consecrated, it shall not be carried out of the church, but the priest, and such other of the communicants as he shall then call unto him, shall immediately after the blessing reverently eat and drink the same." Among the legendary Jewish lore that has gathered round the history of this transaction is one strange tradition that the holy bread thus given became useless in the hands of the king's fugitive. (See Stanley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 22, quoting from Jerome.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">About these three days since I came out.</span> This exactly agrees with the time during which David had lain concealed (<a href="/1_samuel/20-24.htm">1 Samuel 20:24, 27, 35</a>), and explains the hunger under which he was suffering, as he had no doubt taken with him only feed sufficient for his immediate wants, he wishes, however, the high priest to believe that he had been engaged with his men during this time on public business, whereas they had been at home and some of them possibly were unclean. The whole chapter sets David before us in a very humiliating light. Just as some books of Homer are styled "the prowess" of some hero, so this chapter might be called David's degradation. The determined hatred of Saul seems to have thrown him off his balance, and it was not till he got among the hills of Judah, wherein was the cave of Adullam, that he recovered his serenity. <span class="cmt_word">The vessels of the young men.</span> Their scrips, in which they would carry the bread, and their baggage generally. <span class="cmt_word">The bread is in a manner common,</span> etc. The word <span class="accented">bread</span> is supplied by the translators, to give some sense to this most difficult passage. Literally translated, the two last clauses are, "And the way is profane, although it be sanctified today in the vessel." Among the numerous interpretations of these words the following seems the best: "And though our journey be not connected with a religious object, yet it (the bread) will be kept holy in the vessel (in which it will be carried)." There is no difficulty in supplying <span class="accented">bread</span> in the last clause, as the shewbread was the subject of the conversation, and a nominative is constantly supplied by the mind from the principal matter that is occupying the thoughts of the speakers. David's argument, therefore, is that both his attendants and their wallets were free from legal defilement, and that though their expedition was on some secular business, yet that at all events the bread would be secure from pollution. <span class="cmt_word">The shewbread that was taken from before Jehovah.</span> The Talmud ('Menach.,' 92, 2) points out that this bread was not newly taken out of the sanctuary, but, as the last clause shows, had been removed on some previous day. As after a week's exposure it was stale and dry, the priests, we are told, ate but little of it, and the rest was left (see Talmud, 'Tract. Yom.,' 39, 1). It also points out that, had such violations of the Levitical law been common, so much importance would not have been attached to this incident. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6030.htm">Strong's 6030: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer, respond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Women [have]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">indeed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[been] kept</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1467;&#1469;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;u&#183;r&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6113.htm">Strong's 6113: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inclose, to hold back, to maintain, rule, assemble</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from us,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1433;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
