It was here that the Ark of the Covenant was housed, making it a focal point for worship and divine encounters. The continued appearance of the LORD at Shiloh signifies His ongoing presence and favor, despite the spiritual decline during the period of the Judges. This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God in maintaining a relationship with His people, even when they stray. The divine appearances at Shiloh also highlight the importance of this location in Israel's history, as it was a place where God chose to reveal Himself and communicate His will.<p><b>because there He revealed Himself to Samuel</b><br>Samuel was a pivotal figure in Israel's history, serving as the last judge, a prophet, and a priest. His role in transitioning Israel from a loose confederation of tribes to a unified monarchy under Saul and David was crucial. The revelation of God to Samuel marks the beginning of his prophetic ministry, which would have a lasting impact on the nation. This revelation is significant because it represents a shift from the period of the Judges, characterized by sporadic leadership and moral chaos, to a time of prophetic guidance and divine order. Samuel's ability to hear and understand God's voice set him apart as a leader who would faithfully convey God's messages to the people.<p><b>by His word</b><br>The phrase "by His word" emphasizes the means through which God chose to reveal Himself to Samuel. In the biblical context, God's word is powerful and creative, as seen in the Genesis account of creation. It is also authoritative and instructive, providing guidance and direction for His people. The revelation of God through His word to Samuel highlights the importance of divine communication in guiding the nation of Israel. This method of revelation also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh in the New Testament. Just as God revealed Himself to Samuel through His word, He ultimately revealed Himself to humanity through Jesus, the living Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reveals Himself to His people and communicates His will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young prophet and judge in Israel, dedicated to the LORD by his mother Hannah, and serving under Eli the priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>A significant religious center in Israel during this period, where the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant were located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine communication and revelation given to Samuel, marking him as a true prophet of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_revelation.htm">Divine Revelation</a></b><br>God reveals Himself to those who are attentive and willing to listen.
