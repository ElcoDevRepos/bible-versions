This phrase sets the scene in the pastoral life of David before his rise to prominence. David, the youngest of Jesse's sons, is often seen as a type of Christ, who also came from humble beginnings. The familial relationship highlights the importance of obedience and respect within the family structure, a value deeply rooted in the culture of ancient Israel.<p><b>Take this ephah of roasted grain</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about half a bushel. Roasted grain was a common food staple, indicating the simplicity and sustenance of the provisions. This act of sending food reflects the care and provision of Jesse for his sons, who were serving in Saul's army. It also foreshadows the provision of God through David, who would later provide spiritual sustenance to Israel.<p><b>and these ten loaves of bread</b><br>Bread is a fundamental element of sustenance in the biblical narrative, often symbolizing life and provision. The number ten can signify completeness or divine order in biblical numerology. This provision of bread not only meets the physical needs of Jesse's sons but also prefigures the spiritual nourishment that Christ, the Bread of Life, would offer to humanity.<p><b>for your brothers</b><br>David's brothers were part of Saul's army, engaged in the conflict with the Philistines. This familial duty underscores the theme of brotherly care and responsibility. It also sets the stage for David's encounter with Goliath, where he would step into his role as Israel's deliverer, much like Christ, who is described as our elder brother in the faith.<p><b>and hurry to their camp</b><br>The urgency in Jesse's command reflects the pressing nature of the situation at the battlefront. The camp of Israel was located in the Valley of Elah, a significant geographical location for the impending confrontation with the Philistines. This urgency can be seen as a parallel to the urgency of the gospel message, which calls for immediate response and action.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David, a man from Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah.
