This change was initiated by the people's demand for a king to lead them like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin, was anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). His reign began with promise, as he was chosen by God to deliver Israel from its enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>).<p><b>he fought against all his enemies on every side</b><br>Saul's reign was characterized by constant warfare, as Israel was surrounded by hostile nations. This phrase highlights the perpetual state of conflict that defined his kingship. The enemies mentioned were longstanding adversaries of Israel, often threatening their security and sovereignty. Saul's military campaigns were crucial in establishing Israel's territorial integrity and political stability.<p><b>the Moabites</b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>) and often in conflict with Israel. Located east of the Dead Sea, Moab was a frequent adversary during the period of the judges (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>). Saul's battles against Moab were part of his efforts to secure Israel's eastern borders.<p><b>the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites, also descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), were another eastern neighbor of Israel. They were a constant threat, as seen in their siege of Jabesh-gilead, which Saul famously relieved (1 Samuel 11). Saul's victories over the Ammonites helped to solidify his reputation as a capable leader early in his reign.<p><b>the Edomites</b><br>The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother (<a href="/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>). Their territory lay to the south of Israel. Historically, there was animosity between Israel and Edom, stemming from their ancestral rivalry. Saul's campaigns against Edom were part of his broader strategy to secure Israel's southern flank.<p><b>the kings of Zobah</b><br>Zobah was a Syrian kingdom located to the north of Israel. The mention of "kings" suggests a coalition or multiple rulers, indicating the complexity of the political landscape Saul faced. Zobah's inclusion highlights Saul's efforts to extend Israel's influence and protect its northern borders.<p><b>and the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were perhaps Israel's most formidable enemies during Saul's reign. They were a seafaring people settled along the coastal plain of Canaan. The Philistines had superior military technology, including iron weapons, which posed a significant threat to Israel. Saul's ongoing battles with the Philistines were a central theme of his kingship, culminating in his death at their hands (1 Samuel 31).<p><b>Wherever he turned, he routed them</b><br>This phrase underscores Saul's military prowess and God's favor in granting him victories. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from its enemies through Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>). However, Saul's successes were often marred by his disobedience to God, leading to his eventual rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). Saul's military achievements foreshadow the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, the true King, who defeats all spiritual enemies and establishes an eternal kingdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Their superior weapons and coastal strongholds made each victory significant.<p>This catalog proves that no single enemy could monopolize Saul&#8217;s attention; God enabled him to confront every foe that threatened covenant land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wherever he turned, he routed them</b><p>&#8220;Wherever he turned, he routed them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses total dominance&#8212;Saul doesn&#8217;t merely survive; he triumphs. Similar wording marks David&#8217;s later reign (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>,14), linking royal success to divine favor.<p>&#8226; The credit ultimately belongs to the LORD, &#8220;for the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>). Saul&#8217;s early obedience allowed God&#8217;s power to flow unhindered, granting Israel the security Moses had promised: &#8220;rest on every side&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Sadly, the verse is also a hinge in Saul&#8217;s story. His outward victories contrast sharply with the inward drift that soon brings divine rejection (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>). The narrative warns that military success is no substitute for wholehearted obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> summarizes the bright beginning of Saul&#8217;s reign. Once his kingship was firmly established, he waged successful campaigns against every surrounding enemy&#8212;Moab, Ammon, Edom, Zobah, and the Philistines. These victories, granted by God, demonstrate that Israel&#8217;s first king initially fulfilled the people&#8217;s cry for someone to fight their battles. The verse celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to protect His covenant people, even as it foreshadows the need for continued obedience if such blessing is to last.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">So Saul took the kingdom over Israel.</span>--Some expositors closely connect this verse with the successful termination of the Philistine war, considering that it was through this great victory over the nation which had so long harassed and impoverished Israel that Saul really acquired for the first time the regal authority over all Israel, and that previously his rule had only been acknowledged in certain of the tribes. It is, however, better to consider the statement contained in this verse as simply a general view of Saul's reign, which was a reign of perpetual wars. The words, then, of our verse are simply introductory to the list of wars waged from the very beginning of his government. It should be observed that this view is supported by the mention of the Ammonite war, which took place a considerable time before the events just related. Such a mention would, therefore, be out of place, unless we take this verse as containing a general statement--in other words, "Saul assumed the reins of government, and during his reign he waged the following wars."<p><span class= "bld">On every side . . . Moab . . . Ammon . . . Edom . . . Zobah . . . Philistines.</span>--This enumeration of the nations with whom he fought literally included the countries on every side of the Land of Promise. Moab and Ammon bounded the Israelites on the east; Edom on the south; the Philistines on the west, along the coast of the Mediterranean; while Zobah was a district of Syria on the north-east of the territory of the twelve tribes, lying between the Euphrates and the Syrian Orontes.<p><span class= "bld">He vexed them.</span>--The exact sense of the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">yar'shia, </span>rendered in our version "he vexed," has puzzled all commentators. The LXX. evidently read another word here, as they translate it by <span class= "ital">es?zeto, </span>"he was preserved." The majority of the versions and Gesenius, however, give the real sense: "Whithersoever he (Saul) turned himself <span class= "ital">lie was victorious." </span>Luther's rendering is scholarly: "Whithersoever he turned <span class= "ital">he inflicted punishment," </span>and is adopted by Keil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Saul took the kingdom.</span> Instead of <span class="accented">so</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">and</span>, rightly; for this is no result or consequence of Saul's victory over the Philistines, but a mere historical introduction to the summary of his wars. The more correct translation would be, "When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought," etc. Saul's reign was valiant and full of military glory. He was, in fact, in war all that the people had longed for, and not only. did he gain independence for Israel.. but laid the foundation of the vast empire of David and Solomon. But it is not the purpose of Holy, Scripture to give us the history of all Saul s valiant exploits, but only of his moral probation and failure. Of wars we read more than enough in profane history; here we read of the formation of character, and how a hero in the midst of noble and worthy feats of arms may yet lose something nobler and worthier - the favour of God. On every side. Moab and Ammon were on the east, Edom on the south, Zobah on the northeast, and the Philistines on the west. Zobah lay beyond Damascus, and, from the accounts given in <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, must have been a powerful state. <span class="cmt_word">He vexed them.</span> The verb is a judicial one, used of punishing the guilty, and might be translated "he chastised them." The Syriac and Vulgate give the real sense - "he was victorious." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
