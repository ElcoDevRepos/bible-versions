Ahimelech is the high priest at Nob, where the tabernacle is located. This encounter highlights David's desperate situation and his need for assistance. Ahimelech's role as a priest is significant, as priests were intermediaries between God and the people, and David's approach to him indicates a search for divine guidance and provision.<p><b>&#8220;Is there not a spear or sword on hand here?</b><br>David's request for a weapon underscores his unpreparedness and vulnerability. In ancient Israel, weapons were not only tools of war but also symbols of power and protection. The absence of a weapon suggests David's haste and the gravity of his flight from Saul. This moment foreshadows David's reliance on God rather than human strength, a theme prevalent throughout his life.<p><b>For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me,</b><br>David's lack of personal armament is unusual for a warrior of his stature, indicating the urgency and unexpected nature of his departure. This phrase emphasizes the immediacy of his situation and his reliance on others for support. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God providing for His chosen ones in times of need, as seen in other narratives where God supplies what is lacking.<p><b>because the king&#8217;s mission was urgent.&#8221;</b><br>David's explanation to Ahimelech is a strategic half-truth. While he is indeed on a mission, it is not one sanctioned by King Saul. This statement reflects the tension between David's loyalty to Saul as the anointed king and his need to protect himself from Saul's unjust pursuit. The urgency of the mission underscores the perilous nature of David's journey and his need for immediate assistance. This situation can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced opposition and misunderstanding during His earthly ministry, yet remained faithful to His divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and at this point, fleeing from King Saul who seeks his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a></b><br>The priest at Nob who provides David with consecrated bread and later, Goliath's sword.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>A city of priests where the tabernacle was located during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_saul.htm">King Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who perceives David as a threat to his throne and seeks to kill him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath's_sword.htm">Goliath's Sword</a></b><br>The weapon David used to kill Goliath, which was kept at Nob and given to David by Ahimelech.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_in_times_of_need.htm">Reliance on God in Times of Need</a></b><br>David's request for a weapon highlights his vulnerability and need for God's provision.

His question reveals several truths:<p>&#8226; David knows the tabernacle precincts sometimes hold items dedicated after great victories (compare <a href="/1_samuel/17-54.htm">1 Samuel 17:54</a>).<p>&#8226; He approaches the priest rather than a soldier, showing how closely spiritual and practical needs intertwine (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>, written about this flight).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Is there not a spear or sword on hand here?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The request is specific: David needs a real weapon, not mere ritual reassurance.<p>&#8226; He looks for one &#8220;on hand,&#8221; suggesting urgency and scarcity. The only sword present will be Goliath&#8217;s, stored &#8220;behind the ephod&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), reminding us that past victories can become present provision (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly highlights God&#8217;s ability to supply in unexpected places&#8212;ravens for Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>) or loaves and fish for thousands (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s statement underscores how quickly he had to leave Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; It pictures dependence: stripped of his normal defenses, he relies on God&#8217;s sovereign care, echoing <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>, &#8220;When I am afraid, I will trust in You.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His lack of arms contrasts with the champion&#8217;s sword he is about to receive, showing how God often replaces what is lost with something greater (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Because the king&#8217;s mission was urgent.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David gives Ahimelech a cover story, claiming Saul sent him. Scripture reports the lie without approving it (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9&#8211;19</a> for consequences).<p>&#8226; The urgency theme threads the chapter: hasty flight, hurried eating of the holy bread, and immediate arming. Crisis moments reveal character and force decisive faith (<a href="/psalms/31-1.htm">Psalm 31:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even amid David&#8217;s imperfect words, the narrative affirms that God&#8217;s plan marches on; Saul&#8217;s threats cannot cancel divine promises (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/21-8.htm">1 Samuel 21:8</a> shows David in desperate transition&#8212;weaponless, hunted, and dependent. He seeks tangible help from a priest, demonstrating that God&#8217;s sanctuary is a place for both spiritual refuge and practical supply. The verse highlights urgency, honest need, and the irony of the champion acquiring Goliath&#8217;s own sword. David&#8217;s imperfect choices cannot derail God&#8217;s perfect purposes; the Lord provides, protects, and propels His anointed toward the throne He has promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Spear or sword?</span>--We may well suppose <span class= "ital">to what </span>David pointed when he made his request--the famous sword, the trophy of the combat which had for ever made his name illustrious. In the first flush of gratitude to the invisible One who had stood by him in the hour of peril, he had doubtless taken and presented to the sanctuary guardians, as an offering to be kept for ever, a memorial of the victory of Israel over the uncircumcised; but now, in his hour of need and humiliation, he needed all the credentials he could gather together of his ability and power to lead men, so he trusts the priest will let him have his glorious prize back again. This seems to have been really the meaning of his petition to Ahimelech, and so evidently the priest understood David, for at once he suggested restoring the well-known, treasured sword. The sanctuary, he said, possesses no war weapon but that one which hangs up among us, a votive offering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there not here under thine hand spear or sword?</span> The sight of Doeg made David feel how helpless he was in case of attack, and he excuses his request for weapons by saying that he had left home unarmed because of the urgeney of the king's business. The whole matter must have seemed very suspicious to Ahimelech, but he was powerless, and answers that the only weapon in the sanctuary was David's own votive offering, the sword of Goliath, carefully deposited in a place of honour behind the ephod with the Urim and Thummim, and <span class="cmt_word">wrapped in a cloth</span> for its protection. As the word is used in <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a> of military attire, it may mean Goliath's war mantle, but more probably it was a covering to preserve it from rust and damp. In <a href="/1_samuel/17-54.htm">1 Samuel 17:54</a> it is said that Goliath's armour became David's private property, and nothing could be more natural than that he should thus lay up the sword in the tabernacle, as a thank offering to God. He now takes it with pleasure, saying, <span class="cmt_word">There is none like that;</span> for it was a memorial of his greatest achievement, and might be the presage of good fortune again.
