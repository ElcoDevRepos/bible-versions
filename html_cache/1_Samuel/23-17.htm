The phrase "Do not be afraid" is a common biblical exhortation, often used by God or His messengers to reassure His people (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). It reflects a divine assurance of protection and guidance, encouraging trust in God's plan despite present dangers.<p><b>for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you.</b><br>Jonathan reassures David of his safety from Saul, who is actively seeking David's life. This statement is significant because it reflects Jonathan's faith in God's protection over David. Despite Saul's intentions, Jonathan believes in God's sovereignty and His promise to David. This echoes the biblical theme that God's plans cannot be thwarted by human actions (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>).<p><b>And you will be king over Israel,</b><br>Jonathan acknowledges David's future as king, which aligns with God's anointing of David through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). This recognition by Jonathan, the heir apparent, underscores the divine legitimacy of David's future kingship. It also highlights Jonathan's humility and submission to God's will, as he willingly accepts David's God-ordained role.<p><b>and I will be your second-in-command.</b><br>Jonathan expresses his willingness to serve under David, demonstrating his loyalty and friendship. This reflects the biblical principle of servant leadership and the importance of supporting God's chosen leaders. Jonathan's attitude contrasts with Saul's jealousy and fear, showcasing a selfless commitment to God's plan.<p><b>Even my father Saul knows this is true.&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan asserts that Saul is aware of David's destined kingship, despite his attempts to prevent it. This acknowledgment indicates Saul's internal conflict and recognition of God's will, even as he resists it. It highlights the futility of opposing God's purposes and serves as a reminder of the prophetic nature of God's promises, which are evident throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, and currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, a loyal friend to David, and a man of faith who recognizes God's plan for David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in pursuit of David due to jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David is prophesied to become king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_ziph.htm">Wilderness of Ziph</a></b><br>The location where Jonathan meets David to encourage him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Jonathan's words to David reflect a deep trust in God's plan.

This is the same reassurance the Lord gave Abram (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>), Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), and later His disciples (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). Fear is unnecessary when God&#8217;s plan is certain. Jonathan calls David to rest in that certainty rather than in shifting circumstances.<p>&#8226; David has already seen divine deliverance (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>); Jonathan simply reminds him of what is consistently true.<p>&#8226; Like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, the phrase ties courage directly to God&#8217;s active presence and promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you</b><p>Jonathan states an outcome that looks impossible to the human eye&#8212;Saul is actively hunting David&#8212;yet he speaks with settled conviction. <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> records David&#8217;s own testimony that &#8220;the angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them.&#8221; Saul&#8217;s murderous intent cannot override God&#8217;s protective decree.<p>&#8226; Later events vindicate Jonathan&#8217;s words: twice David stands within arm&#8217;s reach of Saul yet remains untouched (<a href="/1_samuel/24-10.htm">1 Samuel 24:10</a>; 26:23).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over human hostility is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you will be king over Israel</b><p>Jonathan affirms what God had already declared when Samuel anointed David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The line of succession is therefore settled in heaven, not by palace politics. This promise ultimately looks forward to the everlasting covenant with David&#8217;s house (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20-29</a>) and the birth of David&#8217;s greater Son (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan speaks as witness, not merely as friend; he aligns himself with divine revelation.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s eventual coronation in Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>) proves the literal fulfillment of this word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will be your second-in-command</b><p>Jonathan, the rightful heir in human terms, willingly takes the lesser place. His humility mirrors the self-emptying mindset urged in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>. He chooses covenant loyalty over personal advancement (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3-4</a>; 20:4).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s stance highlights genuine faith: he submits to God&#8217;s plan even when it costs him the throne.<p>&#8226; His offer models servant leadership, anticipating New-Testament calls to esteem others above self.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even my father Saul knows this is true</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s final line underscores how undeniable David&#8217;s destiny has become. Saul himself will later confess, &#8220;I know for certain that you will be king&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-20.htm">1 Samuel 24:20</a>). The very adversary grudgingly validates the prophecy.<p>&#8226; This admission reveals the futility of fighting God&#8217;s decree. <a href="/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a> echoes the principle: &#8220;If it is from God, you will not be able to stop them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s knowledge increases his accountability; opposing David equates to opposing God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a> is a Spirit-inspired reminder that God&#8217;s promises stand firm, fear can be laid aside, hostile plans cannot thwart divine purpose, humility is the right response to God&#8217;s choice, and even opponents eventually acknowledge the truth. Jonathan&#8217;s words call believers to the same confidence, submission, and courage today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And I shall be next unto thee.</span>--To us--who read a few pages on in the record of these times how this same generous, loving friend found a grave on Mount Gilboa instead of a home with David, whom he admired with so ungrudging an admiration--these words of Jonathan possess a pathetic interest of their own. That brave, romantic career was nearly run when he met David for the last time in the woods of Ziph. As far as we can judge, if Jonathan had lived he would have certainly ceded any rights he had to the throne of his father Saul in favour of David, unlike that other comparatively unknown son of Saul, Ishbosheth, who set up as a rival claimant to the son of Jesse. But his generosity was not to be exposed to any such severe test, and David was spared the presence of such a rival as the gallant and gifted Jonathan would assuredly have been to him.<p><span class= "bld">And that also Saul my father knoweth.</span>--It is very likely by this time that the circumstance of Samuel's mysterious anointing of the son of Jesse years before at Bethlehem had become known to Saul. Now that David had been openly proclaimed a public enemy, and that the king had repeatedly and openly sought his life, there was no reason for any concealment. No doubt, by this time very many in Israel looked on him as the anointed successor of Saul. The covenant alluded to in the next verse was, of course, the old covenant of eternal friendship which they had made when they parted outside Gibeah at the New Moon feast, as we find related at length in 1 Samuel 20.<p>After this meeting David never looked on Jonathan's face in life again.<p>"Oh, heart of fire! misjudged by wilful man,<p>Thou flower of Jesse's race!<p>What woe was thine when thou and Jonathan<p>Last greeted face to face!<p>He doomed to die, thou on us to impress<p>The portent of a blood-stained holiness."<p><span class= "ital">Lyra Apostolica.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
