His authority and leadership are recognized by the people, and his words carry significant weight. This moment is a public declaration, emphasizing the communal aspect of Israel's governance and the importance of divine guidance in leadership decisions.<p><b>Do you see the one the LORD has chosen?</b><br>The selection of Saul as king is portrayed as a divine choice, underscoring the belief that God is actively involved in the leadership of His people. This echoes the biblical theme of God choosing leaders, as seen with Moses and David. The emphasis on divine selection highlights the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations and individuals.<p><b>There is no one like him among all the people.</b><br>Saul's physical stature and appearance set him apart, as he is described earlier in the chapter as being taller than any of the people. This phrase suggests that Saul's unique qualities make him suitable for kingship, reflecting the cultural importance of physical presence and leadership. However, it also foreshadows the potential pitfalls of valuing outward appearance over inner character, a theme further explored in the selection of David.<p><b>And all the people shouted, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</b><br>This acclamation signifies the people's acceptance and support of Saul as their king, marking a significant shift in Israel's governance. The phrase "Long live the king" is a traditional expression of loyalty and hope for a prosperous reign. This moment reflects the cultural practices of surrounding nations, where kingship was a common form of government, and highlights Israel's desire to be like other nations, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy.

Saul is not a concession alone; he is divinely commissioned, anointed with oil (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), and confirmed by prophetic signs (10:6-7).<p>&#8226; The phrase also anticipates Christ, the ultimately &#8220;Chosen One&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>), teaching that every earthly ruler points forward to the perfect King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is no one like him among all the people</b><p>Samuel notes Saul&#8217;s exceptional qualities.<p>&#8226; Physically, Saul &#8220;was a head taller than anyone else&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>), an outward sign that matched Israel&#8217;s desire for a king who could &#8220;go out before us and fight our battles&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Socially, Saul comes from the least clan of Benjamin, highlighting God&#8217;s pattern of exalting the humble (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, God has &#8220;changed Saul&#8217;s heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a>), equipping him for the task. Though later failures will emerge, the initial declaration is true: at this moment, no one else combines these God-given traits.<p>&#8226; This uniqueness prefigures David&#8217;s later description&#8212;&#8220;a man after God&#8217;s own heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>)&#8212;and ultimately Christ, of whom <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a> declares, &#8220;Who is worthy?&#8221; Only One.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all the people shouted, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</b><p>The crowd&#8217;s acclamation seals Saul&#8217;s coronation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Long live the king&#8221; becomes Israel&#8217;s royal salute, reappearing in <a href="/1_kings/1-25.htm">1 Kings 1:25</a> and <a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>.<p>&#8226; The unanimous shout signals covenantal agreement: the people accept Saul just as they earlier accepted the Lord&#8217;s thunderous victory at Mizpah (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; National unity emerges; the tribes that were once fractured in <a href="/bsb/judges/21.htm">Judges 21</a> now rally under a single monarch.<p>&#8226; Yet their cry also carries prophetic tension. <a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a> prays that the king&#8217;s &#8220;name endure forever,&#8221; ultimately satisfied only in Messiah Jesus, whose kingdom &#8220;will never end&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a> records a watershed: God publicly presents Saul, the people affirm him, and the monarchy in Israel formally begins. Samuel highlights divine choice, Saul&#8217;s distinctive suitability, and the nation&#8217;s enthusiastic consent. The verse teaches that leadership originates with God, that He equips those He appoints, and that human affirmation should echo divine selection. While Saul&#8217;s reign will reveal human frailty, the passage points beyond him to the unfailing reign of Christ, the true and everlasting King.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
