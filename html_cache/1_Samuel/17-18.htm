The act of sending cheese to the commander highlights the importance of maintaining good relations with military leaders, as well as the practical need to supply soldiers with food. This gesture reflects the cultural practice of offering gifts to those in authority, which is seen throughout the Old Testament. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in the Bible, suggesting that David's task was thorough and well-planned. This act of service by David foreshadows his future role as a leader who cares for his people, much like Jesus, who is described as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>.<p><b>Check on the welfare of your brothers</b><br>David's mission to check on his brothers aligns with the familial responsibilities emphasized in the culture of ancient Israel, where family ties were strong and caring for one's kin was a priority. This phrase underscores the importance of family loyalty and concern, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. It also sets the stage for David's encounter with Goliath, as his obedience to his father Jesse's request leads him to the battlefield. This mirrors the obedience of Christ to His Father, as seen in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where Jesus states He came to do the will of the Father.<p><b>and bring back an assurance from them.</b><br>The request for assurance indicates a desire for a report on the brothers' safety and well-being, reflecting the anxiety and uncertainty of wartime. This phrase highlights the importance of communication and accountability within families and communities. In a broader biblical context, it can be seen as a precursor to the role of prophets and leaders who bring back messages from God to His people. David's role as a messenger here is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate messenger and assurance of God's love and salvation, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, who is tasked with delivering food to his brothers and checking on their welfare.

The detail underscores that God records even the small logistics of battlefield life, showing Scripture&#8217;s reliability in historical particulars (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>; <a href="/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Gifts to leaders open doors of goodwill (<a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>). By honoring authority, Jesse models the biblical principle of showing respect to those in charge (<a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Ten portions indicate sufficiency and generosity, mirroring other occasions where family members send ample supplies for care and favor (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s obedience in this mundane errand positions him for the divine appointment with Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22&#8211;23</a>). Faithfulness in small tasks precedes great exploits (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Check on the welfare of your brothers</b><p>&#8220;Check on the welfare of your brothers.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>b)<p>&#8226; Jesse&#8217;s heart of concern echoes Jacob sending Joseph to check on his brothers at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>). Family oversight matters to God.<p>&#8226; The Hebrew concept conveyed by &#8220;welfare&#8221; is shalom&#8212;comprehensive well-being. Scripture often ties genuine love to active interest in another&#8217;s condition (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This directive reminds us that physical and spiritual shepherding begins at home. David, soon to be Israel&#8217;s shepherd-king (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;72</a>), learns pastoral care first toward his own brothers.<p>&#8226; Checking in entails listening, observing, and being ready to help. For believers today, it challenges us to personal involvement, not distant concern (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring back an assurance from them</b><p>&#8220;and bring back an assurance from them.&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>c)<p>&#8226; Jesse seeks confirmation&#8212;literally a tangible token or report&#8212;that all is well. Similar requests appear when loved ones await news from the front (<a href="/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Accountability and communication strengthen trust. Scripture promotes responsible reporting, whether Moses to Jethro (<a href="/exodus/18-8.htm">Exodus 18:8</a>) or the apostles to the church (<a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This requirement protects against vague optimism. Genuine assurance involves concrete evidence, paralleling how God provides believers with the &#8220;earnest&#8221; of the Spirit as pledge of future hope (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s compliance supplies the needed reassurance, illustrating respect for parental authority (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1&#8211;3</a>) and reliability in stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a> captures Jesse&#8217;s threefold instruction: deliver provision, inquire after welfare, and return proof. The verse showcases practical obedience, honor for authority, familial care, and trustworthy reporting&#8212;ordinary actions that God weaves into His extraordinary plan. David&#8217;s readiness to carry cheese and gather news sets the stage for Israel&#8217;s deliverance, reminding us that diligent faithfulness in everyday duties often precedes our greatest opportunities to glorify God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Look how thy brethren fare.</span>--The same learned commentator (Wordsworth), following out this curious line of Patristic interpretation, remarks on these words: "David is sent by his father to his brethren from Bethlehem. So the Divine David, Jesus Christ, who was born at Bethlehem, was sent to His brethren by his Heavenly Father." He completes the analogy between David and Christ by pointing out how David was ill-received by his brethren, though he came at his father's bidding to show them an act of kindness; so Christ, when sent by His Father from heaven on an embassy of love, was ill-received by His own brethren, the Jews.
