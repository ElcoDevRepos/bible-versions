His presence in the army indicates his role as a soldier in Saul's forces. The context of David speaking to the men highlights his curiosity and concern for Israel's plight against the Philistines. This moment foreshadows David's future leadership and his heart for God's people, contrasting with Eliab's dismissive attitude.<p><b>his anger burned against David</b><br>Eliab's anger may stem from jealousy or embarrassment, as David's anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) could have caused tension among the brothers. This reaction also reflects a common human tendency to misinterpret motives, especially when feeling threatened or insecure. Eliab's anger contrasts with David's faith and courage, setting the stage for David's rise as a leader.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you come down here?&#8221; he asked</b><br>Eliab's question implies suspicion and disbelief in David's intentions. It reflects a protective, perhaps condescending, attitude towards his younger brother. This question also underscores the perceived inappropriateness of David's presence on the battlefield, given his youth and role as a shepherd.<p><b>&#8220;And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?&#8221;</b><br>This remark belittles David's responsibilities, emphasizing the perceived insignificance of his duties compared to the battle at hand. It highlights the cultural view of shepherding as a lowly occupation, yet it is significant that many biblical leaders, including Moses and Jesus, are associated with shepherding, symbolizing care and leadership.<p><b>I know your pride and wickedness of heart</b><br>Eliab accuses David of arrogance and malicious intent, projecting his own insecurities onto his brother. This accusation is ironic, as David is later described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The theme of misjudging others' hearts is prevalent in Scripture, reminding believers to seek God's perspective rather than relying on human judgment.<p><b>you have come down to see the battle!&#8221;</b><br>Eliab assumes David's motives are driven by mere curiosity or thrill-seeking, failing to recognize David's genuine concern for Israel's honor and God's glory. This misunderstanding sets the stage for David's demonstration of faith and courage against Goliath, highlighting the contrast between human perception and divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

The casual mention (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34</a>) of the boy's prowess, when the lion and the bear attacked his father's flock, tells us that the boyhood and youth of David had been no ordinary one, and Eliab's jealous disposition had been, doubtless, often aroused. Probably, too, the envious elder brother well remembered the visit of the great seer to Bethlehem, and how Samuel had, for some mysterious, and as yet unknown, reason, anointed this young brother of his, and had chosen him to be his pupil and companion. Was he now come with power unknown to him (Eliab) to perform some startling deed of daring?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eliab's anger was kindled against David.</span> As David, with growing indignation at an uncovenanted heathen thus dishonouring the subjects of the living God, puts eager questions to all around, his ehier brother angrily reproaches him with words full of contempt.
