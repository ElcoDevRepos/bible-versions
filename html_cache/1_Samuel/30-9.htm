These men are often referred to as David's "mighty men" or his loyal followers, who have been with him through various trials and battles. This group represents a small but formidable force, highlighting David's leadership and the loyalty he commands. The number six hundred is significant, as it indicates a complete and organized military unit. This group of men had been with David during his time of fleeing from King Saul, showing their dedication and trust in his leadership.<p><b>went to the Brook of Besor</b><br>The Brook of Besor is a geographical location in the southern part of Judah, near the Negev desert. It served as a natural boundary and a place of rest and refreshment. The brook would have provided necessary water for David and his men, as well as their animals. This location is significant as it marks a point of decision and division among David's men. The journey to the Brook of Besor is part of David's pursuit of the Amalekites, who had raided Ziklag, David's temporary home, and taken captives. The brook symbolizes a place of testing and separation, as not all of David's men would continue beyond this point.<p><b>where some stayed behind</b><br>At the Brook of Besor, some of David's men were too exhausted to continue the pursuit of the Amalekites. This detail highlights the human limitations and the physical toll of constant warfare and travel. The decision for some to stay behind was practical, allowing the rest to move more swiftly. This moment also sets the stage for a later lesson in fairness and sharing the spoils of victory, as David would later insist that those who stayed behind would share equally in the plunder with those who fought. This principle of equitable distribution reflects a just and compassionate leadership style, foreshadowing the kind of king David would become.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, known for his leadership and reliance on God.

The "six hundred" by no means represented his present force; but these were probably the old band of veteran soldiers, whose speed and endurance he could depend upon--men tried, no doubt, by many a weary night march, by many a rough, wild piece of work. A large contingent even of these veterans could not stand the forced march of their leader on this occasion.<p>In the words "for two hundred abode behind," the narrator anticipated what is told in <a href="/1_samuel/30-10.htm" title="But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.">1Samuel 30:10</a>. It is a proleptical expression, arising from the vivacious description of David's rapid march with four hundred men (<span class= "ital">Lange</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Vulg. paraphrases, or rather seeks to amend the text here: "and certain tired ones stayed." The Syriac changes the text into "David left two hundred men;" these men who had fallen out of the rapid march were gathered together, and kept the baggage and everything that could be left behind at the encampment at the brook Besor. It is to be supposed that owing to the hurried departure, but scanty provision for the forced march was made, hence the falling out through weariness in the course of the rapid advance. The brook Besor cannot be identified with certainty; and Raumer (<span class= "ital">Palestine</span>) supposes it to be the Wady Shariah, which falls into the sea below Askelon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - Having obtained this favourable answer, David starts in pursuit with his old band of 600 men. So rapid was his march that one third of these dropped out of the ranks, so that the newcomers from Manasseh would have been useless, nor had they lost wives or children. The <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> (or rather "torrent") <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span> practically remains unidentified, as the site of Ziklag is unknown; but possibly it is the Wady-es-Sheriah, which runs into the sea a little to the south of Gaza. As there was water here, <span class="cmt_word">those that were left behind stayed.</span> Hebrew, "the stragglers stayed." It seems also to have been wide enough to cause some difficulty in crossing, as it is said that these 200 were too faint, or tired, <span class="cmt_word">to go over the</span> torrent <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span>. From ver. 24 we find that David also left with them as much as possible of his baggage. Stragglers had no doubt been falling out for some time, but would here be rallied, and obtain rest and refreshment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his six</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
