This moment occurs during a time of great personal and national crisis for Saul, as the Philistine army threatens Israel. Saul's refusal can be seen as a sign of his despair and loss of hope, as he faces the consequences of his disobedience to God. In biblical culture, fasting was often associated with mourning or seeking divine intervention, but here it seems to be more about his emotional state.<p><b>But his servants joined the woman in urging him,</b><br>The servants and the woman, who is the medium at Endor, show concern for Saul's well-being. This reflects the cultural practice of hospitality and care for one's leader, even in dire circumstances. The urging of the servants and the woman highlights the communal aspect of decision-making in ancient Israel, where leaders were often surrounded by advisors and supporters who played a role in guiding their actions.<p><b>and he heeded their voice.</b><br>Saul's decision to listen to his servants and the woman indicates a moment of vulnerability and reliance on others. This is significant because it contrasts with his earlier disobedience to God's commands, where he often acted independently or against divine guidance. The phrase suggests a temporary submission to human counsel, which stands in stark contrast to his failure to heed divine instruction throughout his reign.<p><b>He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.</b><br>Saul's physical movement from the ground to the bed symbolizes a shift from a state of despair to a more stable position, albeit temporarily. In the ancient Near Eastern context, sitting on a bed could imply a return to a semblance of normalcy or readiness to receive sustenance. This action may also foreshadow his impending downfall, as it is a brief respite before the fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy regarding his defeat and death. The bed, a place of rest, contrasts with the turmoil in Saul's heart and the impending doom he faces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of desperation and fear as he faces the Philistine army.

Moments earlier he had &#8220;fallen full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel&#8217;s words; his strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-20.htm">1 Samuel 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; His words echo other biblical scenes where grief, guilt, or dread led to a self-imposed fast&#8212;see <a href="/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>.<p>&#8226; Literally, Saul&#8217;s body is exhausted, but the statement also reveals a heart paralyzed by divine judgment (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-26</a>; 28:15-19). He cannot bring himself to accept help, because his deepest need&#8212;restoration to God&#8212;remains unmet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But his servants joined the woman in urging him</b><p>&#8226; Though Saul had earlier expelled mediums (28:3), this very woman now shows him practical compassion. Like Abigail who interceded for Nabal (25:32-33), she steps into danger to preserve life.<p>&#8226; The servants know their king&#8217;s physical collapse threatens the entire army on the eve of battle (31:1). Their joint pleading mirrors the concern of David&#8217;s servants when he fasted for his sick child (<a href="/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God often uses unexpected voices to press His mercies upon stubborn hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he heeded their voice</b><p>&#8226; The king who once refused to heed the voice of the Lord through Samuel (15:19-22) now listens to human persuasion. The reversal is tragic: he is quick to obey people, slow to obey God.<p>&#8226; Yet even this small obedience shows God&#8217;s common grace at work, keeping Saul alive long enough for the final events to unfold (29:1; 31:1-6).<p>&#8226; The phrase recalls repeated biblical counsel: &#8220;Listen to wise advice&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>; 19:20). Sadly, Saul receives only physical relief, not spiritual renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He got up from the ground</b><p>&#8226; Rising from the ground marks a change in posture. Where lying prostrate symbolized despair (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>), standing or sitting signifies regained composure.<p>&#8226; The movement anticipates his last campaign; strength returns, but destiny is fixed. Saul is living proof that outward recovery can mask inward ruin (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And sat on the bed</b><p>&#8226; The bed (or couch) in ancient homes served as a place for eating and resting (<a href="/judges/19-6.htm">Judges 19:6-7</a>; <a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37-38</a>). By taking this position, Saul accepts the hospitality extended to him.<p>&#8226; Ironically, the man who once shared covenant meals with Samuel (9:22-24) now dines in a forbidden house, sealing the contrast between past favor and present alienation.<p>&#8226; The setting underscores the mercy of God: food is provided even to an unrepentant king, paralleling Jesus&#8217; teaching that the Father &#8220;is kind to the ungrateful and wicked&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-23.htm">1 Samuel 28:23</a> captures a moment of physical care against the backdrop of spiritual catastrophe. Saul&#8217;s initial refusal shows the depth of his fear; the united plea of servants and medium reflects God&#8217;s sustaining providence; his eventual compliance brings temporary strength but no heart change. The verse reminds us that even when divine judgment is certain, the Lord still offers tangible mercies&#8212;and that listening to human counsel can never substitute for obeying the voice of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And sat upon the bed</span>--That is, upon the divan, or cushioned seat, which usually runs round the walls of rooms in Eastern dwellings.
