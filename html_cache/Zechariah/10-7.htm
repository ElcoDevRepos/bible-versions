Historically, Ephraim was a powerful tribe, known for its military prowess. The phrase "like a mighty man" suggests a restoration of strength and valor, indicating a future time when God will empower His people. This imagery connects to prophecies of restoration and victory, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a> and <a href="/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>, where the divided kingdoms are united and strengthened.<p><b>and their hearts will be glad as with wine</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a symbol of joy and celebration. The comparison to wine suggests a deep, exuberant joy that comes from divine blessing and restoration. This joy is not superficial but profound, akin to the joy described in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, where wine is said to gladden the heart. The imagery also points to the Messianic age, where joy and abundance are promised (<a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>Their children will see it and be joyful</b><br>The mention of children highlights the generational impact of God's blessings. It suggests a future where the next generation witnesses and participates in the joy and prosperity of God's restored people. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>. The joy of the children also reflects the peace and security promised in the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>).<p><b>their hearts will rejoice in the LORD</b><br>Rejoicing in the LORD signifies a spiritual renewal and a return to covenant faithfulness. This phrase emphasizes that the source of their joy is not merely material prosperity but a restored relationship with God. It echoes the sentiments of <a href="/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a>, where trust in God's holy name brings joy. This rejoicing is a foretaste of the ultimate joy found in the presence of God, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>, where God dwells with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used to symbolize the ten tribes.

God is promising that the northern tribes&#8212;once scattered and weakened&#8212;will be renewed with warrior-like strength.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the same chapter the prophet said, &#8220;They will be like mighty men, trampling the enemy in the mud of the streets in battle&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>). The idea is consistent: restored Israel will not limp back; it will stand tall.<p>&#8226; This follows the pattern of <a href="/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32&#8211;34</a>, where David testifies that the LORD &#8220;trains my hands for battle.&#8221; The strength is clearly God-given.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a> also links Judah and Ephraim with military imagery: &#8220;I will bend Judah as My bow and fill it with Ephraim.&#8221; The same empowering hand of God lies behind both passages.<p>The phrase announces more than physical prowess. It is a pledge that God can transform the formerly defeated into victorious servants&#8212;something He still delights to do in His people today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their hearts will be glad as with wine</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and their hearts will be glad as with wine&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Wine in Scripture often symbolizes festive joy (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>). Here it paints a picture of exuberant celebration, not drunkenness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6&#8211;9</a> shows a banquet of aged wine set out when the LORD removes His people&#8217;s disgrace.

The focus zooms back to the Person behind the blessing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a> captures the same idea: &#8220;In Him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in His holy name.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a> declares, &#8220;Yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will exult in the God of my salvation.&#8221; Zechariah&#8217;s audience will share that same single-minded delight.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> expresses it perfectly: &#8220;I will rejoice greatly in the LORD; my soul will exult in my God.&#8221; Military victory, festive joy, generational blessing&#8212;all culminate in worship. God Himself is the treasure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/10-7.htm">Zechariah 10:7</a> paints a fourfold picture of restored Israel: empowered like warriors, overflowing with festival joy, passing that joy to the next generation, and ultimately finding its deepest gladness in the LORD Himself. The verse reassures believers in every age that God can turn weakness into strength, sorrow into celebration, and personal blessing into a legacy of praise that centers on Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of Ephraim;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as well as Judah, shall be heroes. Not many members of the northern kingdom returned at first from the Captivity; but the prophet gives the assurance that they shall come and prove themselves mighty warriors. <span class="cmt_word">As through wine.</span> They shall hasten to the battle cheerfully and exultingly, like men refreshed and strengthened with wine (see <a href="/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65, 66</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their children shall see it.</span> Though unable to participate in the struggle, their children shall share the universal joy. <span class="cmt_word">Their heart shall rejoice in the Lord</span> (<a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>). Attempts have been made to find the fulfilment of these prophecies (ver. 3, etc.) in certain events of Maccabean times. Thus, according to Patritius, the sin for which the Hebrews surfeited such distress at the hands of the Seleucidae (ver. 2) was their imitation of heathen practices mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:13-15 and 2 Macc. 4:7-17, when the high priest purchased his office by a bribe, and the other priests followed Greek customs. The prophet is supposed to refer specially to this state of things when he says, "They were troubled because there was no shepherd. Mine auger was kindled against the shepherds." But we have shown above that Zechariah is here speaking of the past, not of the future. There is more verisimilitude in discerning the wars and victories of Judas, his brothers and successors, in the allusions of vers 4-7. The truth is that such descriptions suit many different events, and have various applications. Though their complete fulfilment may be expected only in Messianic times and circumstances, yet we may see many anticipatory and preparative transactions, which are meant to introduce the final accomplishment. The Jewish prophet is not always foretelling certain definite events. Oftentimes he is teaching, warning, and exhorting; and generally he is enunciating great principles, the truth of which shall be clear in the future, rather than predicting particular facts. Not unfrequently commentators have neglected this consideration, and sought too curiously to restrict the prophet's words to some one issue. It may be noted, further, that where the prophetic language concerning the destiny of the restored people seems to be exaggerated and not borne out by subsequent facts, the promises are always conditioned by the moral state of the recipients. If they answered fully and consistently to God's call, the result would be such as was predicted. That the event in all respects did not correspond with the high ideal previously announced must be attributed, not to the prophet's mistake, but to the people's waywardness and disobedience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/10-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
