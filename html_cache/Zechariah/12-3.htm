In prophetic literature, "that day" is frequently associated with the "Day of the Lord," a time when God will act decisively in history. It suggests a specific, appointed time known only to God, emphasizing the certainty and divine orchestration of the events to follow.<p><b>when all the nations of the earth gather against her</b><br>This indicates a global coalition against Jerusalem, symbolizing opposition to God's chosen people. Historically, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict, and this prophecy suggests a future event where nations unite against it.

In ancient times, stones were used as boundary markers or weights, symbolizing permanence and resistance. This metaphor indicates that attempts to move or harm Jerusalem will be futile and burdensome. It reflects God's protection over Jerusalem, making it a divine obstacle to those who oppose it.<p><b>all who would heave it away will be severely injured</b><br>This phrase warns of the consequences for those who attempt to harm or remove Jerusalem. The injury signifies divine retribution and the futility of opposing God's will. It echoes the principle found in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants and curse those who curse them.
