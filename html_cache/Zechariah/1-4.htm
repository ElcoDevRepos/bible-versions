The "fathers" refer to the ancestors of the Israelites who repeatedly disobeyed God. This is a common theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites are often reminded of their forefathers' failures to follow God's commands. The call to not emulate their ancestors is a call to break the cycle of disobedience and rebellion against God.<p><b>to whom the former prophets proclaimed</b><br>The "former prophets" include figures like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others who warned Israel and Judah of the consequences of their disobedience. These prophets were God's messengers, delivering His words and warnings to the people. Their messages often included calls to repentance and foretold the consequences of continued disobedience, such as exile and destruction.<p><b>that this is what the LORD of Hosts says</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power. It portrays God as the commander of heavenly armies, underscoring His authority to issue commands and warnings. This title is used frequently in the prophetic books to remind the people of God's ultimate control over all creation.<p><b>&#8216;Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.&#8217;</b><br>This is a direct call to repentance, urging the people to change their behavior and return to God. "Evil ways and deeds" refer to the sinful actions and lifestyles that are contrary to God's laws. Repentance is a central theme in the Bible, and it involves a complete turning away from sin and a return to God.<p><b>But they did not listen or pay attention to Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the stubbornness and hard-heartedness of the people. Despite numerous warnings and calls to repentance, the Israelites often ignored God's messages. This disobedience led to severe consequences, including the Babylonian exile. The failure to listen is a recurring issue in the relationship between God and His people.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and finality of God's message. When God declares something, it is a definitive statement that carries weight and certainty. It serves as a reminder that the words spoken by the prophets are not their own but are directly from God Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period, Zechariah was called by God to encourage the Israelites to return to Him and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.
