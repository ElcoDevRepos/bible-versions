This phrase sets the stage for a divine action that will transform the spiritual landscape.<p><b>I will erase the names of the idols from the land,</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel's history, leading to spiritual and moral decline. The erasure of idol names signifies a complete removal of their influence and memory, reflecting a return to monotheistic worship. This echoes the first commandment and the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh. The land, likely referring to Israel, will be purified from these false deities.<p><b>and they will no longer be remembered.</b><br>This suggests a total eradication of idolatry, not just physically but also from the collective memory of the people. It implies a deep transformation where the allure and power of idols are utterly forgotten, aligning with the prophetic vision of a restored and faithful community.<p><b>I will also remove the prophets</b><br>The reference to prophets here is likely to false prophets who led people astray. Throughout the Old Testament, false prophets were a significant problem, often contradicting true prophetic messages. Their removal signifies the establishment of truth and the end of misleading spiritual guidance.<p><b>and the spirit of impurity from the land.</b><br>The "spirit of impurity" can be understood as the pervasive influence of sin and false worship.

The prophet names the two chief sins which had brought ruin on the old theocracy - idolatry and false prophetism, and declares that these shall not be found in the new theocracy. As these two sins were not specially prevalent after the Captivity, some see in their mention here an argument for the pre-exilian authorship of this part of Zechariah. But the prophet, grounding his message on past history, does well to give assurance that such lapses shall not happen again. Nor is it altogether certain that the warning against these errors was not needed after the return. There were false prophets in Nehemiah's time (<a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and we read in the Book of Maccabees that many Jews adopted heathen rites and customs, among which the worship of idols must have been included (1 Macc. 1:11, etc.; 2 Macc. 4:13, etc.), and the people and even priests contracted marriages with heathen wives (<a href="/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>); so that there was real danger of relapse. <span class="cmt_word">The prophets.</span> The false prophets are meant, as is evident from their being associated with idols and the unclean spirit, and from vers. 3-6.
