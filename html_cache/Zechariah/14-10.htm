Geba, located in the territory of Benjamin, and Rimmon, situated in the southern part of Judah, mark the northern and southern boundaries of this transformation. The leveling of the land into a plain symbolizes a divine intervention, often associated with the preparation for the establishment of God's kingdom. This imagery echoes prophetic themes found in <a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>, where valleys are raised and mountains made low, signifying the removal of obstacles for God's people.<p><b>but Jerusalem will be raised up and will remain in her place</b><br>Jerusalem's elevation signifies its exaltation and centrality in God's plan. This imagery of being "raised up" can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual prominence and divine favor. The city remaining in its place suggests stability and permanence, contrasting with the upheaval of the surrounding regions. This aligns with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, where Jerusalem is depicted as the highest of the mountains, drawing nations to it.<p><b>from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate to the Corner Gate</b><br>The mention of specific gates highlights the historical and geographical context of ancient Jerusalem. The Benjamin Gate, likely located on the northern side, indicates the city's connection to the tribe of Benjamin. The First Gate and the Corner Gate, though their exact locations are debated, suggest a comprehensive inclusion of the city's boundaries. These gates symbolize access and protection, reflecting the city's fortified nature as seen in Nehemiah's rebuilding efforts (<a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-32</a>).<p><b>and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses</b><br>The Tower of Hananel, mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>, was part of Jerusalem's fortifications, representing strength and vigilance. The royal winepresses indicate the city's prosperity and agricultural abundance, essential for its economy and sustenance. This combination of defense and provision underscores Jerusalem's role as a secure and thriving center in the messianic age, resonating with the imagery of peace and prosperity in <a href="/zechariah/8-12.htm">Zechariah 8:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/geba.htm">Geba</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, often considered a northern boundary marker for the kingdom of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rimmon.htm">Rimmon</a></b><br>A location south of Jerusalem, marking the southern boundary in this context.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Israel, significant in biblical prophecy and history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin_gate,_first_gate,_corner_gate.htm">Benjamin Gate, First Gate, Corner Gate</a></b><br>Specific gates of Jerusalem, indicating the city's boundaries and fortifications.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tower_of_hananel_and_royal_winepresses.htm">Tower of Hananel and Royal Winepresses</a></b><br>Landmarks within Jerusalem, symbolizing its strength and productivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_elevation_of_jerusalem.htm">The Elevation of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The prophecy of Jerusalem being raised signifies God's intention to establish His presence and authority.

The Revised Version renders, "shall be turned as the Arabah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Jordan ghor, a valley of abnormal fertility. <span class="cmt_word">From Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the north of Judah to its southern boundary. Geba was a town and district on the edge of the great Wady Suweinit, five miles north of Jerusalem. It is identified with Jeba (<a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>), and it formed the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>). Rimmon is described as "south of Jerusalem," to distinguish it from a town of the same name in Galilee (<a href="/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>), and from the famous rock Rimmon, to which the Benjamites fled (<a href="/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>). It was situated in the territory of Simeon (<a href="/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>), and has been identified with <span class="accented">Umm-er-Rummamin</span>, a town ten miles north of Beersheba. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be lifted up.</span> Jerusalem shall remain exalted on its hill, while all the country around sinks into a plain - a figure representing the spiritual exaltation of the new theocracy. <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited in her place;</span> or, <span class="accented">shall dwell in her place.</span> Shall occupy her ancient limits, and abide there safely without fear (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From Benjamin's gate,</span> etc. (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>). It is difficult to define the given boundaries with certainty in every particular. Benjamin's gate is the same as the gate of Ephraim (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>), so called as leading to the territory of Benjamin, and beyond again to that of Ephraim. It was situated in the north or second wall. From this point the course of the wall is followed, first to the west, and then to the east. <span class="cmt_word">The first gate.</span> This was in the eastern part at this wall, and is the same as "the old gate," or "gate of the old town," of <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The corner gate</span> (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>) was at the northwest corner, west of the gate of Benjamin, at the angle where the first and second walls approached each other. These dimensions would give the breadth of the city from east to west. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Hananeel</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>:l) was at the northeast corner of the north wall, where the citadel Basis or Antonia afterwards stood. <span class="cmt_word">The king's wine presses</span> were probably near "the king's garden" (<a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), at the southeast extremity of the city. They may have been cut out of the rock, as was often the case. This description gives the extent of the city from north to south. Thus Zechariah illustrates the growth and stability of the Church of God by the figure of the earthly city Jerusalem, firmly and orderly built, and inhabited by a teeming population, as the following verse shows. There is no ground for expecting the literal fulfilment of this prediction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
