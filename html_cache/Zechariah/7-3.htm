The "house of the LORD of Hosts" refers to the temple, emphasizing God's sovereignty and power. This phrase indicates a formal inquiry, showing respect for religious authority. The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's command over heavenly armies, a reminder of His ultimate authority and protection over Israel.<p><b>as well as the prophets</b><br>Prophets were God's messengers, providing guidance and correction. Their inclusion highlights the importance of seeking divine insight beyond ritualistic practices. Prophets like Haggai and Zechariah were active during this period, encouraging the rebuilding of the temple and spiritual renewal. This dual consultation with priests and prophets reflects a comprehensive approach to understanding God's will.<p><b>&#8220;Should I weep and fast in the fifth month,</b><br>The fifth month refers to the month of Av, during which the Jews commemorated the destruction of Solomon's Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC. Fasting and weeping were expressions of mourning and repentance. This practice had become a tradition during the Babylonian exile, reflecting a deep sense of loss and longing for restoration. The question implies a desire to understand whether these rituals remain necessary now that the temple is being rebuilt.<p><b>as I have done these many years?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "these many years" indicates a long-standing tradition, suggesting a period of seventy years since the temple's destruction. This reflects the persistence of mourning practices even after returning from exile. The inquiry suggests a shift in focus from ritual to understanding God's current expectations. It raises questions about the relevance of past practices in light of new circumstances, pointing to a broader theme of spiritual renewal and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in Israel's history, often associated with worship and spiritual encounters.

The temple was burnt on the ninth or tenth of the month (see <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8, 9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12, 13</a>). The only fast-day enjoined by the Law of Moses was the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month, Ethanim (<a href="/leviticus/23-26.htm">Leviticus 23:26</a>, etc.). But the Jews added others in memory of certain national events (see <a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, etc.). In <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> mention is made of four extraordinary fasts instituted and observed during the Captivity, viz. on the ninth day of the fourth month, in memory of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; in the fifth month, in remembrance of the burning of the temple and city; in the seventh month, in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</a>); and in the tenth month, in memory of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (see note on ch. 8:19). <span class="cmt_word">Separating myself.</span> Abstaining from food and pleasure. Vulgate, <span class="accented">vel sanctificare me debeo</span>, such separation or abstinence being regarded as a consecration to the Lord. The LXX. has not understood the passage, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> "The sanctification hath come in here in the fifth month." <span class="cmt_word">These so many years.</span> All the seventy years of exile. There is, perhaps, some Pharisaical complacency in this assertion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">by asking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
