In biblical context, the act of waving a hand is often symbolic of God's power and authority to execute His will. This imagery is reminiscent of God's actions in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where He stretches out His hand over Egypt to bring plagues. It indicates a decisive action by God against the enemies of His people, suggesting that their defeat is certain and orchestrated by divine power.<p><b>so that they will become plunder for their own servants</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a reversal of fortunes, where those who were once oppressors become the oppressed. Historically, this reflects the fate of nations like Babylon, which fell to the Medes and Persians, as seen in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The concept of oppressors becoming plunder is also echoed in <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>, where the captives take their captors captive. It underscores the biblical theme of divine justice and the ultimate vindication of God's people.<p><b>Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authentication of the messenger's mission and message. The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's sovereignty over the heavenly armies, underscoring His supreme authority. The phrase "has sent Me" suggests a messianic undertone, pointing to the role of Jesus Christ as the sent one, as seen in <a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>.

The phrase assures Judah that God Himself, not merely an angelic envoy, will confront the nations that scattered His people (see <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is literal and unfailing, this is not poetic exaggeration; it is a promise of real intervention&#8212;past foreshadows (the fall of Babylon, <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) and future climaxes (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>) both flow from this pledge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they will become plunder for their own servants</b><p>&#8226;

Literally, the nations that exploited Judah will hand over their wealth. Historically this began with Persia&#8217;s funding of the temple (<a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8-9</a>), and prophetically it anticipates the Messianic kingdom when &#8220;the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/14-14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle stands: God&#8217;s justice not only protects but repays, vindicating those who trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me</b><p>&#8226; Fulfilled judgment authenticates the Messenger.
