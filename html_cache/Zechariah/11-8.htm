The "three shepherds" are often interpreted as leaders or classes of leaders, such as prophets, priests, and kings, who failed in their duties. The "one month" indicates a swift and decisive action, emphasizing the urgency and severity of God's judgment. Historically, this could reflect a period of turmoil and leadership failure in Israel. The dismissal of these shepherds prefigures the rejection of corrupt leadership and points to the coming of a true shepherd, Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the perfect leader.<p><b>My soul grew impatient with the flock,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's frustration and weariness with the people of Israel due to their persistent disobedience and rebellion. The imagery of God as a shepherd reflects His care and guidance, but the people's continual waywardness leads to divine impatience. This sentiment is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>, where God expresses His weariness with Israel's sin. It underscores the theme of divine judgment and the need for repentance and renewal.<p><b>and their souls also detested me.</b><br>Here, the mutual estrangement between God and His people is emphasized. The people's detestation of God reflects their rejection of His covenant and commandments, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of Israel's repeated cycles of rebellion and repentance. The phrase also foreshadows the rejection of Jesus Christ by many of His contemporaries, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. This mutual detestation underscores the need for reconciliation through Christ, the Good Shepherd, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel.

Scripture often groups Israel&#8217;s leaders into three offices:<p>&#8211; Kings (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>)<p>&#8211; Priests (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7-8</a>)<p>&#8211; Prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13-15</a>)<p>All three offices were corrupted by Zechariah&#8217;s day, so God declared, &#8220;I will remove them&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/34-10.htm">Ezekiel 34:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Some see three specific rulers deposed rapidly (as in <a href="/bsb/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>), others the three offices abolished in effectiveness when Christ, the ultimate Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), supplanted them. Both emphases highlight God&#8217;s right to strip unfaithful leaders.<p>&#8226; The dismissal is total&#8212;no appeal, no delay&#8212;mirroring later judgment on Jerusalem&#8217;s hierarchy in A.D. 70 (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My soul grew impatient with the flock</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;soul&#8221; expresses His deepest covenantal feeling (<a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>).

The people choose to despise their own Protector (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Detested&#8221; shows deliberate rejection, prefiguring the nation&#8217;s rejection of Jesus: &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>; also <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin blinds the flock to the Shepherd&#8217;s goodness; resentment replaces reverence, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, &#8220;He was despised and rejected by men.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-8.htm">Zechariah 11:8</a> portrays a swift, severe house-cleaning. In the span of &#8220;one month&#8221; God removes three categories of corrupt shepherds, exposing leadership failures and a flock that repays divine care with contempt. The verse warns that persistent rebellion forces God to act decisively, yet it also foreshadows the coming of the one true Shepherd who alone can heal the breach between a holy God and a wayward people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - In executing the office of feeding the flock, <span class="cmt_word">three shepherds also I out off in one month;</span> Septuagint, "And I will take away the three shepherds in one month." The article in the Hebrew and Greek seems to point to some known shepherds, three in number, unless we take it as "threes of the shepherds." Hence expositors have sought to find historical personages to whom the term might apply. Those who assert a pre-exilian origin for this part of the prophecy, suggest the three kings, Zachariah, Shallum, and Menahem; or, as Menahem reigned ten years, some unrecorded pretender, who started up at the time. Others see some Syrian monarchs in Maccabean times; or the three offices, king, prophet, priest; or the three dynasties that oppressed Israel, viz. the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Macedonian. All these interpretations fail in some point; and we are reduced to see herein a reference, as Cheyne says, to "the prompt and vigorous action of Jehovah's Shepherd in dealing with the evil shepherds, as well as in feeding the flock;" the number three being used indefinitely. Or we may find in this number an allusion to the three classes in ver. 5 - the buyers, the sellers, and the pitiless shepherds. The oppressors, external and internal, are removed and cut off in one month. To the prophet's eye all this seemed to take place in that short space of time. If anything more is intended, we may, with Keil and others, taking the month as consisting of thirty days, assume that ten days are assigned to the destruction of each shepherd, after each had fulfilled his allotted period - the number ten expressing perfection or completion. <span class="cmt_word">And my soul loathed them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but my soul was straitened for them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was impatient, weary of them. These words begin a new paragraph, and refer, not to the three shepherds, but to the sheep, the Israelites. The prophet now shows how ill the people had responded to God's manifold care, and mingles with the past a view of their future ingratitude and disobedience which will bring upon them final ruin. God, as it were, was weary of their continual backslidings and obstinate perseverance in evil. (For the phrase, see <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>; <a href="/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>.)
