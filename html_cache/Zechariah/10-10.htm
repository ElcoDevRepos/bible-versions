Egypt, historically, was a place of bondage for the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression. The return from Egypt echoes the Exodus, where God delivered His people from slavery. This restoration is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting God's faithfulness and mercy. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>and gather them from Assyria.</b><br>Assyria represents another historical oppressor of Israel, known for its conquest and exile of the Northern Kingdom in 722 BC. The gathering from Assyria indicates God's power to reclaim His people from even the most formidable enemies. This act of gathering is a fulfillment of prophetic promises found in Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God assures the return of His scattered people. It underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the hope of restoration.<p><b>I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon</b><br>Gilead and Lebanon are regions known for their fertility and beauty, symbolizing abundance and blessing. Gilead, east of the Jordan River, was known for its balm, a healing ointment, suggesting restoration and healing for the people. Lebanon, with its famous cedars, represents strength and majesty. This promise of return to these lands signifies not just physical restoration but also spiritual renewal and prosperity.<p><b>until no more room is found for them.</b><br>This phrase indicates an overwhelming blessing and growth, reminiscent of the promises made to the patriarchs about their descendants being as numerous as the stars. It suggests a future time of prosperity and expansion for God's people, where the land cannot contain their numbers. This abundance is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises, pointing to the eschatological hope of a restored and flourishing kingdom under the reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>Historically, a place of bondage for the Israelites.

Besides this, Assyria is often used loosely for Western Asia or Babylonia, of which, after its submission, it formed a most important feature (see <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>; and in the Apocrypha, 1 Esdr. 7:15; Judith 1:7 Judith 2:1).
