The act of lifting one's eyes suggests readiness to receive a message from God. The presence of two women is unusual in biblical visions, as women are not typically depicted as agents of divine action. This could symbolize a break from traditional roles, emphasizing the unexpected ways God can work. The number two often signifies confirmation or witness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, where two witnesses establish a matter.<p><b>with the wind in their wings</b><br>The wind is often symbolic of the Spirit of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and <a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>. Here, it suggests divine empowerment and swiftness. The imagery of wings conveys speed and the ability to transcend earthly limitations, reminiscent of the cherubim in <a href="/ezekiel/1-6.htm">Ezekiel 1:6</a>. This phrase emphasizes the supernatural nature of the vision and the divine origin of the mission these women are undertaking.<p><b>Their wings were like those of a stork</b><br>The stork is a large bird known for its strength and migratory patterns, often associated with care and protection due to its nurturing behavior. In <a href="/leviticus/11-19.htm">Leviticus 11:19</a>, the stork is listed among unclean birds, which might imply a message of judgment or purification. The comparison to a stork highlights the power and purposefulness of the women's mission, suggesting a divine task that involves both judgment and deliverance.<p><b>and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth</b><br>The basket, previously mentioned in <a href="/zechariah/5-7.htm">Zechariah 5:7-8</a>, contains wickedness personified. The act of lifting it between heaven and earth signifies a transition or removal from the earthly realm, possibly indicating judgment or purification. This imagery connects to the concept of spiritual warfare, where forces of good and evil contend. The positioning between heaven and earth suggests divine intervention and the ultimate authority of God over both realms, echoing themes found in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

This latter supposition proceeds on the erroneous idea that wickedness is herein rescued from punishment, whereas the notion that underlies the whole vision is that the Holy Land is purged of wickedness. That the two nations hostile to Israel are represented is an untenable suggestion; for why should they carry off iniquity from Jerusalem and fix it in their own land? Probably by the two women carrying away the evil woman is signified (if the details are capable of explanation) that iniquity brings with it its own destruction and works out its own removal. <span class="cmt_word">The wind was in their wings.</span> They were borne along so quickly that they seemed to be carried by the wind; or the wind helped their flight. <span class="cmt_word">A stork;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the hoopoe;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">milvi.</span> The Authorized Version is certainly correct.

But its introduction more probably has reference to its migratory habits, the power and rapidity of its flight, and, as some think, to its skill in constructing its nest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I lifted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
