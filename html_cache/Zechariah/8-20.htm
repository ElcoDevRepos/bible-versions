The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's command over heavenly armies, reflecting His power and majesty. This introduction assures the reader that the message is not of human origin but a divine proclamation, reinforcing the certainty and importance of the prophecy.<p><b>Peoples will yet come&#8212;</b><br>This indicates a future event, suggesting hope and restoration. The term "peoples" refers to various ethnic groups and nations, highlighting the inclusivity of God's plan. This prophecy points to a time when diverse groups will seek the God of Israel, foreshadowing the New Testament's message of the Gospel reaching all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). It also echoes the Abrahamic covenant, where all nations would be blessed through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>the residents of many cities&#8212;</b><br>This phrase suggests a widespread movement, not limited to a single location. In the historical context, cities were centers of culture and influence, and their residents coming to seek God indicates a significant shift in spiritual focus. This can be seen as a precursor to the spread of Christianity, where urban centers played a crucial role in the dissemination of the Gospel (<a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>). The mention of "many cities" also implies a reversal of the dispersion and division seen at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>), pointing towards unity under God's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples.htm">Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to various groups or nations, indicating a diverse gathering beyond just the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/residents_of_many_cities.htm">Residents of many cities</a></b><br>Suggests a widespread movement of people from different urban centers, symbolizing a collective return or pilgrimage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_universal_plan.htm">God's Universal Plan</a></b><br>God's vision extends beyond Israel to include all nations, reflecting His desire for a global community of worshipers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_community.htm">The Power of Community</a></b><br>The gathering of peoples from many cities underscores the importance of community in worship and the collective pursuit of God's presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>This prophecy offers hope for restoration and unity, encouraging believers to anticipate and work towards God's ultimate plan for reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation_in_god's_mission.htm">Active Participation in God's Mission</a></b><br>Believers are called to be active participants in God's mission, inviting others to join in the journey towards Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Trust in the fulfillment of God's promises, as He has declared a future where all nations will seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Zechariah_8_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Zechariah 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_8_20_Seek_God_in_community.htm">How does Zechariah 8:20 encourage us to seek God's presence in community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_peoples_mean_for_God_s_plan.htm">What does "peoples and inhabitants" signify about God's plan for diverse worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_gather_for_prayer_today.htm">How can we implement Zechariah 8:20's call to gather for prayer today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Zech_8_20_Matt_18_20_on_worship.htm">Connect Zechariah 8:20 with Matthew 18:20 on communal worship importance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Zech_8_20_inspire_outreach.htm">How does Zechariah 8:20 inspire us to invite others to seek the Lord?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_8_20_s_prophetic_meaning.htm">What is the significance of Zechariah 8:20 in the context of biblical prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_8_20_and_biblical_pilgrimage.htm">How does Zechariah 8:20 relate to the concept of pilgrimage in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_8_20_Historical_events.htm">What historical events might Zechariah 8:20 be referencing or predicting?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_zechariah_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Zechariah 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_in_zechariah's_prophecies.htm">What are the key themes in Zechariah's prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_sacrifices_in_the_millennial_kingdom.htm">Why are animal sacrifices in the millennial kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_jerusalem_still_in_conflict.htm">Zechariah 8:8: If God promised to dwell in Jerusalem, why do historical events and conflicts still threaten its peace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_is_the_'shepherd'_in_zech._13_7.htm">Zechariah 13:7 -
