The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty over the armies of heaven and earth, a common title in prophetic literature, highlighting His supreme command and ability to fulfill His promises. This title is used frequently in the Old Testament, especially in the prophetic books, to remind the people of God's omnipotence and His role as a divine warrior.<p><b>If this is impossible in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days:</b><br>The "remnant" refers to the small group of Israelites who returned from Babylonian exile to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. This period was marked by discouragement and doubt due to the daunting task of restoration amidst opposition and limited resources. The phrase reflects the human perspective of impossibility, a common theme in Scripture where God's people face seemingly insurmountable challenges (e.g., the Israelites at the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>). The "these days" contextually refers to the post-exilic period, a time of rebuilding and renewal.<p><b>should it also be impossible in My eyes?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the people's limited perspective by contrasting it with God's limitless power. It echoes other biblical assurances of God's ability to accomplish what seems impossible to humans, such as in <a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>, where God promises Abraham and Sarah a son despite their old age. This phrase reassures the remnant that God's plans are not hindered by human limitations, emphasizing His omnipotence and faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>declares the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The repetition of "LORD of Hosts" at the end of the verse reinforces the authority and certainty of the message. It serves as a divine seal, assuring the people that the promise comes from the highest authority. This declaration is a common prophetic formula, used to affirm the truth and reliability of God's word, as seen throughout the prophetic books, ensuring the audience of the divine origin and unchangeable nature of the promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_this_people.htm">The Remnant of This People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who returned from Babylonian exile, representing those who remained faithful and were preserved by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_days.htm">Those Days</a></b><br>The period of restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, encouraging them during the rebuilding process.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city central to Jewish identity and worship, undergoing restoration in the context of this prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to accomplish His purposes, even when circumstances seem insurmountable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Encourage believers to hold fast to God's promises, knowing that He is faithful and able to fulfill them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perspective_on_impossibilities.htm">Perspective on Impossibilities</a></b><br>Challenge believers to view their challenges through the lens of God's power rather than human limitations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_times_of_restoration.htm">Encouragement in Times of Restoration</a></b><br>Offer hope to those in a season of rebuilding or restoration, reminding them of God's past faithfulness and future promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_remnant.htm">Community and Remnant</a></b><br>Highlight the importance of being part of the faithful remnant, committed to God's purposes and plans.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Zechariah_8_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Zechariah 8:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_8_6_Faith_in_God_s_promises.htm">How does Zechariah 8:6 encourage faith in God's power to fulfill promises?
