In <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, Christ is depicted riding a white horse, symbolizing His ultimate victory and righteousness. The presence of white horses in Zechariah's vision may suggest a message of triumph and the establishment of God's kingdom. Historically, white horses were prized in ancient cultures for their beauty and rarity, often associated with royalty and military leaders. This imagery would resonate with the original audience, conveying a sense of hope and divine intervention.<p><b>and the fourth dappled horses</b><br>Dappled horses, with their mixed colors, can symbolize a combination of judgment and mercy. The dappled appearance may suggest a blending of different divine purposes or actions. In the context of Zechariah's visions, these horses could represent a complex mission involving both blessing and judgment. The dappled horses might also be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies both justice and grace. The mixed colors could indicate the multifaceted nature of God's plans and the diverse ways He interacts with the world.<p><b>&#8212;all of them strong.</b><br>The emphasis on the strength of the horses underscores the power and authority of God's messengers. In biblical times, horses were symbols of military might and strength, often used in warfare. The description of these horses as strong indicates their readiness and capability to carry out God's will. This strength assures the audience of God's sovereign control over the events being depicted. The strength of the horses also points to the unstoppable nature of God's purposes, reinforcing the message of divine assurance and the fulfillment of prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

out &#8220;from between two mountains of bronze&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1&#8211;2</a>). Scripture treats these chariots as real heavenly agents&#8212;angelic messengers dispatched by the LORD to patrol the earth, just as the earlier horses did in <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8&#8211;11</a>.<p>&#8226; Each chariot is drawn by horses of a distinct color, and each color signals a particular mission. Because the passage reports what Zechariah actually saw, we take the vision at face value: literal horses in a literal vision, symbolizing literal assignments from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The third white horses</b><p>&#8220;the third white horses&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>)<p>&#8226; White in Scripture regularly points to purity and victorious triumph&#8212;think of the conquering Christ on a &#8220;white horse&#8221; in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a> or the riders sent out in <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>.<p>&#8226; Here, the third chariot&#8217;s white horses signify a mission of peaceful victory.
