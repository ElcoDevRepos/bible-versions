This question reflects his desire for understanding and clarity regarding the vision he is witnessing. The term "my lord" indicates respect and recognition of authority, often used in addressing angels or divine messengers. This scene is part of a series of visions given to Zechariah to encourage the Jewish people rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem. The question signifies the human need for divine interpretation and guidance, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>And the angel who was speaking with me replied,</b><br>Angels often serve as intermediaries between God and humans in the Bible, delivering messages and providing explanations. This particular angel is a guide for Zechariah, similar to the role of angels in the visions of Daniel and John in Revelation. The presence of the angel underscores the divine origin of the vision and the importance of the message being conveyed. It also highlights the accessibility of divine wisdom through God's appointed messengers.<p><b>&#8220;I will show you what they are.&#8221;</b><br>The angel's response promises revelation and understanding, emphasizing God's willingness to reveal His plans to those who seek Him. This assurance of explanation is a common motif in prophetic literature, where God provides insight into His purposes and future events. The phrase suggests a progressive revelation, where understanding unfolds as God deems appropriate. It also points to the role of prophecy in unveiling divine mysteries, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament prophets to the New Testament revelations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah is the author of the book and the one receiving the visions.

He does not wait passively; he initiates dialogue (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb underscores the reality of the conversation&#8212;this is not a metaphor but a literal encounter recorded for our instruction (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Asking leads to understanding; God welcomes it when His people seek clarification rather than remain in confusion (cf. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"And the angel who was speaking with me replied,"</b><p>&#8226; The same angel who guided the vision now interprets it, displaying God&#8217;s gracious provision of both revelation and explanation (cf. <a href="/daniel/9-22.htm">Daniel 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Angels serve as ministering spirits for believers (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>) and, in prophetic literature, often convey divine insight (cf. <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The continuity of the speaker reassures Zechariah&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s guidance is consistent, not fragmented (cf. <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"I will show you what they are."</b><p>&#8226; God does not leave mysteries unresolved for those who seek Him; revelation follows inquiry (cf. <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise to &#8220;show&#8221; anticipates the detailed explanation in verses 10&#8211;11 of the riders sent to patrol the earth, confirming God&#8217;s active oversight of the nations.<p>&#8226; This assurance underlines the larger message of the book: God remembers His covenant people and is moving history toward His ordained outcome (cf. <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a> captures a living dialogue: the prophet asks, the angel answers, and understanding unfolds. The passage invites believers to approach Scripture with respectful curiosity, confident that God provides both revelation and interpretation through His Word and His messengers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my lord.</span> The prophet speaks to the angel of the Lord, who answers briefly, and is succeeded by the interpreting angel. <span class="cmt_word">What are these?</span> Not "who," but "what;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what do they signify?

Hence some regard the expression as intimating a communication berne inwardly to the soul without the aid of external organs, or that the angel overpowered and influenced the prophet as the evil spirit possessed the demoniac. But the same term is used, as Dr. Wright points out, in the sense of to commune with a person (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6, 8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a>), and to speak to a person (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; and perhaps <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may, however, be that the angel of the Lord presented matters objectively, and the prophet's own angel interpreted subjectively. But the Authorized Version is probably correct. <span class="cmt_word">I will show thee.</span> This he does through the chief angel (ver. 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are these,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my lord?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
