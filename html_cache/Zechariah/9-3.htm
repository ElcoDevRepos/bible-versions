Historically, Tyre was divided into two parts: the mainland city and the island city, which was heavily fortified. The phrase highlights Tyre's self-reliance and pride in its defenses. The city's fortifications were considered nearly impregnable, which is significant in understanding the prophecy against it. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human pride and reliance on earthly strength, which is often contrasted with reliance on God (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>).<p><b>she has heaped up silver like dust,</b><br>Tyre was renowned for its wealth, largely due to its extensive trade networks across the Mediterranean. The imagery of silver being as common as dust emphasizes the immense wealth and prosperity of the city. This accumulation of wealth is often seen in the Bible as a potential source of corruption and idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/28-4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>). The wealth of Tyre is also a reminder of the transient nature of earthly riches, as seen in the eventual downfall of the city.<p><b>and gold like the dirt of the streets.</b><br>The comparison of gold to dirt underscores the abundance of wealth in Tyre, suggesting that gold was as plentiful as the very ground people walked on. This hyperbolic expression serves to illustrate the city's opulence and the potential moral decay that can accompany such material excess. In biblical literature, gold often symbolizes purity and value, but here it is depicted as commonplace, indicating a devaluation of what is truly precious. This can be connected to Jesus' teachings on the dangers of wealth and the importance of storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and strong fortifications.

History confirms the literal accuracy of Scripture here: Alexander the Great needed a causeway to breach those defenses. Yet the Lord had already called out Tyre&#8217;s pride centuries earlier.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel had prophesied, &#8220;They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>), showing that no human fortress can stand against God&#8217;s decree.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221; Tyre trusted in stone and sea rather than in the Lord, setting herself up for judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She has heaped up silver like dust</b><p>Tyre&#8217;s merchants trafficked in everything from purple dye to precious metals, piling up wealth until it seemed as common as the desert sand.

Tyre built walls, stacked silver, and piled gold, yet none of it could shield her from the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand.

The city was built partly on the mainland, and partly on an island nearly half a mile distant, which rose abruptly out of the water in rocky precipices, and was surrounded with walls a hundred and fifty feet high. The insular portion of the town was that which so long mocked the Macedonian's utmost efforts, which were only successful when he had united the island to the mainland by erecting an enormous mole between them.
