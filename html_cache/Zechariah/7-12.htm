Flint is a hard stone, suggesting an unyielding and impenetrable attitude. In biblical context, a hardened heart often signifies rebellion against God (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). This imagery is used to describe the Israelites' refusal to heed God's commands, reflecting a spiritual insensitivity and unwillingness to repent.<p><b>and would not listen to the law</b><br>The law refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's commandments and instructions for His people. The Israelites' refusal to listen indicates a rejection of God's covenant and guidance. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the people often turn away from God's statutes, leading to consequences (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>or to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets</b><br>The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power. The prophets were God's messengers, inspired by the Holy Spirit to deliver His words. This phrase highlights the divine origin of the prophetic messages and the people's disregard for them. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel warned Israel of the consequences of their disobedience, yet they were often ignored or persecuted (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>).<p><b>Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts</b><br>God's anger is a response to persistent disobedience and rejection of His word. This anger is not arbitrary but a just reaction to the covenant violations by His people. The consequences of this anger were often manifested in the form of judgment, such as exile or destruction (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>).
