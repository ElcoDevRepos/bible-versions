The "sea of distress" symbolizes overwhelming challenges or trials. In biblical context, seas often represent chaos or obstacles that God&#8217;s people must overcome. This passage reassures that God will lead His people through their trials, just as He did during the Exodus. It also reflects the spiritual journey of believers who face tribulations but are guided by divine providence.<p><b>and strike the waves of the sea;</b><br>The act of striking the waves suggests divine intervention and control over nature, reminiscent of Moses parting the Red Sea. This demonstrates God's power to subdue chaos and create a path for His people. It signifies the authority of God over creation and His ability to remove barriers that hinder His people's progress. This imagery is also seen in Jesus calming the storm in the Gospels, showing His divine authority.<p><b>all the depths of the Nile will dry up.</b><br>The drying up of the Nile, Egypt's lifeline, symbolizes the removal of reliance on earthly powers and resources. Historically, the Nile was crucial for Egypt's agriculture and economy. This prophecy indicates a divine judgment against Egypt, a traditional oppressor of Israel. It also reflects God's ability to disrupt natural and political systems to fulfill His purposes. This echoes the plagues of Egypt, where God demonstrated His supremacy over Egyptian gods and nature.<p><b>The pride of Assyria will be brought down,</b><br>Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military might and oppression of Israel. The phrase indicates a humbling of Assyria's arrogance and power. Biblically, pride often precedes downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>. This prophecy assures that God will bring justice and humble those who exalt themselves against Him and His people. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His commitment to protect and vindicate His people.<p><b>and the scepter of Egypt will depart.</b><br>The scepter symbolizes authority and rule. The departure of Egypt's scepter signifies the end of its dominance and influence. Historically, Egypt was a significant power and often a threat or temptation for Israel. This prophecy foretells the decline of Egypt's power, aligning with God's plan to establish His kingdom. It underscores the theme of divine retribution and the eventual triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers. This also points to the ultimate reign of Christ, who will establish a kingdom that surpasses all earthly dominions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_distress.htm">The Sea of Distress</a></b><br>Symbolic of the trials and tribulations faced by God's people.

This is the general meaning of the passage; but the details present difficulties. For "he shall pass" the LXX. gives, "they shall pass through." But the reference is plainly to Jehovah, as the following clause shows. The next two words are in apposition, "the sea," "affliction." Revised Version, "the sea of affliction;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in a strait sea;" or, as the Hebrew cannot be so translated, "in a sea, a strait;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in maris freto.</span> It seems best to take the two words simply as, "the sea, which is affliction." The Red Sea, through which Jehovah led his people, was a figure of the sufferings which they had endured in Egypt, and brought destruction upon their enemies (comp. <a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 17, 24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Smite the waves</span> (<a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15, 16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river.</span> The Nile. The drying up of the waters of the Nile is a figure of the humiliation of the nations which have been guilty of enslaving the chosen people. The Nile. the representative of Egypt, is mentioned because of the allusion to the bondage in Egypt running through the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">The pride of Assyria.</span> Pride is noted as the characteristic of Assyria (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre.</span> This may refer to the decadence of the power of Egypt, and the transference of royal authority to strangers; but, regarding the immediate context, we had better translate, "the rod of Egypt," and see in it an allusion to the oppression of the taskmasters during the sojourn in that land.
