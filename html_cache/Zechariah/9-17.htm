It emphasizes the transformation and renewal that will occur under God's blessing. The beauty and loveliness can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and the restoration of Israel. This echoes the prophetic visions of restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3-5</a>, where Israel is described as a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord. The language of beauty and loveliness also points to the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the church is presented as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.<p><b>Grain will make the young men flourish,</b><br>Grain symbolizes sustenance and prosperity. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, grain was a staple food and a sign of economic stability. The flourishing of young men indicates strength, vitality, and growth, suggesting a time of peace and abundance. This imagery is reminiscent of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, where the fruit of the ground and the increase of livestock are signs of God's favor. The flourishing of the young men can also be seen as a type of the spiritual growth and strength found in Christ, who is the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and new wine, the young women.</b><br>New wine represents joy, celebration, and the blessings of God. In biblical times, wine was often associated with festivity and divine favor. The mention of young women flourishing with new wine suggests a time of joy and prosperity for the entire community. This imagery connects to the promise of new wine in <a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a>, where God promises to send grain, new wine, and oil as a sign of restoration. The new wine can also be seen as a type of the new covenant in Christ's blood, which brings joy and salvation to believers (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during the post-exilic period.

Revised Version margin, "their prosperity." If the affix "his" is referred to Jehovah, the nouns "goodness" and "beauty" must be taken, not as his attributes, but as gifts bestowed by him, the prosperity and beauty which he confers. But it is more suitable to the context to consider the reference to be to the people, who in the next clause are divided into young men and maidens, and to take the "goodness," or goodliness, as appertaining more especially to the former, and the "beauty" to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">His beauty</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>).
