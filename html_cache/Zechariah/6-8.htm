In the context of biblical prophecy, such divine summons are significant as they underscore the authority and authenticity of the message. The role of a prophet in the Old Testament was to be a mouthpiece for God, delivering His messages to the people. This divine communication is consistent with other prophetic experiences, such as those of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>), where God directly calls and instructs His prophets.<p><b>Behold</b><br>The use of "Behold" serves as an attention-grabbing device, emphasizing the importance of the message that follows. It is a common biblical term used to draw the listener or reader's focus to a significant revelation or event. This word often precedes visions or divine actions that have profound implications, as seen in other prophetic books like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>) and Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).<p><b>those going to the land of the north</b><br>The "land of the north" typically refers to Babylon in the context of Zechariah's time. Historically, Babylon was a major power to the north of Israel and Judah, and it was the location of the Jewish exile following the Babylonian conquest. The phrase "those going" could refer to the angelic beings or forces described earlier in <a href="/zechariah/6.htm">Zechariah 6</a>, who are sent to patrol the earth. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His use of angelic messengers to execute His will, as seen in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> and <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>.<p><b>have given rest to My Spirit in the land of the north</b><br>This phrase suggests that the actions of those sent to the north have fulfilled God's purpose, bringing a sense of completion or satisfaction to His Spirit. The concept of God's Spirit finding rest is significant, as it implies the cessation of divine wrath or judgment, possibly indicating a shift towards restoration and peace. This can be connected to the broader theme of God's Spirit in the Old Testament, which is often associated with creation, judgment, and renewal (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>). The idea of rest also echoes the Sabbath principle, where rest signifies completion and fulfillment of divine purpose (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period who received visions from God, including the one in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (He)</a></b><br>The speaker in the vision, who communicates with Zechariah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_north.htm">The Land of the North</a></b><br>Often associated with Babylon, representing the enemies of Israel and a place of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_chariots.htm">The Four Chariots</a></b><br>Earlier in <a href="/bsb/zechariah/6.htm">Zechariah 6</a>, these chariots are described as going out to the four corners of the earth, symbolizing God's sovereign judgment and control.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>Represents God's presence and power, which finds rest when His purposes are fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's control over nations and history is evident.

This underscores the certainty of divine revelation (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The spoken word drives home that the vision is not a mere symbol but a real announcement of God&#8217;s action (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Behold,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; A divine &#8220;attention-getter,&#8221; urging Zechariah&#8212;and us&#8212;to stop and notice something pivotal (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals that what follows is both surprising and reassuring, like <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>: &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God&#8230;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those going to the land of the north</b><p>&#8226; The black horses/chariot had just &#8220;headed toward the land of the north&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a>). In Zechariah&#8217;s day, &#8220;north&#8221; points to Babylon, Israel&#8217;s longstanding oppressor (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s agents (angelic horsemen) move out to execute His purpose, echoing earlier visions where riders patrolled the earth (<a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;North&#8221; also recalls the call, &#8220;Come, Zion!

The expedition of the chariots brings that anger to a close.<p>&#8226; Rest does not imply weariness in God but completion of purpose, much like <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a> when God &#8220;rested&#8221; after creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of the north.</b><p>&#8226; The repetition drives home that the very place of Israel&#8217;s exile is the place where God finishes His judgment.<p>&#8226; Just as Babylon once seemed unstoppable, now it is the scene of divine closure (<a href="/jeremiah/50-9.htm">Jeremiah 50:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The vision assures the returned exiles that God has not forgotten justice, and His Spirit is now free to comfort and rebuild (<a href="/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/6-8.htm">Zechariah 6:8</a> closes the vision of the four chariots with God personally announcing that the agents sent toward Babylon have completed their mission.

For the remnant in Judah, this means assurance of divine justice, freedom from lingering wrath, and confidence that the same God who judged Babylon will faithfully restore His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then cried he upon me.</span> The angel cried aloud (like a herald announcing a proclamation, <a href="/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>), to call the prophet's attention to what was coming, which was of most immediate consequence to his people.

Many commentators take the clause as equivalent to "have caused my wrath to rest upon the land" (comp. <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>), referring to <a href="/judges/8-3.htm">Judges 8:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, for the use of the word "spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) in the sense of "anger." Others see here an intimation of mercy and grace to the Jews still resident in Babylonia. But it is plain that the vision is one of judgment: and the Spirit of the Lord is a Spirit of judgment and vengeance (<a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>), which destroys evil that good may flourish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [the LORD] summoned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yaz&#183;&#8216;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
