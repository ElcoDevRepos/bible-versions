The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's command over the heavenly armies, indicating His supreme power and authority. This imagery is consistent with other Old Testament passages where God is depicted as a shield for His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>). The context of <a href="/zechariah/9.htm">Zechariah 9</a> is a prophecy of deliverance and victory for Israel, suggesting that God Himself will ensure their safety against their enemies.<p><b>They will destroy and conquer with slingstones;</b><br>The use of "slingstones" evokes the image of David defeating Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>), symbolizing victory through seemingly weak or humble means. This suggests that the victory will not come through conventional military might but through God's empowerment of His people. Historically, slingstones were a common weapon in ancient warfare, and their mention here underscores the idea of divine intervention enabling success against formidable foes.<p><b>they will drink and roar as with wine.</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of exuberant celebration and triumph. The imagery of drinking and roaring like those intoxicated with wine suggests overwhelming joy and victory. In the cultural context, wine is often associated with celebration and abundance (e.g., <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). This could also symbolize the spiritual intoxication of being filled with the Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13-15</a>, where the apostles are accused of being drunk due to their boldness and joy.<p><b>And they will be filled like sprinkling bowls,</b><br>Sprinkling bowls were used in temple rituals for purification and offerings (<a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>). Being "filled like sprinkling bowls" suggests a state of being consecrated or set apart for a holy purpose. This imagery indicates that the people will be filled with God's presence and blessings, prepared for His service. It also points to the idea of spiritual fullness and satisfaction found in God.<p><b>drenched like the corners of the altar.</b><br>The corners of the altar were places where blood from sacrifices was poured, symbolizing atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>). Being "drenched like the corners of the altar" suggests a complete and thorough consecration to God. This imagery connects to the sacrificial system, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood provides atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). It signifies a deep spiritual renewal and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority to protect and deliver His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The recipients of God's protection and empowerment, symbolizing the faithful who trust in God's deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slingstones.htm">Slingstones</a></b><br>A metaphor for the tools or means by which God&#8217;s people will achieve victory, reminiscent of David's victory over Goliath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Represents the place of sacrifice and worship, indicating that the victory and subsequent joy are acts of divine service and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_deliverance.htm">The Event of Deliverance</a></b><br>This passage anticipates a future time of divine intervention where God will protect and empower His people against their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection.htm">God's Protection</a></b><br>Trust in the LORD of Hosts as our shield and defender.

He is not a distant observer but an active protector, surrounding them the way <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a> describes: &#8220;You, O LORD, are a shield about me.&#8221; Picture a fortified wall that no enemy can penetrate&#8212;<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> calls Him &#8220;my fortress,&#8221; while <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> promises &#8220;a wall of fire around&#8221; Jerusalem. The assurance is unqualified; if &#8220;God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). Believers today rest in the same safeguarding power, &#8220;kept by the power of God through faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will destroy and conquer with slingstones</b><p>The phrase evokes the unlikely weapon that brought down Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;50</a>). Slingstones suggest ordinary tools placed in consecrated hands, showing victory depends on the Lord, not on human strength. <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a> proves slingers could be remarkably accurate; here, that accuracy underscores decisive triumph. Zechariah had just pictured Judah as God&#8217;s &#8220;bow&#8221; against Greece (9:13); now he adds the sling, highlighting variety in God-ordained means. For the church, the principle endures: &#8220;The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will drink and roar as with wine</b><p>After victory comes exuberant celebration. <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a> foretells enemies feeding &#8220;on their own flesh&#8221; and becoming &#8220;intoxicated with their own blood,&#8221; an image of total rout. <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a> likens God&#8217;s awakening to &#8220;a warrior overcome by wine,&#8221; roaring into battle. The roaring here is joyful, not reckless&#8212;like a triumphant shout echoing through campfires. The battle is won; the people are jubilant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they will be filled like sprinkling bowls</b><p>Sprinkling bowls in the temple caught sacrificial blood for atonement (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5&#8211;7</a>). To be &#8220;filled&#8221; like these vessels means the nation will be saturated with the benefits of God&#8217;s victory&#8212;cleansing, consecration, and fellowship. It is as though every worshipper now overflows with the proof that sin has been dealt with and communion restored. Peter echoes the imagery when he speaks of believers chosen &#8220;for sprinkling with His blood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drenched like the corners of the altar</b><p>Blood was smeared on the altar&#8217;s horns, symbolizing complete atonement (<a href="/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>). Zechariah says the people themselves will be as thoroughly covered&#8212;evidence of both sacrifice accepted and covenant renewed. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> reminds us that &#8220;without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness,&#8221; and here we see forgiveness lavishly applied, the very corners dripping.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a> paints a vivid, literal tableau of God&#8217;s intervening power: He shields His people, equips them with surprising instruments for decisive victory, fills them with exuberant joy, and saturates them in covenant-cleansing grace. The passage moves from protection to triumph to celebration to consecration, assuring every believer that the God who fought for Judah still defends, empowers, and sanctifies all who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall defend them;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "shall put his shield over them" (Septuagint). There are numerous examples, in the Books of Maccabees, of God's special interposition in his people's favour, and thus far and in part fulfilling this prophecy (see 1 Macc. 3:16-24 1 Macc. 4:6-16 1 Macc. 7:40-50; 2 Macc. 2:21, 22 2Macc. 3:24, etc.; 5:2-4; 11:8; 12:11,15, 22, 28, 37; 15:7, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They shall devour.</span> The prophet seems to have had in view <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>, where Israel is compared to a lion, eating of the prey and drinking the blood of the slain. So here he says they shall "devour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flesh of their enemies (comp. <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Subdue with sling stones.</span> So the Vulgate, and virtually the Septuagint, taking the case of the noun as instrumental; but it is best to take it as accusative of the object, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, "They shall tread down the stones of the sling." The "slingstones" are the enemies, as in the next verse "the stones of a crown" are the Jews; and the sentence means that the Jews shall tread their enemies underfoot like spent slingstones, which are of no account. Or it may signify simply and without metaphor that they shall despise the enemies' missiles, which shall fall harmless among them (<a href="/job/41-28.htm">Job 41:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall drink</span> the blood of the slain, like lions. <span class="cmt_word">Make a noise.</span> As men exhilarated with wine. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Bibentes inebriabuntur quasi a vino</span> (<a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be filled like bowls.</span> They shall be filled with blood like the sacrificial vessels in which the blood of victims was received (<a href="/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar.</span> The blood was also sprinkled on the corners or sides of the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>). There may be included the notion that the war against God's enemies was a sacred war, and accepted by him as a sacrifice. In the Maccabean struggle the bloodshed was often very considerable (see 1 Macc. 7:32, 46 1 Macc. 11:47; 2 Macc. 8:30 2Macc. 10:17, 23, 31, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will shield</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1598.htm">Strong's 1598: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cover, surround, defend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
