The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often considered a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This angel acts as an intermediary between God and humanity, highlighting the divine concern for the world. The interaction suggests a heavenly council, where divine messengers report back to a central figure, reminiscent of <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-7</a>.<p><b>who was standing among the myrtle trees</b><br>Myrtle trees are evergreen shrubs native to the Mediterranean region, symbolizing peace and prosperity. Their presence in the vision may represent the hope of restoration for Israel. The location among the myrtle trees suggests a setting of renewal and divine favor, contrasting with the desolation of the Babylonian exile. This imagery connects to <a href="/isaiah/55-13.htm">Isaiah 55:13</a>, where myrtle replaces thorns, symbolizing transformation and blessing.<p><b>&#8220;We have patrolled the earth</b><br>The act of patrolling indicates a comprehensive survey of the earth, suggesting God's omniscience and sovereignty. This patrol reflects the divine oversight and the readiness to intervene in human affairs. It echoes the role of divine watchers in <a href="/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, who observe and report on earthly matters, ensuring that God's purposes are fulfilled.<p><b>and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.&#8221;</b><br>The report of rest and tranquility indicates a period of peace, possibly referring to the Pax Persiana under the Persian Empire, which allowed the return of the Jewish exiles. However, this peace is superficial, as it does not reflect the spiritual and moral state of the nations. The tranquility contrasts with the turmoil experienced by Israel, highlighting the tension between divine promises and current realities. This peace foreshadows the ultimate peace brought by the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, where Christ is the Prince of Peace who establishes true and lasting tranquility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often seen as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ in the Old Testament, standing among the myrtle trees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_myrtle_trees.htm">The Myrtle Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic of peace and restoration, these trees are located in a vision that Zechariah receives, representing the humble state of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_patrol.htm">The Patrol</a></b><br>Refers to the horsemen sent by God to survey the earth, reporting back on the state of the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The focus of the patrol's report, described as being at rest and tranquil, indicating a temporary peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The prophet receiving this vision, tasked with encouraging the Israelites during the post-exilic period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The vision underscores God's control over the earth, even when it appears to be at rest.

Their obedience shows a well-ordered angelic host, much like the &#8220;mighty ones who do His word&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>). Similar glimpses of mounted messengers appear when Elisha&#8217;s servant&#8217;s eyes are opened&#8212;&#8220;he saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Revelation also pictures riders sent out by God&#8217;s command (<a href="/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1-8</a>). The scene reminds us that the invisible realm is active and that God&#8217;s servants report back exactly what He assigns them to see.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the angel of the LORD</b><p>This unique figure is more than a created angel; the text treats Him as divine yet distinct from the LORD of hosts (compare <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>). Past appearances include the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>) and the call of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-14</a>). Here He receives the riders&#8217; report, underscoring His role as Commander of Heaven&#8217;s armies and the personal presence of God among His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was standing among the myrtle trees</b><p>Myrtles grow low and fragrant, often in valleys. The angel&#8217;s position &#8220;among&#8221; them pictures the LORD standing with His humbled nation, still in the low place of post-exile weakness. Myrtle imagery elsewhere points to restoration and blessing: &#8220;Instead of the briar the myrtle will grow&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-13.htm">Isaiah 55:13</a>). Nehemiah&#8217;s builders gathered myrtle branches for booths (<a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>), celebrating renewed fellowship with God. Even when Israel feels small, the Lord is right there in the midst.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We have patrolled the earth</b><p>The riders confirm a completed mission. Their ranging echoes the dialog in Job, where the adversary says, &#8220;From roaming through the earth and walking back and forth in it&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>). Unlike Satan&#8217;s prowling, these scouts serve God&#8217;s protective watch: &#8220;The eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>). Nothing escapes His notice; His people may rest knowing heaven&#8217;s cavalry keeps watch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>, and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.&#8221;</b><p>The report sounds positive&#8212;Persia&#8217;s empire currently enjoys peace&#8212;yet it sets up a tension. The nations are &#8220;at ease,&#8221; but Jerusalem&#8217;s walls are still rubble and her temple only half rebuilt. The same contrast appears when Isaiah foretells a day the &#8220;whole earth is at rest and quiet&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>) while God&#8217;s people await full deliverance. Haggai addressed this complacency&#8212;&#8220;Is it a time for you yourselves to live in paneled houses while this house lies in ruins?&#8221; (<a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>). The calm on earth is temporary; true, lasting peace will come only when the LORD vindicates Zion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a> reveals a heavenly reconnaissance confirming global calm under Persian rule, yet that very calm highlights Judah&#8217;s unfinished restoration. The riders&#8217; orderly report to the angel of the LORD assures us that God&#8217;s messengers are active, His presence is among the lowly, His knowledge is complete, and His plan for Zion is moving forward even when the world seems settled and unconcerned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered.</span> Having said who they were, the angel directs them to tell of their doings. <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord.</span> The "man riding upon the red horse" (ver. 8) is now called "the Angel of Jehovah." This term is usually held to denote a manifestation of the Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, assuming an angelic form or imparting his immediate presence to the revealer of his will. <span class="cmt_word">Sitteth still, and is at rest.</span> The world was lying in proud security. There was no sign of that shaking of nations which Haggai (<a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7, 21, 22</a>) had foretold should precede the coming of Messiah and the restoration of Israel. In this second year of Darius, the empire, though suffering from internal disturbances, was outwardly at peace, and was threatened by no enemy at a distance. But the condition of the Jews was sad and disheartening; the temple still unbuilt, the walls of Jerusalem lying in ruins, themselves only a small remnant, exposed to the insults and attacks of jealous neighbours, living on sufferance as subjects of a heathen power, and no sign of the predicted salvation appearing, - this was their state.
