The Levites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and later the temple, serving as priests and assistants in worship. This phrase highlights the inclusion of the priestly class in the mourning described in <a href="/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>, indicating a national repentance that includes all societal levels. The mention of "their wives" emphasizes the communal and familial nature of this repentance, suggesting that the spiritual renewal involves entire households. This aligns with the biblical theme of collective responsibility and repentance seen in passages like <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a> and <a href="/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15-17</a>.<p><b>the clan of Shimei and their wives</b><br>Shimei is a less prominent figure, and the specific reference here may relate to a particular family within the tribe of Levi. Shimei was a common name in the Old Testament, and one notable Shimei was a member of the tribe of Benjamin who cursed King David (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). However, in this context, it likely refers to a Levitical family, possibly a subdivision within the Levites. The inclusion of Shimei's clan underscores the comprehensive nature of the mourning and repentance, extending beyond the more prominent priestly families to include lesser-known groups. This reflects the biblical principle that God's call to repentance and renewal is universal, reaching every part of the community, as seen in the inclusive language of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God's Spirit is poured out on all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_levi.htm">House of Levi</a></b><br>The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and temple service.
