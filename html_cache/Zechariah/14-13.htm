It is a future event when God will decisively act in history. This concept is found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, and is often associated with both judgment and salvation.<p><b>a great panic from the LORD will come upon them</b><br>The panic is divinely induced, suggesting God's direct involvement in the events. This mirrors other biblical instances where God causes confusion among enemies, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a> during the crossing of the Red Sea and in <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a> with Gideon's battle against the Midianites. The panic serves as a tool for divine judgment, emphasizing God's sovereignty over human affairs.<p><b>so that each will seize the hand of another</b><br>This phrase indicates a breakdown of social order and unity among the people. It reflects a state of chaos and distrust, where alliances and friendships dissolve under pressure. This internal conflict is reminiscent of the curses described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>, where disobedience to God leads to confusion and disorder.<p><b>and the hand of one will rise against the other</b><br>This internal strife is a common motif in biblical prophecy, where God uses internal conflict as a means of judgment. It echoes the civil discord seen in <a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a>, where God promises to set Egyptians against each other. This phrase highlights the self-destructive nature of sin and rebellion against God, leading to societal collapse.<br><br>The entire verse underscores the theme of divine judgment and the futility of human alliances when opposed to God's will. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance, urging readers to align themselves with God's purposes to avoid such chaos and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine initiator of the events described, emphasizing His sovereignty and power over the nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to the nations gathered against Jerusalem, experiencing the panic and confusion sent by the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of the prophetic events, representing God's chosen city and His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A prophetic event characterized by divine intervention, judgment, and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/panic.htm">Panic</a></b><br>A divinely induced confusion and fear that causes disarray among the enemies of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, including the actions of nations and individuals.

Scripture repeatedly shows God throwing hostile armies into confusion:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Panic struck the whole army&#8230; It was a panic sent by God&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;When Gideon&#8217;s three hundred blew the trumpets, the LORD set the men&#8217;s swords against one another&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir&#8230; and they were defeated&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>Zechariah assures us the same sovereign hand will unleash dread that unravels the final coalition attacking Jerusalem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that each will seize the hand of another</b><p>Here the panic becomes personal&#8212;soldiers grope for any steadying grip, yet even that grasp turns hostile.
