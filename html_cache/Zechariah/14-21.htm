In biblical times, holiness was often associated with the temple and its sacred objects. This prophecy suggests a future where the distinction between sacred and secular is removed, indicating a time of complete holiness and dedication to God. This echoes the idea found in <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>, where holiness to the Lord is inscribed on the high priest's turban, symbolizing total devotion.<p><b>and all who sacrifice will come and take some pots and cook in them</b><br>This indicates a democratization of worship, where all people, not just priests, have access to sacred items for sacrificial purposes. It reflects a future where worship is inclusive and accessible, aligning with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, which speaks of God's house being a house of prayer for all nations. The act of cooking in these pots symbolizes fellowship and communion with God, reminiscent of the communal meals shared in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>).<p><b>And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The term "Canaanite" here can be understood as a metaphor for impurity or those who are not in covenant with God. Historically, Canaanites were the inhabitants of the land before Israel's conquest, often associated with idolatry and immorality. This prophecy envisions a purified community of believers, echoing the vision in <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>, where nothing impure will enter the New Jerusalem.

The word is used in the sense of "trafficker," or "merchant," in Job 40:30 (Job 41:6, Authorized Version); <a href="/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a> (comp. <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>). If any vessel might now be used in God's service, worshippers would no longer be obliged to buy special bowls from those who sold in the temple courts (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>). But it is best in agreement with the context to take "Canaanite" to mean any unclean or profane person (comp. <a href="/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, etc.). Thus Daniel, in the History of Susanna, ver. 56, addresses the wicked elder, "Thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Jude;" and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>) calls the chiefs of Israel "rulers of Sodom," and "people of Gomorrah." Henceforward the "people shall be all righteous" (<a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>). There shall be one, holy, Catholic Church. Thus the vision of the golden candlestick (ch. 4.) is fulfilled; and that this should come to pass is the design of God's manifold providences and operations (comp. <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>;
