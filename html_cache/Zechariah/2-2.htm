The speaker is Zechariah, a prophet during the post-exilic period when the Israelites were returning from Babylonian captivity. The question reflects a desire to understand God's plans and purposes. In biblical narratives, questions often precede divine revelations or significant actions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> when God asks Adam, "Where are you?" This inquiry sets the stage for a revelation about Jerusalem's future.<p><b>&#8220;To measure Jerusalem,&#8221; he replied,</b><br>The act of measuring signifies preparation and intention. In ancient times, measuring a city was often associated with construction or restoration, indicating a divine plan for rebuilding. This echoes the vision in <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-42</a>, where a man measures the temple, symbolizing restoration and hope. Measuring also implies ownership and protection, suggesting God's commitment to Jerusalem's future. Theologically, it points to God's precise and intentional plans for His people.<p><b>&#8220;and to determine its width and length.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the specific dimensions of Jerusalem, highlighting the city's physical and spiritual significance. In biblical symbolism, dimensions often represent completeness and perfection, as seen in the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>, which is measured to signify its divine perfection. Historically, Jerusalem's size was a concern for returning exiles, as they sought to rebuild and repopulate the city. The act of determining its dimensions underscores God's promise of restoration and expansion, ensuring that Jerusalem would once again be a place of security and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God, encouraging the Israelites during the post-exilic period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_measuring_line.htm">The Man with the Measuring Line</a></b><br>A symbolic figure representing God's intention to restore and protect Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city central to Jewish identity and worship, symbolizing God's presence and future glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation given to Zechariah, illustrating God's plans for Jerusalem's restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Jewish people returning from Babylonian captivity, seeking hope and reassurance of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty and Plans</a></b><br>The act of measuring signifies God's control and detailed plans for His people.
