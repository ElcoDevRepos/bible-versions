The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's command over heavenly armies, reflecting His power and majesty. This introduction assures the reader that the message is not of human origin but a divine revelation.<p><b>In those days:</b><br>This phrase points to a future time, often associated with messianic expectations or eschatological events. It suggests a period of fulfillment of God's promises, possibly during the Messianic age or the end times, when God's kingdom will be fully realized on earth.<p><b>ten men from the nations of every tongue:</b><br>The number ten can symbolize completeness or a significant group in biblical numerology. "Nations of every tongue" indicates a universal scope, suggesting that people from all over the world, regardless of language or ethnicity, will seek the truth of God. This reflects the Abrahamic promise that all nations will be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>will tightly grasp the robe of a Jew:</b><br>Grasping the robe signifies a desire for guidance, blessing, or association with someone of spiritual significance. In the cultural context, touching a garment could imply seeking favor or protection. The Jew here represents the people of God, through whom divine truth and salvation are revealed. This act symbolizes the Gentiles' recognition of the Jews' unique relationship with God.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Let us go with you,</b><br>This request indicates a willingness to join and follow the Jewish people, acknowledging their role as bearers of divine truth. It reflects a shift from hostility or indifference to a desire for unity and shared faith.

This echoes the Emmanuel prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), which means "God with us," and points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence among humanity. The phrase suggests a testimony of God's faithfulness and the transformative power of His presence, drawing others to seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_man.htm">Jewish Man</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, chosen by God to be a light to the nations.

The Lord Himself guarantees this worldwide turning, showing His covenant faithfulness and missionary heart. Complete multitudes from every language will cling to God&#8217;s people, eager to share in the blessings of Messiah&#8217;s reign. Until that day fully arrives, the verse encourages believers to walk in visible fellowship with the Lord so that those around us can say with conviction, &#8220;We have heard that God is with you.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ten men.</span> The number ten is used for a large indefinite number (comp. <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of all languages</span> (<span class="accented">the languages</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the nations.</span> The diversity of languages shall not hinder the unity in the faith (comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a><span class="cmt_word">).

St. Cyril considers the idea to be that the heathen shall cling to the Jews like children holding their fathers' dress for support and guidance. In "the man that is a Jew" St. Jerome discerns the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">We will go with you.</span> The picture presented to the mind by this verse is of a Jew journeying to Jerusalem from some distant country to keep a solemn festival, and a number of Gentiles clinging round him, asking permission to accompany him on his journey, because they have learned how good the Lord has been to his countrymen. But the ideal intended is much more than this. Salvation, indeed, is of the Jews; it began to be announced at Jerusalem; it was preached by the Jewish apostles; its founder was of the seed of David. But the true Israelites are not merely those who are of the natural posterity of Abraham, but all true Christians united under Christ, the Head. To their number all who would be saved must be joined (comp. <a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7, 29</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>, etc.). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/8-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
