Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom of Israel, and its leaders often played crucial roles in guiding the nation spiritually and politically. The phrase "in their hearts" suggests a deep, sincere acknowledgment rather than a mere outward declaration. This internal dialogue reflects a shift in perspective, possibly influenced by divine intervention or a recognition of God's hand in their circumstances. It echoes the biblical theme of God working within the hearts of leaders, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>&#8216;The people of Jerusalem are my strength,</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, holds significant historical and spiritual importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. The leaders recognizing the people of Jerusalem as their strength suggests a unity and solidarity among the inhabitants and their leaders. This unity is crucial in times of conflict or threat, as seen throughout Israel's history. The phrase may also imply that the leaders draw strength from the collective faith and resilience of the people, reminiscent of how the community's faith can bolster leadership, as seen in Nehemiah's rebuilding efforts.<p><b>for the LORD of Hosts is their God.&#8217;</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. This acknowledgment by the leaders signifies a recognition of God's supreme role in their protection and success. The phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where God is depicted as a divine warrior defending His people, as in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. The leaders' declaration that the LORD is their God reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting themes of faithfulness and divine protection. This acknowledgment is prophetic, pointing to a future time of restoration and divine intervention, aligning with messianic expectations and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the embodiment of God's presence and power among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing the Jewish people.
