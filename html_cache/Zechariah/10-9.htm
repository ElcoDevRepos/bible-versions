Historically, this refers to the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, where the Israelites were scattered due to their disobedience. The imagery of sowing suggests intentionality and purpose, indicating that God has a plan even in their dispersion. This can be connected to the Abrahamic covenant where God promised to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars, suggesting that even in exile, God's promises remain active.<p><b>they will remember Me in distant lands</b><br>Despite being scattered, the Israelites are prophesied to maintain their identity and faith. This remembrance signifies a spiritual awakening or revival among the exiles. It echoes the promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-3</a>, where God assures that if His people return to Him, He will restore their fortunes. The phrase also highlights the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on their hearts.<p><b>they and their children will live and return</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the hope of restoration and return to the Promised Land. It implies not only survival but also thriving ("live") in foreign lands, suggesting God's provision and protection. The mention of "children" indicates a future generation that will partake in this return, emphasizing the continuity of God's promises across generations. This return can be seen as a type of the ultimate gathering of God's people, foreshadowing the eschatological hope found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>, where God promises to gather His people from the four corners of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, encouraging them to rebuild the temple and renew their covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were scattered among the nations due to their disobedience but are promised restoration and return.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various countries where the Israelites were dispersed during the exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/return.htm">Return</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites coming back to their homeland, symbolizing spiritual renewal and fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>The descendants of the Israelites who will also partake in the promise of return and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_dispersion_and_gathering.htm">God's Sovereignty in Dispersion and Gathering</a></b><br>God is in control of both the scattering and the gathering of His people.
