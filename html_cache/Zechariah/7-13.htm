Throughout the Old Testament, God consistently called Israel to repentance and obedience through prophets (e.g., Isaiah, Jeremiah). This calling reflects God's desire for a relationship with His people and His patience in giving them opportunities to return to Him.<p><b>and they would not listen,</b><br>The Israelites' refusal to listen is a recurring theme in their history. This disobedience led to consequences such as exile and suffering. The hardness of heart is often compared to the stubbornness seen in Pharaoh during the Exodus (Exodus 7-11). This refusal to heed God's call is a warning against spiritual deafness and rebellion.<p><b>so when they called</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a reversal of roles. The people, in times of distress, would call upon God for deliverance. This reflects a common pattern where people turn to God in desperation after ignoring Him in times of prosperity. It underscores the importance of consistent faithfulness rather than seeking God only in crisis.<p><b>I would not listen,</b><br>God's refusal to listen is a form of divine judgment. It serves as a consequence of persistent disobedience and a broken covenant relationship. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>, where wisdom warns that those who ignore her will not be heard in their time of need. It emphasizes the seriousness of rejecting God's call.<p><b>says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power. It is a reminder of His authority over all creation, including heavenly armies. This title assures that the message is not just from a local deity but from the supreme ruler of the universe. It reinforces the gravity of the warning and the certainty of its fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile.

From the Exodus onward He faithfully reached out&#8212;through Moses, through the prophets, through His covenant promises. Think of <a href="/isaiah/65-12.htm">Isaiah 65:12</a>, &#8220;I called, but you did not answer,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>, &#8220;I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s call was:<p>&#8226; Return to Me (<a href="/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Act with justice and mercy (<a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Walk humbly and love covenant faithfulness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>Every word was a real, historical summons. God does not issue empty invitations; His voice carries authority and love in perfect harmony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they would not listen</b><p>Israel&#8217;s refusal was deliberate: plugging their ears, hardening their hearts (<a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11&#8211;12</a>). <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a> says they &#8220;mocked God&#8217;s messengers,&#8221; while <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> depicts people who &#8220;refused to heed&#8221; wisdom&#8217;s plea. Rebellion is never a communication problem&#8212;it is a will problem. God&#8217;s people chose:<p>&#8226; Tradition over obedience (<a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-interest over compassion (<a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Ritual over relationship (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>).<p>Their non-listening posture set in motion an inevitable spiritual law: persistent neglect of God&#8217;s voice leads to the silence of judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so when they called</b><p>Trouble finally drove the nation to cry out. <a href="/judges/10-10.htm">Judges 10:10-14</a> offers a similar scene: Israel calls, but God reminds them of their past unfaithfulness. <a href="/psalms/18-41.htm">Psalm 18:41</a> says, &#8220;They cried for help, but there was no one to save.&#8221; It is sobering to realize that calling on God is not a magic formula; it must spring from genuine repentance (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). Crisis prayers without prior submission often reveal fear of consequences rather than love for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I would not listen</b><p>Here is the shocking but righteous consequence (compare <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>; <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>). When mercy is spurned, justice steps forward. God temporarily withholds answers to:<p>&#8226; Expose the emptiness of ceremonial religion (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Vindicate His holiness (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Drive hearts toward true repentance (<a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>).<p>Even under judgment, the Lord&#8217;s purpose is redemptive; yet the refusal to listen places people outside the immediate enjoyment of His covenant blessings. The New Testament echoes this principle: &#8220;You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-3.htm">James 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>says the LORD of Hosts</b><p>The title &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; underscores that the One speaking commands angelic armies and controls nations (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>). His verdict is final, His resources unlimited, His authority unquestionable. When the Lord of Hosts declares, &#8220;I would not listen,&#8221; no earthly power can overturn it. Yet this same sovereign Lord later sends the true Shepherd (<a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>) and opens a fountain for sin and impurity (<a href="/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>), proving that His justice and mercy operate hand in hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; God persistently calls; people must respond in humble obedience.<p>&#8226; Repeated refusal to heed His voice hardens hearts and invites judgment.<p>&#8226; Crisis-driven prayers without repentance do not override God&#8217;s righteous standards.<p>&#8226; The Lord of Hosts has both the right and the power to withhold answers, yet His ultimate goal is restoration through repentance and faith.<p><a href="/zechariah/7-13.htm">Zechariah 7:13</a> stands as a loving warning: listen while He is speaking, so that when you speak, Heaven joyfully answers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he cried.</span> As the Lord called to them by the prophets.
