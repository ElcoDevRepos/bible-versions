In biblical context, visions are often used by God to convey messages to His prophets. This question invites Zechariah to engage with the divine revelation actively, similar to how God often asks His prophets to articulate their visions, as seen with Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I see a solid gold lampstand,&#8221; I replied,</b><br>The lampstand, or menorah, is a significant symbol in Jewish worship, originally found in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>). Made of pure gold, it represents the light of God&#8217;s presence and guidance. Gold signifies purity and divinity, indicating the holy nature of the vision. The lampstand is also a type of Christ, who is the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>&#8220;with a bowl at the top</b><br>The bowl serves as a reservoir for oil, ensuring a continuous supply to the lamps. This imagery suggests the provision and sustenance of God&#8217;s Spirit, which empowers and enlightens His people. The bowl's position at the top indicates the source of divine provision, reminiscent of the Holy Spirit's role in the life of believers (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><b>and seven lamps on it,</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness and perfection in the Bible, reflecting God&#8217;s perfect work and presence. The seven lamps may represent the fullness of God&#8217;s Spirit, as seen in the sevenfold Spirit of God mentioned in <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>. This completeness is essential for the spiritual illumination and guidance of God&#8217;s people.<p><b>with seven spouts to the lamps.</b><br>The seven spouts or channels ensure that each lamp receives a steady supply of oil, symbolizing the continuous and abundant provision of the Holy Spirit. This imagery underscores the idea that God&#8217;s Spirit is sufficient and ever-present, enabling His people to shine brightly in a dark world.

Its solid gold construction speaks of purity, preciousness, and permanence (<a href="/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>).<p>- Gold also points to divine glory (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>) and the unchanging nature of God&#8217;s truth (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9-10</a>).<p>- In <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>, seven golden lampstands symbolize congregations shining in a dark world, linking this vision to God&#8217;s ongoing call for His people to be light-bearers (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a bowl at the top</b><p>- The single bowl serves as an inexhaustible reservoir of oil, removing reliance on human refilling and picturing God&#8217;s self-sufficient supply (<a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2-6</a>).<p>- Oil consistently represents the Spirit&#8217;s empowering presence (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). The bowl therefore illustrates that every work of God flows from His Spirit, not from human effort&#8212;anticipating the message of <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, &#8220; &#8216;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&#8217; says the LORD of Hosts&#8221;.<p>- The placement &#8220;at the top&#8221; highlights heavenly origin&#8212;grace poured down from above (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and seven lamps on it,</b><p>- The original menorah in Exodus had seven lamps, so the design is historically literal and theologically deliberate (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>).<p>- Seven in Scripture conveys fullness or perfection (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).

This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. <span class="cmt_word">I have looked;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint), "I have seen." <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick all of gold</span>.

In Solomon's temple there were ten candelabra (<a href="/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>), which were carried away to Babylon when Jerusalem was taken (<a href="/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>). The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. <span class="cmt_word">With a</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">howl upon the top of it.</span> The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps. In the tabernacle each lamp was separate, and trimmed and filled by the ministering priests; the mystic lamps needed no human agency to keep them supplied. They were fed by the "bowl." The word is translated in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">lampas</span>; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning "a fountain" (<a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>), or "a ball" (<a href="/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>), or "a round bowl" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof.</span> The Hebrew is, literally rendered, <span class="accented">seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus</span>. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first "seven" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span>, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, "There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first "seven," or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: "Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes." Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">see?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;I see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a solid gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lampstand,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4501.htm">Strong's 4501: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chandelier</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1441;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
