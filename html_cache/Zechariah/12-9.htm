In prophetic literature, "that day" signifies a moment when God acts decisively in history. It is a time of both judgment and salvation, often linked to eschatological events.<p><b>I will set out to destroy</b><br>The language of destruction here indicates a divine judgment against those who oppose God's purposes. This reflects the biblical theme of God as a warrior who fights on behalf of His people. The imagery is consistent with other prophetic texts where God intervenes to protect Israel, such as in <a href="/isaiah/34-2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>.<p><b>all the nations</b><br>This phrase suggests a universal scope, indicating that the opposition to Jerusalem is not limited to a few nations but involves a global coalition. This aligns with other prophetic visions where nations gather against Israel, as seen in <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>. It underscores the widespread rebellion against God's chosen city and people.<p><b>that come against Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem holds a central place in biblical prophecy as the city of God, the focal point of His covenant with Israel. Historically, Jerusalem has been the target of numerous sieges and attacks, making it a symbol of both divine promise and human conflict. Theologically, this phrase points to the ultimate vindication of Jerusalem as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the New Jerusalem descends from heaven. The city's significance is not only historical but also eschatological, representing God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel, particularly concerning the future of Jerusalem and the coming of the Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and the focal point of many biblical prophecies.
