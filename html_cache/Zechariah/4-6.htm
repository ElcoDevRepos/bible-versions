In the context of biblical prophecy, such direct messages are significant as they convey divine will and guidance. The use of an intermediary, like an angel, is common in prophetic literature, emphasizing the sacredness and authority of the message.<p><b>&#8220;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel:</b><br>Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah and a key leader in the rebuilding of the temple after the Babylonian exile. His lineage traces back to King David, making him a significant figure in the restoration of Israel. The phrase underscores the divine origin of the message, affirming that it is not merely human advice but a directive from God Himself. This highlights the importance of divine guidance in leadership and governance.<p><b>Not by might nor by power,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the futility of relying on human strength or military force to accomplish God's purposes. In the historical context, the returned exiles faced opposition and challenges in rebuilding the temple. The message serves as a reminder that success in God's work does not depend on human resources or abilities. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the name of the Lord.<p><b>but by My Spirit,</b><br>The Spirit of God is presented as the true source of power and success. This reflects a broader biblical theme where the Holy Spirit empowers individuals to fulfill God's will, as seen in the lives of figures like Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The emphasis on the Spirit underscores the necessity of divine intervention and guidance in achieving spiritual and physical restoration.<p><b>says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies. It conveys His ultimate authority and power over all creation. This assurance of divine backing would have been particularly comforting to Zerubbabel and the Israelites, reinforcing the message that their efforts are supported by the Almighty. The title is frequently used in the Old Testament to remind God's people of His omnipotence and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God to encourage the Israelites during the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerubbabel.htm">Zerubbabel</a></b><br>The governor of Judah and a descendant of David, tasked with leading the reconstruction of the temple.

Doubtless Zerubbabel was dispirited when he thought how much there was to do, how feeble the means at his disposal (<a href="/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>), and how formidable the opposition; and nothing could better reassure him than the promise of Divine aid. <span class="cmt_word">But by my Spirit.</span> The angel does not say expressly what is to be done; but the purpose that filled the minds of Zechariah and Zerubbabel applied the word.
