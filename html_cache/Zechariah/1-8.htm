Zechariah's vision occurs at night, suggesting a period of spiritual darkness for Israel. This aligns with the post-exilic context, as the Israelites were returning from Babylonian captivity and rebuilding their identity and faith.<p><b>and saw a man riding on a red horse.</b><br>The man on the red horse is often interpreted as an angelic being or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, known as a Christophany. The red horse may symbolize war or judgment, reflecting the tumultuous times Israel faced. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>, where a red horse represents war and bloodshed.<p><b>He was standing among the myrtle trees in the hollow,</b><br>Myrtle trees are evergreen and symbolize peace and recovery, often associated with the Feast of Tabernacles. The hollow, or low place, may represent humility or the valley of vision, where God reveals His plans. This setting suggests a message of hope and restoration for Israel, as myrtle trees were used in the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>).<p><b>and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.</b><br>The presence of multiple horses indicates a heavenly army or divine patrol, suggesting God's active involvement in world affairs. The colors may represent different aspects of God's judgment and mercy. Red could symbolize war, sorrel (a reddish-brown) may indicate a mixed state of peace and conflict, and white often represents victory and purity. This imagery is reminiscent of the four horsemen in <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, symbolizing various divine interventions in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (<a href="/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. <span class="cmt_word">A man riding upon a red horse.</span> This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, "that stood among the myrtle trees," serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as "behind" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11.
