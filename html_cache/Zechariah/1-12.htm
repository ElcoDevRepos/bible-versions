This figure appears throughout the Old Testament, delivering messages and guidance from God. In Zechariah, the angel serves as an intermediary between God and the prophet, highlighting the divine concern for Israel's plight.<p><b>&#8220;How long, O LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. The question "How long" reflects a common biblical theme of lament and longing for divine intervention, seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>, where the faithful cry out for God's deliverance.<p><b>will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel, had experienced destruction and exile due to the people's disobedience. The plea for mercy indicates a desire for restoration and forgiveness, aligning with God's covenant promises to His people. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of redemption and the hope for a renewed Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>.<p><b>and the cities of Judah</b><br>The cities of Judah, representing the southern kingdom, were also affected by the Babylonian exile. The mention of these cities highlights the widespread impact of God's judgment and the collective need for restoration. This ties into the prophetic promises of rebuilding and renewal found in books like <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>.<p><b>with which You have been angry</b><br>God's anger is depicted as a response to Israel's persistent sin and idolatry, leading to their exile. This divine anger is not arbitrary but rooted in justice and holiness. However, it is also tempered by His enduring love and commitment to His covenant, as seen in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a>.<p><b>these seventy years?&#8221;</b><br>The seventy years refer to the prophesied period of Babylonian captivity, as foretold by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). This timeframe signifies a complete period of judgment and purification, after which God promises restoration. The fulfillment of this prophecy underscores God's faithfulness to His word and His plans for Israel's future, as seen in <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a> and <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who often appears in the Old Testament, sometimes identified with God Himself.
