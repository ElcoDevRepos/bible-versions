The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God as the commander of heavenly armies, underscoring His power and ability to fulfill His promises. This introduction assures the audience that the following prophecy is divinely ordained and certain.<p><b>Old men and old women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem:</b><br>This imagery signifies peace, security, and longevity, contrasting with the previous desolation and turmoil experienced by Jerusalem. In ancient times, the presence of elderly people in public spaces was a sign of societal stability and blessing, as they were often the first to suffer in times of war or hardship. This promise of restoration is a reversal of the curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience led to destruction and exile. The prophecy also reflects the hope of a restored community where life can flourish.<p><b>Each with a staff in hand because of great age:</b><br>The staff symbolizes both the wisdom and the frailty that come with old age. In biblical times, a staff was a common tool for support and guidance, often associated with shepherds and leaders. The mention of "great age" highlights the blessing of a long life, which is seen as a reward for righteousness in scriptures such as <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>. This vision of elderly people living to a ripe old age in Jerusalem is a testament to God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20-22</a>, which also speak of longevity and prosperity in the restored Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
