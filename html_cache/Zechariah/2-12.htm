Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom of Israel, known for its capital, Jerusalem. The idea of God taking possession suggests a restoration of His people after the Babylonian exile. This echoes the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, where God promised to be their God and they His people (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's faithfulness to His covenant, despite Israel's unfaithfulness. This possession is not merely territorial but spiritual, indicating a renewed relationship.<p><b>in the Holy Land</b><br>The term "Holy Land" is significant as it denotes a land set apart by God for His purposes. Geographically, this refers to the region historically known as Canaan, which became the land of Israel. The holiness of the land is tied to God's presence and His acts of salvation history, such as the giving of the Law at Sinai and the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem. This phrase also anticipates the eschatological hope of a restored and sanctified land, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35:1-2</a>, where the land will rejoice and blossom.<p><b>and He will once again choose Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase highlights Jerusalem's central role in God's redemptive plan. Historically, Jerusalem was the political and spiritual center of Israel, housing the Temple, the symbol of God's presence among His people. The phrase "once again choose" suggests a reaffirmation of Jerusalem's significance after periods of judgment and exile. This choice is prophetic, pointing to future events where Jerusalem will be the focal point of God's kingdom, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>. It also typologically points to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the Temple and the presence of God among His people (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is actively involved in the restoration and future of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>A significant tribe of Israel, representing the southern kingdom, which holds a special place in God's redemptive plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_land.htm">The Holy Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, which is set apart by God for His purposes and His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God as the center of worship and the future site of His divine presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of hope and restoration to the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God remains faithful to His covenant with Israel, demonstrating His unchanging nature and commitment to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_jerusalem.htm">The Significance of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Jerusalem holds a central place in God's redemptive plan, symbolizing His presence and future hope for all believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_land_as_a_symbol_of_god's_kingdom.htm">The Holy Land as a Symbol of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>The land of Israel serves as a tangible reminder of God's kingdom purposes and His desire to dwell among His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope_for_the_future.htm">Restoration and Hope for the Future</a></b><br>God's promise to choose Jerusalem again offers hope for restoration, not only for Israel but for all who trust in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/our_role_in_god's_redemptive_plan.htm">Our Role in God's Redemptive Plan</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to participate in God's ongoing work of restoration and to live as witnesses of His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Zechariah_2_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Zechariah 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_2_12_God_s_chosen_Jerusalem.htm">How does Zechariah 2:12 emphasize God's choice of Jerusalem as His inheritance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Holy_Land_today.htm">What does "the Holy Land" signify in Zechariah 2:12 for believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_2_12_Genesis_covenant_link.htm">How does Zechariah 2:12 connect with God's covenant promises in Genesis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Zech_2_12_daily.htm">How can we apply God's faithfulness in Zechariah 2:12 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jerusalem_s_role_in_God_s_plan_in_Zech_2_12.htm">What role does Jerusalem play in God's redemptive plan according to Zechariah 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_2_12_on_God_Judah_Israel.htm">What does Zechariah 2:12 reveal about God's relationship with Judah and Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_2_12_God_s_promise_meaning.htm">How does Zechariah 2:12 reflect God's promise to His chosen people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_Holy_Land_important_in_Zech_2_12.htm">What is the significance of the "Holy Land" in Zechariah 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_zechariah_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Zechariah 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_records_show_god_took_judah.htm">Zechariah 2:12 &#8211;

Zechariah reassures the post-exilic community that God has not abandoned His covenant. Just as <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a> says, &#8220;For the LORD&#8217;s portion is His people, Jacob His allotted inheritance,&#8221; the prophet echoes that promise to Judah specifically.<p>&#8226; Taking &#8220;possession&#8221; points to renewed ownership after judgment and exile. The same idea shines through in <a href="/jeremiah/31-1.htm">Jeremiah 31:1</a>, &#8220;At that time&#8230; I will be the God of all the families of Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is no mere metaphor; the Lord literally re-establishes His claim. His covenant love&#8212;unchanged by centuries of rebellion&#8212;now moves Him to restore Judah, much as <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a> speaks of a coming day when they will be &#8220;My treasured possession.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The promise reminds every generation that God&#8217;s discipline never nullifies His election. <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a> affirms, &#8220;For God&#8217;s gifts and His call are irrevocable.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Holy Land</b><p>&#8226; Zechariah is the only Old Testament book that uses &#8220;Holy Land&#8221;, underlining how the land itself is set apart by God&#8217;s presence and purpose. <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> reminds us, &#8220;The land is Mine.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Calling the territory &#8220;holy&#8221; ties back to <a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>, where God tells Moses, &#8220;The place where you are standing is holy ground.&#8221; Wherever God dwells becomes sacred by definition.<p>&#8226; By restoring Judah in the land, the Lord is not merely giving real estate; He is re-establishing a stage for His redemptive plan. <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a> all anticipate that the land will host future glory and worship.<p>&#8226; The phrase also signals an eschatological horizon. Zechariah&#8217;s later visions (<a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9-11</a>) depict a cleansed, secure land where the Lord reigns visibly&#8212;a foretaste of the kingdom Christ will establish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He will once again choose Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Once again&#8221; signals renewal of a previous choice. <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a> affirms, &#8220;For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home.&#8221; After exile, God repeats that election.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a> already promised, &#8220;My house will be rebuilt in it&#8230; and the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.&#8221; Chapter 2 now underscores that vow.<p>&#8226; Choosing Jerusalem carries both immediate and future layers:<p>&#8211; Immediate: rebuilding the temple (<a href="/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14-18</a>) and city walls (<a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15-16</a>) so worship can resume.<p>&#8211; Future: the city becomes the earthly capital for Messiah&#8217;s reign (<a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s renewed choice neutralizes every human objection. Nations that once opposed Jerusalem (e.g., Babylon) are rendered powerless because the city&#8217;s security rests on divine decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a> anchors hope in God&#8217;s unchanging commitment: He personally reclaims Judah, sanctifies the land, and re-elects Jerusalem.

Every land is holy where the Lord dwells. The conversion of the heathen should emanate from Judaea (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>), and spread through all the world, and thus the earth should be holy ground. Shall choose Jerusalem again; Revised Version, "shall yet choose Jerusalem" (comp. <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>).
