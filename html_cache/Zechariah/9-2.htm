It was known for its strategic location and influence in the region. In biblical history, Hamath is frequently mentioned as a boundary marker for the northern extent of Israel's territory (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). The mention of Hamath in this prophecy indicates a divine judgment extending beyond Israel's immediate neighbors, suggesting a broader scope of God's sovereignty and justice. This reflects the theme of God's dominion over all nations, not just Israel.<p><b>as well as Tyre and Sidon</b><br>Tyre and Sidon were prominent Phoenician cities located along the Mediterranean coast, known for their wealth, trade, and maritime prowess. These cities were often seen as symbols of human pride and economic power. In the Old Testament, Tyre is frequently mentioned in prophecies of judgment due to its arrogance and opposition to God's people (Ezekiel 26-28). Sidon, similarly, is noted for its idolatry and moral corruption (Isaiah 23). The inclusion of Tyre and Sidon in this prophecy underscores the theme of divine retribution against nations that exalt themselves against God, highlighting the futility of relying on human wisdom and riches.<p><b>though they are very shrewd</b><br>The shrewdness of Tyre and Sidon refers to their reputation for wisdom, particularly in commerce and diplomacy. These cities were renowned for their ability to navigate complex political landscapes and maintain economic dominance. However, the prophetic message here is that human wisdom and cunning are ultimately insufficient to withstand divine judgment. This echoes the biblical principle that true wisdom comes from God and that human understanding is limited (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a>). The judgment against these cities serves as a reminder that reliance on worldly wisdom and power is futile in the face of God's sovereign plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamath.htm">Hamath</a></b><br>An ancient city located in modern-day Syria, known for its strategic importance and historical significance.

The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>l; <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; and comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). The judgment was inflicted by Alexander the Great after the battle of Issus, <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, when Damascus was betrayed into his hands and plundered of all its enormous treasures. <span class="cmt_word">Tyrus and Zidon.</span> Tyre was taken after a siege of seven months, its walls were demolished, its houses burnt, ten thousand of its defenders were massacred, the women and children sold as slaves; and it never rose to greatness again. Zidon, originally the chief city of the country, had long been eclipsed by its daughter, Tyre: it submitted to Alexander without a struggle. <span class="cmt_word">Though it be very wise;</span> or, <span class="accented">because she is very wise.</span> The pronoun refers to Tyre, the mention of Zidon being, as it were, parenthetical. In spite of, or because of, its boasted wisdom, Tyre should suffer heavy punishment. The wisdom of Tyre is spoken of in <a href="/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3, 4</a>. Wright, as the LXX., makes the clause refer to both cities, "though they be very wise."
