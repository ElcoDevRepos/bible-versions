In the context of biblical prophecy, questions often signify a search for divine wisdom and insight. Zechariah's inquiry is reminiscent of other prophetic dialogues, such as those found in Daniel and Revelation, where the seer seeks clarity on the visions presented. This approach underscores the importance of seeking God's interpretation rather than relying on human understanding.<p><b>And he replied, &#8220;A measuring basket is going forth.&#8221;</b><br>The "measuring basket" (often referred to as an ephah) is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, symbolizing commerce and trade. Its appearance in the vision suggests a focus on economic practices and possibly the corruption associated with them. The act of "going forth" implies movement or action, indicating that the vision pertains to an active judgment or process. This imagery connects to other biblical passages where measures and weights are used to symbolize justice and righteousness, such as in <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, where dishonest scales are condemned.<p><b>Then he continued, &#8220;This is their iniquity in all the land.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase identifies the contents of the basket as representing the iniquity or sin of the people. The use of "all the land" suggests a widespread moral and spiritual corruption affecting the entire nation. This aligns with the broader themes of Zechariah, where the prophet calls for repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness. The vision serves as a warning of divine judgment against pervasive sin, echoing the messages of earlier prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The concept of iniquity being measured and judged is also seen in Revelation, where the sins of Babylon are weighed and punished.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period who received visions from God to encourage the Israelites in rebuilding the temple and renewing their covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel.htm">Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who interprets the visions for Zechariah, providing clarity and understanding of God's messages.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/measuring_basket.htm">Measuring Basket (Ephah)</a></b><br>A large container used for measuring grain, symbolizing the iniquity and wickedness of the people in the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, representing the people and their collective moral and spiritual state.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The sin and moral corruption prevalent among the people, which God is addressing through this vision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_measuring_basket.htm">Symbolism of the Measuring Basket</a></b><br>The ephah represents the full measure of sin and iniquity.

The ephah was the largest of the dry measures in use among the Jews, and was equal to six or seven gallons. It was, of course, too small to contain a woman. The LXX. calls it simply "the measure;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">amphora</span>; and it must be considered as an imaginary vessel of huge size. It may have a tacit reference to dishonest dealings (comp. <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This is their resemblance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this is their eye</span>. The Authorized Version explains the meaning accurately. "Eye" is often used for that which is seen, as in <a href="/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>, where the Authorized Version has "colour;" and <a href="/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where in reference to the manna we read, "The eve thereof was as the eye of bdellium" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 16</a>). So here the meaning is: This ephah and this whole vision represent the wicked in the land. Some take "the eye" to mean the object of sight, that to which they look. But the ephah was not sot forth for all the people to examine. The LXX. and Syriac, from some variation in the reading, have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "iniquity," and some critics have desired to adopt this in the text.
