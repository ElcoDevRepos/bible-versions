This phrase indicates divine communication, emphasizing the importance of the message. Angels are often seen as God's servants who deliver His will to humans, as seen in other biblical accounts such as <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a> and <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>.<p><b>These are the four spirits of heaven</b><br>The "four spirits" can be understood as divine agents or forces sent by God to execute His will on earth. The number four often symbolizes universality or completeness in the Bible, as seen in the four corners of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). These spirits may also be connected to the four horsemen in <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, representing God's sovereign control over world events.<p><b>going forth from their station</b><br>This phrase suggests a mission or purpose, indicating that these spirits are actively involved in carrying out God's plans. The idea of "station" implies a place of readiness and authority, similar to the heavenly council depicted in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>, where divine beings present themselves before God.<p><b>before the Lord of all the earth</b><br>This title for God emphasizes His sovereignty and dominion over the entire world. It reflects the monotheistic belief that God is not just a local deity but the ruler of all creation, as affirmed in passages like <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>. This phrase also underscores the accountability of all spiritual beings to God, reinforcing His ultimate authority and control over both heavenly and earthly realms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period who received visions from God, including the vision of the four chariots in <a href="/bsb/zechariah/6.htm">Zechariah 6</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who interprets the visions for Zechariah, providing insight into God's plans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_spirits_of_heaven.htm">The Four Spirits of Heaven</a></b><br>Represented by the four chariots, these are divine agents sent by God to execute His will on earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_all_the_earth.htm">The Lord of All the Earth</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and authority over the entire world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_station.htm">The Station</a></b><br>The starting point or position from which the four spirits are dispatched, indicating readiness and divine order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The vision of the four spirits emphasizes God's ultimate control over the earth.

It was a familiar symbol to the Jews. The winds are often introduced in executing God's will on sinners (comp. <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth from standing before the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>). The winds are supposed to be God's servants, waiting his pleasure to be sent forth on his errands. The Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "which go forth to stand before the Lord." This denotes merely their usual obedience; but the text implies that the prophet sees them moving from their usual expectant attitude, and hastening forth to do God's commands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
