This reflects the sovereignty of God over the affairs of nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14-16</a>, where God gathers nations for judgment. Historically, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict, and this prophecy points to a future eschatological battle. The gathering of nations against Jerusalem is reminiscent of past sieges, such as those by Babylon and Rome, but this prophecy suggests a more comprehensive, global coalition.<p><b>and the city will be captured</b><br>The capture of Jerusalem has occurred multiple times in history, notably by the Babylonians in 586 BC and the Romans in AD 70. This phrase suggests a future event where Jerusalem will again fall into enemy hands. Theologically, it underscores the theme of judgment and redemption, as Jerusalem's capture often precedes divine intervention and restoration.<p><b>the houses looted</b><br>Looting is a common consequence of ancient warfare, reflecting the totality of the city's defeat. This phrase highlights the severity of the invasion and the suffering of the inhabitants. It echoes the lamentations of prophets like Jeremiah, who witnessed the destruction and plundering of Jerusalem (<a href="/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2</a>).<p><b>and the women ravished</b><br>This tragic consequence of war underscores the brutality and inhumanity often associated with military conquests. It serves as a stark reminder of the moral decay and lawlessness that accompany such events. The violation of women in times of war is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, as seen in passages like <a href="/judges/19-25.htm">Judges 19:25-26</a>, and it emphasizes the need for divine justice and restoration.<p><b>Half of the city will go into exile</b><br>Exile is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing both judgment and purification. The division of the city into those exiled and those remaining suggests a partial judgment, reminiscent of the Babylonian exile where a remnant was left in the land (<a href="/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>). This division may also symbolize a separation between the faithful and unfaithful, as seen in the parable of the sheep and goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city</b><br>This phrase indicates that a remnant will remain in Jerusalem, a common biblical motif where God preserves a faithful group through trials (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). This remnant theme is crucial in understanding God's covenant faithfulness and His plans for restoration. It suggests hope and continuity, pointing to future redemption and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city in biblical prophecy, often representing God's chosen people and His divine plan. In this verse, it is the focal point of a future conflict involving all nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_the_nations.htm">All the Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the collective forces of the world that will come against Jerusalem. This gathering signifies a global opposition to God's purposes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_captured.htm">The City Captured</a></b><br>This event indicates a temporary victory for the opposing forces, symbolizing a time of great trial and tribulation for God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile_and_remnant.htm">Exile and Remnant</a></b><br>Half of the city's population will go into exile, while the rest remain. This division highlights the theme of judgment and preservation found throughout Scripture.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_gathering.htm">Divine Gathering</a></b><br>The phrase "I will gather" indicates God's sovereign control over the events, emphasizing His ultimate authority and purpose even in times of chaos.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>Even in times of great distress, God remains in control.

We must remain vigilant and equipped with the armor of God to withstand such trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_amidst_tribulation.htm">Hope Amidst Tribulation</a></b><br>The preservation of a remnant in Jerusalem serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness.
