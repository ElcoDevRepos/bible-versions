The "earlier prophets" likely refer to figures such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, who consistently called Israel to repentance and warned of judgment. This continuity underscores the unchanging nature of God's expectations and the importance of heeding prophetic warnings. The prophets often spoke against social injustice, idolatry, and empty religious rituals, urging a return to genuine worship and obedience.<p><b>when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were populous and prosperous</b><br>This part of the verse recalls a time of economic and social flourishing in Jerusalem and its neighboring areas. Historically, this could refer to the period before the Babylonian exile, when the kingdom of Judah was thriving. The prosperity mentioned here serves as a backdrop to highlight the people's complacency and neglect of God's commands during times of abundance. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as prosperity without righteousness leads to downfall.<p><b>and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in the southern part of Israel, while the foothills refer to the Shephelah, a region of low hills between the coastal plain and the central highlands. These areas being "inhabited" suggests a time of security and stability, as these regions were often vulnerable to external threats. The mention of these areas indicates the extent of the land's prosperity and the comprehensive nature of the population's well-being. It also serves as a geographical reminder of the full scope of God's blessings when the people were obedient, contrasting with the desolation that followed their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, representing God's authority and the source of the prophetic message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earlier_prophets.htm">Earlier Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the prophets who spoke God's words to Israel before the Babylonian exile, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant in Jewish history and the center of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_negev.htm">The Negev</a></b><br>A desert region in southern Israel, symbolizing the extent of the land's prosperity and habitation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foothills.htm">The Foothills (Shephelah)</a></b><br>A region of lowlands in Israel, indicating the breadth of the land's peace and prosperity during the time referenced.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_heeding_god's_word.htm">The Importance of Heeding God's Word</a></b><br>The passage reminds us that God's words through the prophets are timeless and should be heeded.
