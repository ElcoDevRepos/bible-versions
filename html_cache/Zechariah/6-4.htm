This reflects the belief in a structured heavenly hierarchy and the role of angels as messengers of God. The angelic presence signifies the importance of the vision and its divine origin. In the context of Zechariah, angels frequently appear to provide guidance and interpretation, as seen in other visions throughout the book (e.g., <a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9, 1</a>:19). This interaction underscores the prophet's role as a mediator between God and His people, seeking understanding of divine revelations.<p><b>&#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221;</b><br>Zechariah's question indicates his desire for clarity and understanding of the vision he is witnessing. The term "my lord" is a respectful address, acknowledging the angel's authority and the gravity of the message. This inquiry reflects a common theme in prophetic literature where the prophet seeks to comprehend the often enigmatic and symbolic visions presented to them. The question also highlights the human need for divine interpretation, as seen in other biblical instances such as Daniel's visions (<a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>) and John's visions in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13-14</a>).

Scripture often commends those who seek clarification from God&#8217;s messengers (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Zechariah modeled the same humble curiosity when he asked, &#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221; during the vision of the myrtle trees (<a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel followed a similar pattern, requesting insight about his own visions (<a href="/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>).<p>The verse reminds believers that God welcomes sincere questions as we pursue His revealed truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the angel</b><p>An angel has accompanied Zechariah through each night vision (<a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>; 2:3).<p>&#8226; Angels serve as &#8220;ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; They communicate divine messages, as seen with Gabriel to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26&#8211;38</a>) and to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence underscores the supernatural origin and reliability of the revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was speaking with me</b><p>The continuing dialogue shows an ongoing relationship, not a one-time encounter.<p>&#8226; Similar phrases appear in <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8&#8211;9</a>, highlighting personal interaction between heaven&#8217;s messengers and God&#8217;s servants.<p>&#8226;

The prophet&#8217;s specific query sets up the angel&#8217;s detailed answer in verses 5&#8211;8, identifying the chariots as &#8220;the four spirits of heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar interpretive exchanges occur when Ezekiel asks about the dry bones (<a href="/ezekiel/37-3.htm">Ezekiel 37:3</a>) and when John wonders at the meaning of the seven stars (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226;

The verse assures us that the Lord provides understanding through His appointed messengers, confirming that His revelations&#8212;though sometimes symbolic&#8212;are meant to be grasped and obeyed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I inquired</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who was speaking with me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are these,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my lord?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_113.htm">Strong's 113: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sovereign, controller</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/zechariah/6-4.htm">OT Prophets: Zechariah 6:4 Then I asked the angel who talked (Zech.
