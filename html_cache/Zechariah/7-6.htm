Historically, fasting was a significant religious observance, often associated with mourning or seeking God's favor. However, the context here suggests that the people were engaging in these activities without genuine spiritual intent. The reference to eating and drinking highlights the contrast between outward religious rituals and the inward spiritual reality. In biblical times, feasting was a communal activity, often associated with celebrations and religious festivals, such as Passover or the Feast of Tabernacles. The prophet Zechariah challenges the people to consider the true purpose of their actions, echoing the sentiments found in <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-7</a>, where God criticizes empty rituals.<p><b>were you not doing so simply for yourselves?</b><br>This phrase questions the motivation behind the people's actions, suggesting that their fasting and feasting were self-centered rather than God-centered. The critique is that their religious practices had become mere formalities, lacking genuine devotion or concern for God's will. This self-serving attitude is reminiscent of the rebukes found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>, where God expresses disdain for insincere worship. The emphasis on self-interest contrasts with the biblical call to love God and neighbor, as seen in the Great Commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). The challenge is to examine one's heart and ensure that religious observance is not merely a ritual but a true expression of faith and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.
