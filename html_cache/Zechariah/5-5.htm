This particular angel is a divine guide, providing clarity and understanding to the prophet. The presence of angels in Zechariah's visions underscores the heavenly origin of the messages and the importance of divine revelation. Angels are frequently depicted as God's messengers throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> with Lot and in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> with Mary. The angel's role here is to ensure that Zechariah comprehends the vision, which is crucial for conveying God's message to the people.<p><b>&#8220;Now lift up your eyes and see</b><br>The command to "lift up your eyes" is a call to attention and awareness, urging Zechariah to focus on the vision being presented. This phrase is often used in Scripture to signify the need for spiritual insight and understanding beyond the physical realm. For example, in <a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14</a>, God tells Abram to lift up his eyes to see the land promised to him. It is an invitation to perceive divine realities and truths that are not immediately apparent. This call to see is not just physical but spiritual, encouraging the prophet to discern the deeper meaning of the vision.<p><b>what is approaching.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "what is approaching" indicates an impending event or revelation. In the context of Zechariah's visions, it often signifies a future occurrence or judgment. This particular vision involves a flying scroll, symbolizing God's judgment against sin, specifically theft and falsehood, as detailed in the subsequent verses. The notion of something approaching can also be seen in prophetic literature as a forewarning of God's intervention, as in the coming of the Day of the Lord described in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>. It serves as a reminder of the certainty of God's plans and the need for readiness and repentance among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah is the recipient of visions and messages from God, intended to encourage and guide the Israelites as they rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's visions and messages to Zechariah.
