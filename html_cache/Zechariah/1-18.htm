In biblical literature, looking up often signifies receiving insight or understanding from God. This is a common motif in prophetic literature, where the prophet is shown visions that reveal God's plans or messages. It emphasizes the role of the prophet as a seer who perceives divine truths.<p><b>and saw four horns.</b><br>Horns in biblical symbolism often represent power, strength, and authority, particularly in the context of nations or kingdoms. The number four is significant, often symbolizing completeness or universality, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four winds. In this context, the four horns likely represent the oppressive powers or nations that have scattered and oppressed Israel. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic books, such as Daniel, where horns symbolize kings or kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>).
