It was one of the places where Abraham and Jacob worshiped God (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 28</a>:19). By the time of Zechariah, Bethel had become a center of idolatry during the divided kingdom period (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-33</a>). The mention of Bethel here indicates a return to seeking the true God, reflecting a shift from idolatry back to worshiping Yahweh.<p><b>had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech</b><br>Sharezer and Regem-melech are likely officials or representatives of Bethel. Their names suggest a Babylonian influence, as "Sharezer" is of Assyrian origin, meaning "protect the king," and "Regem-melech" means "friend of the king." This reflects the historical context of the Jewish return from Babylonian exile, where many Jews had adopted Babylonian names and customs.<p><b>along with their men</b><br>The inclusion of "their men" indicates that this was a formal delegation, suggesting the importance of their mission. It underscores the communal aspect of their inquiry, representing the concerns of the people of Bethel as a whole. This collective approach highlights the seriousness with which they approached the matter at hand.<p><b>to plead before the LORD</b><br>"Plead before the LORD" implies seeking divine guidance or favor. This phrase indicates a return to the covenant relationship with God, where the people sought His will and direction. It reflects the post-exilic community's desire to align with God's purposes, reminiscent of other biblical instances where leaders sought God's counsel (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>).

But the temple is never called <span class="accented">Beth-el</span>, while a mission to the town Bethel would be unmeaning. So "Bethel" is to be taken as the subject of the sentence, thus: "Now Bethel (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they of Bethel) sent." The persons named may be taken either as the deputation or as the persons meant by "they of Bethel." The former seems most likely to be intended. The Bethelites sent these men to Jerusalem to make the inquiry. The exiles returned each to his own city, as we read in Ezra it.; among them were many people of Bethel (<a href="/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>), which town they rebuilt (<a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>).
