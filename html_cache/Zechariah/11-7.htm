The "flock marked for slaughter" represents the people of Israel, who were facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and rejection of God. This imagery is consistent with the shepherd motif found throughout Scripture, where God is often depicted as a shepherd caring for His people (Psalm 23, <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>). The idea of being "marked for slaughter" suggests a predetermined judgment, reflecting the consequences of Israel's covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>especially the afflicted of the flock</b><br>This highlights God's concern for the marginalized and oppressed within Israel. The "afflicted" refers to those who are suffering or disadvantaged, emphasizing God's compassion and justice. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's preferential care for the poor and needy (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). It also foreshadows the ministry of Jesus, who often reached out to the marginalized and afflicted (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><b>Then I took for myself two staffs</b><br>The two staffs symbolize different aspects of God's leadership and care for His people. In ancient Near Eastern culture, shepherds used staffs for guidance and protection of their flocks. The use of two staffs here suggests a dual role or function in Zechariah's symbolic act, reflecting God's comprehensive care and governance.<p><b>calling one Favor and the other Union</b><br>The staff named "Favor" represents God's grace and blessing towards His people, while "Union" symbolizes the unity and harmony God desires among them. This dual symbolism underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where divine favor is contingent upon the people's unity and faithfulness. The breaking of these staffs later in the chapter signifies the withdrawal of God's favor and the disintegration of unity, foreshadowing the division and exile of Israel.<p><b>and I pastured the flock</b><br>This reiterates the role of the shepherd, emphasizing ongoing care and leadership. It reflects God's continued involvement with His people despite their waywardness. The act of pasturing signifies provision, guidance, and protection, echoing the pastoral imagery found in passages like <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd. This connection highlights the messianic undertones of Zechariah's actions, pointing to Christ's ultimate fulfillment of the shepherd role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites.

Here the staffs symbolize distinct aspects of God&#8217;s relationship with His people (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Taking the staffs Himself shows personal commitment; God doesn&#8217;t outsource His care (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Calling one Favor</b><p>&#8211; Favor (or &#8220;Grace&#8221;) pictures God&#8217;s covenant blessing, protection, and provision (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>).<p>&#8211; Under this staff Israel enjoyed divine shelter&#8212;manna, victories, prophets, and ultimately Messiah&#8217;s presence (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>Bullet points<p>&#8226; Favor reveals God&#8217;s kindness that the flock could never earn (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting Favor means forfeiting supernatural covering (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the other Union</b><p>&#8211; Union (&#8220;Bonds&#8221;) speaks of national and spiritual unity&#8212;Judah and Israel held together under God (<a href="/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19-22</a>).<p>&#8211; The staff kept the flock from fragmenting; likewise, God&#8217;s word and worship held the tribes together (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>Bullet points<p>&#8226; Where God&#8217;s presence is honored, unity flourishes (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; When leaders despise His shepherding, divisions erupt (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I pastured the flock</b><p>&#8211; Even with judgment looming, God actively feeds, leads, and guards His people (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse frames a probation period: opportunity to receive Grace and remain united before the staffs are broken later in the chapter (<a href="/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10, 14</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus fulfilled this by gathering disciples, healing, teaching, and offering peace; yet national rejection brought eventual ruin (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a> pictures the Lord stepping in as Shepherd to a doomed flock.

By pasturing the flock, God grants a final season of nurture and warning before those privileges are withdrawn. The verse points ahead to Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry, revealing the same heart that offers mercy to the humble while honoring human freedom to accept or refuse His shepherding.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will feed.</span> Thus the Greek and Latin Versions; but it should be, <span class="accented">So I fed</span>. It is the account of what the prophet did in accordance with the command in ver. 4 (see the end of this verse, "and I fed"). <span class="cmt_word">Even you, O poor of the flock.</span> There is difficulty about the word rendered "you" (<span class="accented">lachen</span>) which may be the personal pronoun, or an adverb meaning "therefore," "therewith," "truly," or a preposition, "on account of;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter hoc.</span> The best rendering is, <span class="accented">I fed the flock therefore the poor among the flock.</span> "Therefore" refers to the previous command. It is also rendered "in sooth." The LXX., arranging the letters differently, translates, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> "I will go and tend the flock of slaughter in the land of Canaan;" some render the last words, "for the merchants." This Jerome interprets to mean that the Lord will nourish the Israelites for slaughter in the land of the Gentiles (but see note on ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And I took unto me two staves.</span> Executing in vision his commission of feeding the flock, the prophet, as the representative of the Shepherd, took two shepherd's staves. The two staves intimate the manifold care of God for his flock from the earliest days, and the two blessings which he designed to bestow (as the names of the staves show), favour and unity. <span class="cmt_word">Beauty</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Decorem</span> (Vulgate); "Graciousness" (Revised Version margin). It probably means the favour and grace of God, as in <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Those that bind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "Cord;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Funiculum.</span> The name is meant to express the union of all the members of the flock, especially that between Israel and Judah (see ver. 14). These make one flock under one shepherd. <span class="cmt_word">I fed the flock.</span> This repetition emphasizes the beginning of the verse, and expresses God's ears in time past and in time to come also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I pastured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;er&#183;&#8216;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
