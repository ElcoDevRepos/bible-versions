It is a reminder of His sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises. This title is frequently used in the prophetic books, underscoring God's control over the unfolding of history and His protection of His people.<p><b>If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions:</b><br>This conditional statement highlights the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commandments. Walking in God's ways implies a lifestyle of righteousness and devotion. The call to keep God's instructions echoes the covenantal relationship established with Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). It reflects the broader biblical theme of covenant faithfulness.<p><b>Then you will govern My house:</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, the center of worship and God's presence among His people. Governing the house implies a role of spiritual leadership and responsibility. This promise to Joshua, the high priest, signifies a restoration of priestly authority and the proper functioning of temple worship, which had been disrupted during the Babylonian exile.<p><b>And will also have charge of My courts:</b><br>The courts of the temple were areas where various activities related to worship and justice took place. Having charge of the courts suggests a role in maintaining order and purity in worship practices. It also implies a judicial function, ensuring that God's laws are upheld within the community.<p><b>And I will give you a place among these who are standing here:</b><br>This phrase suggests a position of honor and authority among the heavenly beings or angels present in the vision. It indicates divine approval and acceptance. The imagery of standing among heavenly beings can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest and intercessor, standing in the presence of God on our behalf (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). This promise also points to the eschatological hope of believers being granted a place in God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly armies.

Because the command comes from Him, the words that follow carry absolute authority, certainty, and covenant faithfulness. In Zechariah&#8217;s vision, Joshua the high priest stands in filthy garments (<a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3</a>), yet God&#8217;s voice breaks in&#8212;proof that our hope rests not on our merit but on His sovereign declaration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you walk in My ways</b><p>&#8220;Walking&#8221; pictures a continual lifestyle, not a one&#8211;time step. The Lord calls Joshua&#8212;and, by extension, all who serve Him&#8212;to an everyday pattern of:<p>&#8226; Moral purity (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>)<p>&#8226; Justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>)<p>&#8226; Spirit&#8211;led living (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>)<p>The promise is conditional: blessing flows when the priest aligns his daily conduct with God&#8217;s path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And keep My instructions</b><p>Obedience moves beyond attitude to concrete action. God&#8217;s &#8220;instructions&#8221; cover every priestly duty (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8&#8211;10</a>) and personal devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). For Joshua, this meant guarding the restored temple&#8217;s holiness after the exile; for us, it means honoring Christ&#8217;s lordship in doctrine, worship, and lifestyle (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will govern My house</b><p>Faithful walk and obedience lead to expanded stewardship. &#8220;My house&#8221; in Zechariah&#8217;s day is the rebuilt temple (<a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>). God promises Joshua authority to oversee sacrifices and teach the people (<a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>). For believers today, the church is the &#8220;household of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). The principle stands: faithful servants are entrusted with leadership in God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And will also have charge of My courts</b><p>The &#8220;courts&#8221; broaden the sphere&#8212;everything connected with worship.

In New-Covenant terms, this foreshadows our calling to care for the gathered people of God, His living temple (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will give you a place among these who are standing here</b><p>The scene includes angelic beings standing before the LORD (<a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 7</a>). God promises Joshua secure access among them&#8212;a share in the heavenly court (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22&#8211;24</a>). Ultimately, this points to the high priestly ministry of Christ and to believers who are seated with Him &#8220;in the heavenly realms&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4&#8211;5</a>). Fellowship with God&#8217;s holy attendants becomes the reward of purified, obedient service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/3-7.htm">Zechariah 3:7</a> lays out a simple yet profound sequence: covenant relationship, obedient walk, expanded responsibility, and heavenly fellowship.

Obedience never earns salvation, but it does position us to experience the fullness of the privileges God delights to give His cleansed and committed servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Walk in my ways.</span> God's ways are his commandments, as the next words explain (comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Keep my charge.</span> The Vulgate retains the Hebraism, <span class="accented">Custodiam meam custodieris</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-14.htm">Malachi 3:14</a>). The charge means the laws and ordinances of the Mosaic institution. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. The apodosis rightly begins here, though Kimchi and others make it commence at "I will give thee," taking the following two clauses as denoting parts of his duties, the observance of which conditioned his acceptance. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also judge my house.</span> The mention of "my courts" in the following clause requires that "house" here should mean, not people or family, but, in a more restricted sense, the temple, looked upon as the spiritual centre of the nation. If the high priest kept the ordinances and commandments, he should rule and order Divine worship, and "judge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> govern, the ministers of the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Keep my courts.</span> He was to preserve the temple, and that which the temple represented, from all idolatry and ungodliness. This duty, as Hengstenberg observes, is introduced as a reward, because it was an honour and a privilege to be entrusted with such an office, and the greatest favour which God could confer upon man. <span class="cmt_word">Places to walk.</span> The LXX. takes the word as a participle, translating, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "persons walking;" so the Syriac; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ambulantes.</span> This is explained to mean that God will give him out of the band of angels (ver. 4), some to accompany and aid him in his ministrationS. But the word is best taken as a noun meaning "walks," "goings." The Revised Version gives, "a place of access" in the text, restoring the Authorized Version in the margin; but there seems to be no good reason for the Revised rendering. The translation, "goings," "walks," gives much the same signification, and is consonant with the use of the word elsewhere (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9, 4</a>). It means that Joshua should have free access to God. The gloss of the Targum, that it is here intimated that the high priest should be admitted to the company of the angels after the resurrection, is unsuitable, as the other parts of the promise have respect to this present world. <span class="cmt_word">Among these that stand by;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among the attendant angels who wait upon God to do his will, and a company of whom were gathered round the Angel of Jehovah in the vision (see ver. 4). It is natural piety to believe that the hosts of heaven join in the worship of the Church on earth, and assist godly ministers with their presence and fellowship. Here is adumbrated that access to God which the Christian enjoys in Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>). This is more fully revealed in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you walk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#234;&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in My ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7695;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
