In biblical literature, questions often serve to invite divine revelation or clarification. Zechariah's inquiry reflects a common theme in prophetic literature where the prophet seeks insight into God's plans. This mirrors other instances in scripture where prophets, like Daniel, seek understanding of visions (<a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>).<p><b>And He replied,</b><br>The response comes from an angelic figure or the Lord Himself, who provides the interpretation of the vision. This divine communication underscores the role of angels as messengers and interpreters of God's will, as seen throughout the Bible, such as in the book of Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>&#8220;These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head;</b><br>Horns in biblical symbolism often represent power or kingdoms. Here, they symbolize the oppressive nations that have scattered the people of Judah, leading to their humiliation and subjugation. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian exile and the subsequent domination by other empires. The imagery of not being able to "raise his head" conveys a state of defeat and despair, similar to the lamentations over Jerusalem's fall (<a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1-3</a>).<p><b>but the craftsmen have come to terrify them</b><br>The craftsmen, or artisans, symbolize agents of divine retribution and restoration. They are tasked with dismantling the power of the oppressive horns. This imagery suggests a reversal of fortunes, where those who were once oppressed will see their oppressors brought low. The term "craftsmen" may also imply skill and precision in God's plan to restore His people, akin to the rebuilding efforts seen in Nehemiah's time.<p><b>and throw down these horns of the nations</b><br>This phrase indicates the ultimate defeat and overthrow of the oppressive powers. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to bring down the proud and powerful, as seen in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/75-10.htm">Psalm 75:10</a>) and the prophetic declarations against Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>).<p><b>that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.&#8221;</b><br>The nations' aggression against Judah is depicted as an act of pride and defiance against God's chosen people. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of Israel's enemies being used as instruments of judgment, yet ultimately facing judgment themselves. The scattering of Judah is a direct consequence of their disobedience, yet God's promise of restoration remains, as seen in the prophetic hope of regathering and renewal (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period who received visions from God to encourage the Israelites in rebuilding the temple and restoring their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/horns.htm">Horns</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of power and strength, often used to denote nations or leaders who have oppressed or scattered God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/craftsmen.htm">Craftsmen</a></b><br>Individuals or forces sent by God to counteract and overthrow the oppressive powers symbolized by the horns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing God's chosen people who were scattered due to their disobedience and the subsequent invasions by foreign powers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The foreign powers that have oppressed and scattered the people of Judah, often seen as enemies of God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and powers, and He raises and brings down rulers according to His divine plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice_and_protection.htm">Divine Justice and Protection</a></b><br>God will not allow His people to be oppressed indefinitely.

Historically, Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>), and the succeeding Gentile empires fulfilled this scattering (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-40</a>; 7:7-8).<p>&#8226; &#8220;So that no one could raise his head&#8221; paints total humiliation (<a href="/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13-15</a>), yet God never forgot His covenant people (<a href="/leviticus/26-44.htm">Leviticus 26:44</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores that every act of oppression against Israel is on God&#8217;s radar (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But the craftsmen have come to terrify them&#8221;</b><p>Opposing the horns are four &#8220;craftsmen&#8221;

Their task is to &#8220;terrify&#8221; the horns, showing that no earthly might intimidates heaven (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The number four hints at completeness, matching the global reach of the horns; every hostile front is answered (<a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And throw down these horns of the nations that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it&#8221;</b><p>The craftsmen will dismantle, overthrow, and nullify the hostile powers.<p>&#8226;

The message is clear: the Lord sees every blow against His people, appoints precise agents to shatter oppressors, and will finally overthrow every proud power that rises against His covenant purposes. The same God who restored post-exilic Judah will, in His perfect time, establish His kingdom in righteous glory, leaving no horn&#8212;or enemy&#8212;standing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake.</span> The interpreting angel spake. <span class="cmt_word">Which have scattered Judah.</span> The LXX. adds, "and broke Israel in pieces." <span class="cmt_word">Did lift up his head.</span> These powers laid Judah prostrate. <span class="cmt_word">To fray them.</span> To terrify the powers symbolized by the four horns, and disturb their self-complacent Security (ver. 15).
