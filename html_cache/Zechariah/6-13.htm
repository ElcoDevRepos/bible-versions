In the immediate context, it points to Zerubbabel and Joshua, who were involved in the rebuilding of the Second Temple after the Babylonian exile. However, the ultimate fulfillment is seen in Jesus Christ, who spoke of His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and is building a spiritual temple, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). The temple signifies God's presence among His people, and Christ's work establishes this presence eternally.<p><b>He will be clothed in splendor</b><br>This imagery of being clothed in splendor signifies honor, majesty, and divine approval. In biblical times, clothing often represented one's status and role. The Messiah, Jesus, is depicted in <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a> as wearing a robe reaching down to His feet, symbolizing His kingly and priestly roles. The splendor also reflects His divine nature and the glory He shares with the Father (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).<p><b>and will sit on His throne and rule.</b><br>The throne symbolizes authority and kingship. This prophecy points to the dual role of the Messiah as both King and Priest. Jesus, as the descendant of David, fulfills the promise of an eternal kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). His rule is characterized by justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). The New Testament affirms His current reign at the right hand of God (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><b>And He will be a priest on His throne,</b><br>This phrase highlights the unique combination of the kingly and priestly offices in the Messiah, which was not typical in Israel's history where kings and priests were distinct roles. Jesus, as the High Priest in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a>), intercedes for His people and offers the ultimate sacrifice for sin. His priesthood is eternal and perfect, unlike the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>and there will be peaceful counsel between the two.&#8217;</b><br>The "two" refers to the offices of king and priest, which in Christ are perfectly united. This peaceful counsel indicates harmony and cooperation in His rule, contrasting with the often contentious relationship between kings and priests in Israel's history. It also signifies the peace that Christ brings between God and humanity (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>) and among His people (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>). This peace is a hallmark of His kingdom, which is characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_branch.htm">The Branch</a></b><br>A messianic figure, often interpreted as a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, who is both king and priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_the_lord.htm">The Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>Represents the place of worship and the presence of God among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes authority and governance, indicating the rule of the messianic figure.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priesthood.htm">Priesthood</a></b><br>The role of mediating between God and man, traditionally separate from kingship in Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_counsel.htm">Peaceful Counsel</a></b><br>The harmonious relationship between the roles of king and priest, unified in the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dual_role_of_christ.htm">The Dual Role of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus fulfills both the kingly and priestly roles, bridging the gap between God and humanity.

The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, as the clause is intended to declare that Messiah should, like Melchizedek, combine the offices of Priest and King (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6, 10</a>). The counsel of peace shall be between them both. The two offices or dignities are meant, which are combined in one person. The Messiah, in his two offices of Priest and King, has one common design, to bring peace to his people (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, where see note). Other interpretations are unsuitable. Thus: There shall be harmony between Joshua and Zerubbabel; but the two are nowhere mentioned together in the paragraph, and, indeed, the statement would be superfluous. There shall be perfect concord between the two offices; but a person is spoken cf. not an abstraction. Others explain the "counsel of peace" to be between Jews and Gentiles, or the returned and the exiled Jews; but neither of these have been named. Pusey takes it to mean, "between the Father and the Son;" but there is nothing in the passage to lead to this. Kuabenhauer expounds it of those who alone are mentioned in the text, Messiah and Joshua, seeing in it an exhortation to the latter to make the type correspond to the Antitype, so that all may see that there is perfect harmony between them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yes, He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
