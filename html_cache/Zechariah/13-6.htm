In the context of <a href="/zechariah/13.htm">Zechariah 13</a>, the chapter deals with themes of purification and the removal of false prophets. The wounds mentioned here are significant as they imply a history of suffering or punishment. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, self-inflicted wounds were sometimes associated with pagan rituals or acts of mourning. The question posed indicates a confrontation or a demand for accountability, which aligns with the broader biblical theme of truth being revealed in the end times. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the questioning of Jesus Christ, who bore wounds on His body, as seen in <a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a> when Thomas is invited to see the wounds of Christ.<p><b>he will answer, &#8216;These are the wounds I received in the house of my friends.&#8217;</b><br>The response highlights a sense of betrayal or misunderstanding, as the wounds were received among friends, not enemies. This can be interpreted as a reflection of the betrayal Jesus experienced, notably by Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples. The phrase "house of my friends" suggests a place of safety and trust, which makes the betrayal more poignant. Historically, this could also refer to the internal strife within Israel, where prophets and leaders were often rejected or harmed by their own people. This mirrors the experience of many prophets in the Old Testament, such as Jeremiah, who faced opposition from his own community. Theologically, it underscores the theme of suffering and redemption, as Jesus' ultimate sacrifice was made for those He considered His own, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of being wounded for our transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who ministered to the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile.

This enigmatic figure is often interpreted as a messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_friends.htm">The House of Friends</a></b><br>This phrase suggests a place of supposed safety and trust, yet it becomes a place of betrayal and harm. It can be seen as a metaphor for the betrayal Jesus experienced from those close to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_imagery.htm">Understanding Prophetic Imagery</a></b><br><a href="/zechariah/13-6.htm">Zechariah 13:6</a> uses vivid imagery to convey deep spiritual truths.

The setting is the cleansed, restored Israel of the latter days, where idolatry and deception are no longer tolerated (13:2&#8211;3).<p>&#8226; A curious bystander questions a man who once claimed prophetic authority. Judgment is now so thorough that ordinary people feel free to challenge anyone&#8217;s past behavior. Compare <a href="/acts/19-18.htm">Acts 19:18&#8211;20</a>, where new believers openly confessed and renounced occult practices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;What are these wounds on your chest?&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;wounds&#8221; points to the ritual gashes false prophets inflicted on themselves, imitating pagan worship (<a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>). They cut &#8220;on the chest&#8221; (lit., between the hands) where the scars stay visible.<p>&#8226; Because God&#8217;s law forbade such mutilation (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), these marks expose a life once lived in rebellion. The questioner is really asking, &#8220;Why do you bear evidence of idolatry in a society now devoted to the LORD?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will answer</b><p>&#8226; In the purged kingdom the former deceiver cannot keep hiding. As <a href="/proverbs/12-19.htm">Proverbs 12:19</a> says, &#8220;Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Faced with direct scrutiny, the man offers an explanation&#8212;yet one meant to deflect full responsibility. This fulfills <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;These are the wounds I received in the house of my friends.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; On the surface he claims, &#8220;I got hurt at my friend&#8217;s house,&#8221; implying a domestic accident rather than an idolatrous ritual. He hopes to make the scars sound harmless, much like Adam&#8217;s evasive reply in <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse also carries a deeper, messianic resonance. Jesus, Israel&#8217;s true Shepherd, was betrayed &#8220;in the house of My friends&#8221; (see <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14&#8211;16</a>). After His resurrection He showed &#8220;the marks of the nails in His hands&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>). <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> confirms, &#8220;He was pierced for our transgressions,&#8221; and <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> notes, &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Thus the passage pictures two realities:<p>&#8211; The shame of false prophets who try to hide their sin once God&#8217;s cleansing has come (<a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8211; The foreshadowing of Christ, wounded yet proclaiming forgiveness even toward those who once rejected Him (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/13-6.htm">Zechariah 13:6</a> depicts a coming day when false prophets, exposed by God&#8217;s purifying work, will be confronted about their self-inflicted scars. They will invent harmless stories to cover past rebellion, yet the very sight of their wounds testifies against them. At the same time the verse echoes forward to the Messiah, whose own wounds&#8212;inflicted within His covenant people&#8212;bring salvation. The contrast invites us to forsake deceit and cling to the One whose scars speak truth and grace forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What are these wounds in thine hands?</span> or rather, <span class="accented">between thy hands</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on thy breast; Revised Version, <span class="accented">between thine arms</span>. Cheyne compares, "between his arms," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his back (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>) and "between your eyes" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on your foreheads (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>). Not satisfied with the assertion in ver. 5, the questioner asks the meaning of these wounds which he sees on his body. Jerome considers these scars to be marks of correction and punishment at the hands of his parents. More probably they are thought to be self-infilcted in the service of some idol, according to the practice mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</span> This may be a confession of guilt, the impostor owning that his friends, had thus punished him for his pretensions; or, as the word rendered "friends" is generally used in the case of illicit or impure love or spiritual fornication, it may be here applied to the idols whom he served. But it seems most probable that the answer is intentionally false and misleading; as if he had said, "The wounds were not made as you suppose, but are the result of something that happened to me in my friends' house." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "with which I was struck in my beloved house." To see in this passage a reference to our blessed Lord and his crucifixion, though such an opinion has the support of the Roman Liturgy and of many interpreters, is to do violence to the context, and to read into the words a meaning wholly alien from the subject of false prophets, which is the matter in hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If someone asks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
