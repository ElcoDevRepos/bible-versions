Ephraim, representing the northern kingdom of Israel, often relied on military might and alliances for security. The cutting off of the chariot symbolizes a shift from dependence on military prowess to reliance on divine intervention. This echoes <a href="/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a>, where God promises to save His people not by bow, sword, or battle, but by His own power.<p><b>and the horse from Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah, is similarly stripped of its military resources. Horses were a symbol of war and strength, often used in battle. The removal of horses indicates a future where trust in God supersedes reliance on military capabilities. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the name of the Lord.<p><b>and the bow of war will be broken</b><br>The breaking of the bow signifies the end of warfare and conflict. This imagery is consistent with prophetic visions of peace, such as in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where swords are beaten into plowshares. It points to a future Messianic age where peace prevails, and instruments of war are rendered obsolete.<p><b>Then He will proclaim peace to the nations</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of the Messiah's mission. The proclamation of peace extends beyond Israel to all nations, fulfilling the Abrahamic promise that through his seed all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). It anticipates the New Testament message of peace through Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-17</a>, where Jesus is described as our peace, breaking down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile.<p><b>His dominion will extend from sea to sea</b><br>This expression of dominion suggests a vast and universal reign. "From sea to sea" is a poetic way of describing totality, often used in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>) to depict the expansive rule of the Messiah. It implies a kingdom without geographical limitations, encompassing all creation.<p><b>and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth</b><br>The Euphrates River was a significant boundary in the ancient Near East, often representing the extent of Israel's promised land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Extending dominion "to the ends of the earth" suggests a kingdom that surpasses all known boundaries, indicating the global reign of the Messiah. This is fulfilled in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, asserting His authority over heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used to symbolize the entire nation of Israel. In this context, it signifies the cessation of military power and conflict within Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, representing the southern kingdom. It is a central place of worship and governance for the Jewish people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bow_of_war.htm">The Bow of War</a></b><br>Symbolizes military strength and conflict. The breaking of the bow indicates the end of warfare and the establishment of peace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations beyond Israel. The proclamation of peace to these nations signifies the universal scope of God's kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_euphrates.htm">The Euphrates</a></b><br>A major river in the ancient Near East, often used to denote the boundary of the promised land.

This trust should lead to a life of faith and hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_end_of_earthly_powers.htm">The End of Earthly Powers</a></b><br>The breaking of the bow and the cutting off of chariots symbolize the futility of relying on human strength.

From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the "house of Judah," and the "house of Israel" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The battle bow stands for all weapons of war.</span> That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (<a href="/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>; comp. <a href="/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall speak peace unto the heathen.</span> He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea even to sea.</span> Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence our passage is derived. Poetically, an Eastern sea, perhaps, is supposed to bound that side of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">From the river even to the ends of the earth.</span> From the Enphrates unto the utmost limits of the world (see <a href="/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>; <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). Both expressions obtain an unlimited significance, and show the universal extent of Messiah's kingdom; for in him, according to the promise made to Abraham, all the families of the earth should be blessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will cut off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7733;&#183;rat&#183;t&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
