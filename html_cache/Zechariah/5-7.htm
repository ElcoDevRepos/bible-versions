The use of "behold" signals the importance of what is about to be revealed. The lead cover suggests heaviness and containment, symbolizing the suppression of sin or iniquity. Lead, being a dense and heavy metal, indicates the seriousness of what is being contained. In biblical times, lead was used for various purposes, including weights and seals, which could imply the sealing of judgment or the weight of sin. The act of raising the cover signifies the revelation of hidden sin, aligning with themes of exposure and judgment found throughout prophetic literature.<p><b>and there was a woman sitting inside the basket</b><br>The woman inside the basket represents wickedness, as clarified in the subsequent verses. In the ancient Near Eastern context, women were sometimes used symbolically to represent cities or personified concepts, such as wisdom or folly. Here, the woman embodies wickedness, possibly alluding to the personification of sin or idolatry. The basket, or ephah, was a common measure for grain, suggesting commerce or trade, which could symbolize the corrupt practices prevalent in society. This imagery connects to other biblical passages where sin is personified or where women symbolize larger entities, such as Babylon in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. The vision reflects the theme of divine judgment against sin and the eventual removal of wickedness, resonating with the broader prophetic message of restoration and purification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah was instrumental in encouraging the Jewish people to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem after their return from Babylonian exile.

God wants His people to notice His active judgment against sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the cover of lead was raised</b><p>A lead lid is a weighty, unbreakable seal. Lifting it pictures God deliberately exposing what has been hidden.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a> affirms, &#8220;You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a> reinforces, &#8220;For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed.&#8221;<p>Lead also speaks of heaviness&#8212;sin carries real, measurable weight.
