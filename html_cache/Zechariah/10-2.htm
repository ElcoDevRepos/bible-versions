These idols are described as deceitful because they cannot speak truth or provide guidance. In biblical context, idolatry is consistently condemned (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The deceit of idols is contrasted with the truth of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>). The prophets frequently warned against the futility of idol worship (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<p><b>and diviners see illusions;</b><br>Diviners were individuals who claimed to predict the future or reveal hidden knowledge through various means, often associated with pagan practices. The Bible condemns divination as it leads people away from trusting in God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). The illusions seen by diviners are false visions, lacking divine truth. This phrase highlights the unreliability of human attempts to discern the future apart from God.<p><b>they tell false dreams</b><br>Dreams were sometimes considered a means of divine communication in the ancient world. However, false dreams are those that do not originate from God and lead people astray. <a href="/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25-32</a> warns against prophets who claim to have dreams from God but speak lies. The emphasis is on discerning true revelation from God versus human fabrications.<p><b>and offer empty comfort.</b><br>The comfort offered by idols and false prophets is described as empty because it lacks substance and truth. True comfort comes from God, who is described as the "God of all comfort" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). The false assurances given by idols and diviners fail to provide real peace or security.<p><b>Therefore the people wander like sheep,</b><br>Sheep are often used in the Bible as a metaphor for people, highlighting their need for guidance and protection. Without a shepherd, sheep are prone to wandering and danger. This imagery is used to describe the spiritual state of the people who have turned to idols and false prophets instead of God (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>oppressed for lack of a shepherd.</b><br>The absence of a true shepherd, a leader who guides and protects, results in oppression and suffering. In biblical terms, a shepherd symbolizes a leader or king who cares for the people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-6</a>). Jesus Christ is identified as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a>), providing the ultimate fulfillment of this need for divine leadership and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects or entities worshipped in place of the true God, often leading people astray with false promises and deceit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/diviners.htm">Diviners</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to predict the future or reveal hidden knowledge through supernatural means, often misleading people with illusions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>A metaphor for the people of Israel, symbolizing their vulnerability and need for guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>Represents leaders or guides who are meant to care for and direct the people, but whose absence leads to oppression and wandering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The state of being burdened or mistreated, often due to a lack of proper leadership or guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_false_guidance.htm">The Danger of False Guidance</a></b><br>Idols and diviners offer deceitful promises that lead people away from the truth.

Only when God&#8217;s people reject counterfeit voices and submit to the Good Shepherd do they find truth that satisfies, guidance that secures, and comfort that endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The prophet supports his exhortation to pray to Jehovah by showing the worthlessness of trust in idols. <span class="cmt_word">Idols</span>; <span class="accented">teraphim.</span> What these were is not known for certain. They seem to have been images of human form and sometimes of life size, corresponding in some degree to the lares or penates of the Romans (<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>). They were supposed to be capable of bestowing temporal blessings and giving oracles (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Have spoken vanity.</span> Gave worthless, misleading responses. The mention of teraphim in this passage is thought to indicate a date anterior to the Captivity; but the prophet is speaking of past events, of the results of these base superstitions in former, not present, time. Three kinds of superstition are mentioned. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "speaking" images. These are the first. Secondly come the soothsayers, <span class="cmt_word">the diviners,</span> persons who pretended to predict the future (<a href="/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; Habukkuk 2:18). <span class="cmt_word">Have told false dreams;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">somniatores locuti sunt frustra</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>, "spake false dreams." The Vulgate seems to be correct, "dreams, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dreamers, spake deceit." This is the third class among the practisers of superstitious observances. They comfort in vain, when they promise temporal blessings (<a href="/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they went their way as a flock.</span> Because they trusted in these vain superstitions, the Israelites had to leave their own place, were led into exile like a flock of sheep driven away for sale or slaughter (<a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They were troubled.</span> They were and are still oppressed by the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Because there was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no shepherd.</span> Because they had no king to guard and lead them, they fell under the power of foreign rulers, who ill treated and oppressed them (<a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>;
