In biblical context, a "shepherd" symbolizes a leader or king. Historically, this could refer to leaders like Herod or the Roman rulers who governed Israel harshly. Theologically, it foreshadows the coming of false leaders or the Antichrist, contrasting with Jesus, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>who will neither care for the lost</b><br>This shepherd's lack of concern for the lost sheep highlights a failure in leadership. Biblically, a good shepherd seeks out the lost (<a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4-6</a>), reflecting God's heart for the lost (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>). This phrase underscores the neglect and abandonment by those in power, contrasting with Christ's mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>nor seek the young</b><br>The young or "tender" sheep represent the vulnerable and innocent. A true shepherd protects and nurtures them (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>). This neglect signifies a betrayal of duty, emphasizing the corrupt nature of the leadership. It contrasts with Jesus' care for children and the weak (<a href="/matthew/19-14.htm">Matthew 19:14</a>).<p><b>nor heal the broken</b><br>Healing the broken is a key role of a shepherd, symbolizing restoration and compassion (<a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>). The failure to heal reflects a lack of mercy and justice, often seen in oppressive regimes. This phrase contrasts with Jesus' healing ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>) and His role as the healer of spiritual and physical brokenness.<p><b>nor sustain the healthy</b><br>Sustaining the healthy involves maintaining the well-being of the flock. This neglect indicates a complete disregard for the welfare of the people. Biblically, leaders are called to strengthen and support their people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>). This failure highlights the destructive nature of the shepherd, unlike Christ, who sustains and nourishes His followers (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>but he will devour the flesh of the choice sheep</b><br>This imagery of devouring suggests exploitation and abuse of power. The "choice sheep" represent the best and most valuable, indicating that the leader will exploit the people for personal gain. This behavior is condemned in Scripture (<a href="/micah/3.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>) and contrasts with the sacrificial nature of Christ, who gives life rather than taking it (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10-11</a>).<p><b>and tear off their hooves</b><br>Tearing off hooves implies complete destruction and incapacitation, leaving the sheep defenseless. This brutal imagery underscores the severity of the leader's oppression. It serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's true shepherd, Jesus Christ, who protects and preserves His flock (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, focusing on themes of repentance and restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>Symbolically represents leaders or rulers, often used in the Bible to describe those who are responsible for guiding and caring for God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, where the people of God reside and where the events of Zechariah's prophecy unfold.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_perishing,_scattered,_broken,_healthy.htm">The Perishing, Scattered, Broken, Healthy</a></b><br>These terms describe the various states of the people under the care of the shepherd, highlighting their needs and vulnerabilities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fat_sheep.htm">The Fat Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who are prosperous or well-off, yet still vulnerable to exploitation by corrupt leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are called to care for and nurture those under their charge, not exploit them for personal gain.

The Lord Himself allows this shepherd to emerge, showing that even corrupt leadership can serve His larger purposes of discipline and revelation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). In the immediate context, Judah&#8217;s rejection of the true Shepherd (<a href="/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4-14</a>) brings on a season of judgment. Ultimately, many conservative interpreters see in this figure a foreshadowing of the future &#8220;man of lawlessness&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>) whom God will permit for a time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will neither care for the lost</b><p>This shepherd &#8220;will neither care for the lost,&#8221; literally ignoring sheep that wander. Compare God&#8217;s indictment of faithless leaders in <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>, &#8220;You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.&#8221; Jesus sets the opposite standard in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>, leaving the ninety-nine to seek the one that is lost. The contrast underscores how far this coming shepherd will stray from God&#8217;s heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor seek the young</b><p>The word &#8220;young&#8221; highlights the most vulnerable in the flock. Good shepherds guard lambs with special vigilance (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>). By refusing to &#8220;seek the young,&#8221; the coming ruler mirrors Pharaoh&#8217;s cruelty toward Hebrew infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) and Herod&#8217;s massacre in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows that wicked regimes target the defenseless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor heal the broken</b><p>A broken or maimed sheep needs a tender hand, yet this shepherd offers no remedy. <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a> celebrates the Lord who &#8220;heals the brokenhearted&#8221;; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a> speaks of Messiah binding up the broken. The prophecy underscores a leadership that withholds compassion, reminding us that absence of mercy is a telltale sign of rebellion against God (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor sustain the healthy</b><p>Even the strong receive no nourishment. By contrast, <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2-3</a> depicts the true Shepherd leading to green pastures and still waters. Leaders who fail to feed the flock leave even the robust sheep weakened (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2</a>). Spiritually, the people starve when teaching becomes corrupt or absent (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he will devour the flesh of the choice sheep</b><p>Instead of serving the flock, this shepherd turns predator, consuming &#8220;the flesh of the choice sheep.&#8221; Jesus warns of &#8220;wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>) and identifies hired hands who exploit the flock (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>). The phrase points to persecution, economic oppression, and spiritual deception aimed at God&#8217;s elect during the end-time tribulation (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And tear off their hooves</b><p>Tearing off hooves pictures total destruction&#8212;nothing usable remains. It echoes <a href="/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>, where only &#8220;two legs or a piece of an ear&#8221; are rescued from the lion&#8217;s mouth. The image anticipates severe suffering yet also implies a remnant survival, for God never allows His people to be utterly consumed (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a> portrays a divinely permitted, utterly worthless shepherd whose leadership is the antithesis of God&#8217;s pastoral care. He neglects the wandering, the young, the broken, and even the healthy, while actively preying on the best of the flock. Historically, such figures appeared in Israel&#8217;s past; prophetically, the verse foreshadows the ultimate counterfeit shepherd whom Christ will destroy at His return (<a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>). The passage calls believers to discern true shepherds by their Christ-like care and to rest in the assurance that, despite seasons of evil rule, the Lord remains the Good Shepherd who never abandons His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will raise up a shepherd in the land.</span> God explains the reason of the symbolical character which he directed the prophet to assume. He was going to allow the people to be chastised by an instrument whom he would permit to work his will upon them. As this evil shepherd was to arise to punish them for their rejection of Messiah, he must represent some person or power that existed subsequent to Christ's death. Many consider that he symbolizes the Romans; but these people could not be deemed to exercise pastoral care over the Israelites, nor could their neglect of this (ver. 17) be attributed to them as a sin; nor, again, did their destruction follow upon the overthrow of the Jewish polity (ver. 18). Others see here a prediction of the coming of antichrist; but the character of "shepherd" does not suit his attributes as given elsewhere; at any rate. this cannot be the primary reference of the symbol, though all evil powers that oppose the Church of Christ are in some sense images and anticipations of antichrist. The genuine reference here is to the native chiefs and rulers ("in the land") who arose in the later times of the nation - monsters like Herod, false Christs and false prophets (<a href="/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 12, 24</a>; <a href="/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>), hirelings who made merchandise of the flock, teachers who came in their own name (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>), and deceived the people to their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not visit those that be cut off;</span> or, <span class="accented">those that are perishing.</span> This foolish shepherd shall perform none of the offices of a good shepherd; he will not care for and tend those that are in danger of death (<a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The young one;</span> rather, <span class="accented">those that are scattered</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dispersum</span> (<a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That that is broken.</span> Bruised, or with limb fractured. <span class="cmt_word">Feed that that standeth still;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that standeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is sound and healthy.

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "that which is whole." <span class="cmt_word">He shall eat the flesh of the fat.</span> He thinks only how to get personal advantage from the flock (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Tear their claws</span> (<span class="accented">hoofs</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in pieces,</span> as some say, by making them traverse rough places, and not caring where he led them; but as such travelling would not specially injure sheep, and as the immediate context is concerned with their treatment as food, it is better to see here a picture of a greedy and voracious man who tears asunder the very hoofs to suck out all the nourishment he can find, or one who mutilates the fattest of his flock, that they may not stray, and that he may always have a dainty morsel at hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/11-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will raise up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a shepherd</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#8216;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
