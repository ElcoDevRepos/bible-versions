The clean turban symbolizes purity and the restoration of the priesthood. In the context of the Old Testament, the high priest wore a turban as part of his sacred garments (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-39</a>). The turban, inscribed with "Holy to the LORD," signifies holiness and dedication to God. This act represents the removal of iniquity and the reinstatement of Joshua the high priest, symbolizing the cleansing and renewal of Israel. The turban also points to the future Messianic priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is both King and Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>).<p><b>So a clean turban was placed on his head,</b><br>The immediate obedience to the command highlights the divine authority and the fulfillment of God's will. The clean turban being placed on Joshua's head signifies the completion of his purification and the restoration of his priestly role. This act is a visual representation of God's grace and forgiveness, emphasizing the theme of redemption. It also prefigures the ultimate cleansing from sin through Christ's atoning sacrifice, as believers are made a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and they clothed him,</b><br>The clothing of Joshua with clean garments further underscores the theme of purification and restoration. In biblical symbolism, clothing often represents one's spiritual state (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The act of clothing Joshua signifies the removal of his iniquity and the bestowal of righteousness. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to "put on the new self" (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>) and to be clothed with Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).<p><b>as the angel of the LORD stood by.</b><br>The presence of the angel of the LORD signifies divine approval and oversight. The angel, often identified with the pre-incarnate Christ, acts as an intermediary between God and man. His standing by indicates God's active involvement and assurance in the process of restoration. This scene reflects the ongoing spiritual battle and the assurance of God's presence with His people. The angel's presence also foreshadows Christ's role as our advocate and intercessor (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>), who stands by us in our spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_the_high_priest.htm">Joshua the High Priest</a></b><br>Joshua is the central figure in this vision, representing the priesthood and the people of Israel.

Joshua&#8217;s filthy garments (v. 3) symbolized the nation&#8217;s sin; the new headgear announces complete forgiveness and restored holiness (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; By starting with the headpiece, the Lord highlights renewed authority and identity before the body is even clothed (<a href="/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So a clean turban was placed on his head</b><p>&#8226; Heaven instantly carries out the command, emphasizing that cleansing is God&#8217;s work, not human effort (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The adjective &#8220;clean&#8221; underscores total removal of defilement&#8212;no lingering guilt (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; In prophetic picture-language, Joshua represents the future Messiah&#8217;s perfected priesthood and Israel&#8217;s ultimate restoration (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they clothed him</b><p>&#8226; The rest of the garments follow, portraying full reinstatement to service (<a href="/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses new clothes for salvation imagery:<p>&#8211; Joseph robed before Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>)<p>&#8211; The prodigal given the best robe (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>)<p>&#8211; The church arrayed in fine linen, &#8220;the righteous acts of the saints&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>)<p>&#8226; God never leaves His people half-dressed; He equips for every good work (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the angel of the LORD stood by</b><p>&#8226; The Angel&#8217;s silent presence signifies approval and guardianship, much like the pillar of cloud in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture the Angel of the LORD often appears as the pre-incarnate Christ, mediating God&#8217;s grace (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11-18</a>; <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>).<p>&#8226; His standing &#8220;by&#8221; assures Joshua&#8212;and us&#8212;that God remains committed until redemption is complete (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; Jude 24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/3-5.htm">Zechariah 3:5</a> displays God&#8217;s decisive, gracious act of restoring the high priest&#8212;and by extension His people&#8212;from impurity to holiness. The clean turban crowns Joshua with renewed identity; the fresh garments confirm full acceptance; and the Angel&#8217;s presence guarantees the permanence of this divine verdict. The verse therefore assures believers that when God justifies, He also equips and stands by them, securing their calling to serve Him in spotless righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said.</span> If this is the true reading (which Ewald doubts), we must consider that the prophet, excited by what has passed, cannot stand by as a mere spectator, but feels constrained to take part in the scene, and to request that the change of garments may be completed by the addition of the fair head dress. The LXX. omits the word, continuing the address to the attendant. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">et dixit.</span> So the Syriac and the Targum and some few manuscripts. But the received reading is confirmed, as Dr. Alexander points out, by the change in the mood of the following verb from the imperative to the optative, "let them put," "would that they put." There is nothing incongruous in the prophet thus intervening in his own person. Thus Isaiah, in the midst of a solemn vision, gives vent to his feelings (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and St. John in the Apocalypse often mingles his own sentiments and actions with what he beheld (comp. <a href="/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mitre</span> (<span class="accented">tsaniph</span>); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cidarim.</span> This is not the same word as that used in <a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc. (which is <span class="accented">mitsnepheth</span>), for the official head dress of Aaron, though it is probably a synonym for it; and the prophet's wish is to see Joshua not only reinstated in his office and dignity, but found holy also. For the fair linen mitre, or tiara, was that which bore upon its front the golden plate inscribed, "Holiness unto the Lord" (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), and therefore showed that he was qualified to intercede for the people. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by.</span> The Angel of Jehovah continued standing in his place, contemplating, sanctioning, and directing what was being done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1429;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
