The "filthy garments" symbolize sin and impurity, highlighting the nation's need for cleansing and redemption. In the Old Testament, garments often symbolize one's spiritual condition (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>). The imagery of filthy garments contrasts with the priestly requirement for cleanliness (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2-3</a>), emphasizing the severity of Israel's spiritual defilement.<p><b>as he stood before the angel</b><br>The angel here is often understood to be the Angel of the Lord, a divine figure who appears throughout the Old Testament. Standing before the angel indicates a position of judgment or intercession. This scene is reminiscent of a courtroom, where Joshua stands accused, yet it also foreshadows the role of Christ as our intercessor (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The presence of the angel signifies divine authority and the potential for divine intervention and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_the_high_priest.htm">Joshua the High Priest</a></b><br>Joshua is the central figure in this vision, representing the spiritual leadership of Israel.

Just as the previous chapter closed with the promise that the Lord would again comfort Zion (<a href="/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>), &#8220;now&#8221; pivots us into the specific way God intends to do so.<p>- Scripture often uses &#8220;now&#8221; to show a turning point in God&#8217;s dealings (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9</a> &#8211; 10; <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>). Here it signals God&#8217;s immediate move from promise to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joshua</b><p>- Joshua the high priest is an actual historical figure who returned from exile with Zerubbabel (<a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>).<p>- As high priest he represents the whole nation before God, much like Aaron did in <a href="/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29</a>. What happens to him depicts what God intends for all His people.<p>- His very name, meaning &#8220;Yahweh saves,&#8221; anticipates the ultimate High Priest, Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was dressed</b><p>- Clothing in Scripture frequently symbolizes a person&#8217;s spiritual state (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>).<p>- The passive voice&#8212;&#8220;was dressed&#8221;&#8212;implies Joshua had not yet been able to change his condition; he stands as he is, awaiting God&#8217;s intervention (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a> &#8211; 6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in filthy garments</b><p>- &#8220;Filthy&#8221; conveys moral defilement. <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a> says, &#8220;All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.&#8221;<p>- For a high priest, such uncleanness was unthinkable (<a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a> &#8211; 12). The vision exposes Judah&#8217;s sin carried back from exile; ritual purity had not cured inward guilt (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a> &#8211; 8).<p>- The picture prepares the good news that God Himself will provide new garments (<a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as he stood</b><p>- &#8220;Stood&#8221; pictures Joshua fixed in place, unable to move forward or withdraw&#8212;much like sinners before a holy God (<a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a> &#8211; 4).<p>- God often calls His servants to &#8220;stand&#8221; in His presence (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>), showing accountability and readiness to receive grace or judgment.<p>- The posture also previews the believer&#8217;s future standing, made secure by Christ (<a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; Jude 24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the angel</b><p>- The Angel of the LORD appears throughout the Old Testament speaking as God yet distinct from the Father (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a> &#8211; 10; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> &#8211; 6). Many have understood this to be the pre-incarnate Christ, the divine Mediator.<p>- Joshua&#8217;s location &#8220;before the angel&#8221; stresses that cleansing must come from God Himself, not from religious effort (<a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>- The heavenly courtroom scene (<a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>) reveals that ultimate judgment happens in God&#8217;s presence, yet so does ultimate mercy (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3</a> portrays the high priest Joshua, symbolizing Israel, standing helpless in filthy sin before the divine Angel. The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s gracious act of removing those polluted garments and clothing His people with righteousness. It reminds believers today that while sin defiles, the Lord Himself provides cleansing, acceptance, and a new standing through His appointed High Priest, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with filthy garments.</span> The soiled, or dark mourning garments represent not so much the low estate to which the Aaronic priesthood had been reduced, as the defilements of sin with which Joshua was encompassed, especially, perhaps, his error in allowing his descendants to intermarry with heathens (<a href="/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>). But the sin was not only personal; he appeared laden with the guilt of the priesthood and his people. He is a type of Christ in this. Christ, indeed, was without sin; yet he bare our sins in his own body on the tree, and was made sin for us (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Some consider that the soiled garments denote the mean address in which an accused person appeared in court. But this is to import a Roman custom (comp. Livy, 2:54; 6:20) into Hebrew practice. Others deem it incongruous to make a high priest violate the decency of his office by officiating in unclean apparel. But the violation of propriety was a requirement of the vision, that thus the defilement of sin might be symbolical. <span class="cmt_word">He stood before the angel.</span> To ask his aid and protection (ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1429;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dressed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1467;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7687;u&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3847.htm">Strong's 3847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrap around, to put on a, garment, clothe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in filthy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6674.htm">Strong's 6674: </a> </span><span class="str2">Soiled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">garments</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_899.htm">Strong's 899: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covering, clothing, treachery, pillage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as he stood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;m&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Angel.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">OT Prophets: Zechariah 3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments (Zech.
