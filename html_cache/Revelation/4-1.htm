It suggests a chronological progression in the visions John receives, moving from earthly matters to heavenly ones. This transition is significant as it marks a shift in focus from the church age to future events.<p><b>I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven</b><br>The open door symbolizes access to divine revelation and insight into heavenly realities. In biblical literature, doors often represent opportunities or transitions (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>). The open door in heaven suggests that John is being granted a unique vision of God's throne room, reminiscent of similar experiences by prophets like Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1).<p><b>And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet</b><br>The voice refers back to <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>, where John first hears a loud voice like a trumpet. This voice is authoritative and commanding, often associated with divine revelation and the presence of God (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). The trumpet-like quality emphasizes the importance and urgency of the message being conveyed.<p><b>was saying, &#8220;Come up here</b><br>This invitation to "come up" signifies a call to ascend into a higher realm of understanding and revelation. It echoes similar calls to prophets in the Old Testament, such as Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>). This ascent is not just physical but spiritual, as John is being drawn into a deeper communion with God to witness future events.<p><b>and I will show you what must happen after these things.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "what must happen" indicates the certainty and divine necessity of the events to be revealed. It aligns with the prophetic nature of Revelation, which unveils God's sovereign plan for the future. This forward-looking perspective is consistent with other apocalyptic literature, emphasizing God's control over history and the ultimate fulfillment of His purposes (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who receives the vision.

It is strange that any should have maintained that this is not the voice of Christ. It is admitted that it must be the same as the voice of <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>; but it is said that the voice of Christ is heard afterwards (<a href="/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>), not as a trumpet, but as the voice of many waters. The answer is simple; the voice of Christ has many tones; and the voice like a trumpet said, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." (See <a href="/context/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10-13</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this</span>; or, <span class="accented">after these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). There is no good ground for supposing, as some do, that, after the events narrated in <a href="/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>, an interval occurred in the visions, during which St. John possibly wrote down the matter contained in the first three chapters. Nor is there any justification for assigning what follows to a time after this world. It would be pressing <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> very far to make it apply to these present things of the world; and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> certainly need not mean "the things after this world." The expression is used here in its ordinary, natural sense: "After having seen this, I saw," etc.; introducing some new phase or variety of spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">I looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">I saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). No fresh act of <span class="accented">looking</span> is signified. <span class="accented">I saw in</span> the Spirit, as formerly (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a door;</span> or, <span class="accented">and, behold, a door, and the first voice.</span> Such is the construction of the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Was opened in heaven</span>; or, <span class="accented">an open door, in heaven.</span> St. John did not see the action of opening the door, but he saw a door which had been set open, through which he might gaze, and observe what passed within. Alford contrasts <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>, where "the heaven was opened;" and supposes that the seer is transported through the open door into heaven, from which position he sees heaven, and views all that happens on the earth. Victorinus aptly compares the <span class="accented">open door</span> to the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me</span>. Omit the "was" which follows, as well as the colon which precedes, and repeat "a voice," as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">And, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which 1 heard, the voice which was, as it were, of a trumpet.</span> The voice signified is not the <span class="accented">first</span>, but the <span class="accented">former</span> voice; viz. that already heard and described in <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. The possessor of the voice is not indicated. Stier ('Reden Jesu') attributes the voice to Christ; but it seems rather that of an angel, or at any rate not that of Christ, whose voice in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> is described as "of many waters, "not as" of a trumpet." <span class="cmt_word">Which said</span>. The voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) becomes masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Though <span class="accented">whose</span> voice is not stated, yet the vividness and reality of the vision causes the writer to speak of the <span class="accented">voice</span> as the personal being whom it signifies. Come up hither. That is in the Spirit - for the apostle "immediately was in the Spirit" (ver. 2). He was to receive a yet higher insight into spiritual things (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, where St. Paul was "caught up into the third heaven"). <span class="cmt_word">And I will show thee</span>. It is not necessary, with Stier (see above on ver. 1), to infer that these words are Christ's. Though from him all the revelation comes, he may well use the ministry of angels through whom to signify his will. <span class="cmt_word">Things which must be hereafter</span>; or, <span class="accented">the things which must happen hereafter.</span> The things which it is right should happen, and which, therefore, must needs happen (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>).

The full stop may possibly be better placed before "hereafter;" in which case "hereafter" would introduce the following phrase, exactly as before in this verse.
