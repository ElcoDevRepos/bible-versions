This event signifies a pivotal moment in the cosmic struggle between good and evil. The dragon's expulsion from heaven is a fulfillment of prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-17</a>, where the fall of a proud, rebellious figure is depicted. The dragon's presence on earth indicates a shift in his focus and activity, now targeting humanity more directly.<p><b>he pursued the woman</b><br>The woman in this passage is often interpreted as representing Israel, the people of God, or the faithful remnant. This imagery draws from Old Testament symbolism, where Israel is frequently depicted as a woman or bride (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5-6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>). The dragon's pursuit of the woman signifies Satan's ongoing hostility towards God's covenant people, reflecting historical patterns of persecution and spiritual warfare against those who follow God.<p><b>who had given birth to the male child</b><br>The male child is widely understood to symbolize Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who is prophesied to rule all nations with a rod of iron (<a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>). This imagery connects to <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7-9</a>, where the Messiah is depicted as a king with authority over the nations. The birth of the male child represents the incarnation of Christ and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The dragon's pursuit of the woman and the child echoes Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-16</a>), highlighting the spiritual opposition to God's salvific work throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dragon.htm">The Dragon</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the adversary of God and His people.
