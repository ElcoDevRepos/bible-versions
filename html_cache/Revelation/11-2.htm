This area was accessible to non-Jews, symbolizing the separation between Jews and Gentiles in worship practices. The instruction to exclude this area from measurement suggests a distinction between what is considered holy and what is not. This exclusion may symbolize the temporary nature of Gentile dominion over sacred spaces, reflecting the tension between the sacred and the profane.<p><b>Do not measure it,</b><br>The act of measuring in biblical terms often signifies ownership, protection, or judgment. By instructing not to measure the courtyard, it implies that this area is not under divine protection or ownership in the same way as the inner temple. This can be seen as a symbolic act indicating that the outer court is not part of the divine plan for preservation, possibly foreshadowing judgment or desecration.<p><b>because it has been given over to the nations,</b><br>The phrase "given over to the nations" indicates a period where Gentile powers have control or influence over the holy city. Historically, Jerusalem has been under the control of various empires, including the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. This phrase may also allude to the times of the Gentiles mentioned in <a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>, where Jesus speaks of Jerusalem being trampled by Gentiles until their time is fulfilled. It reflects a period of Gentile dominance over Jerusalem, which is part of the prophetic timeline.<p><b>and they will trample the holy city</b><br>The imagery of trampling suggests desecration and oppression. The holy city, Jerusalem, holds significant religious importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the temple. The trampling by the nations can be seen as a period of persecution and suffering for the Jewish people and the city itself. This aligns with historical events such as the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and can also be interpreted as a future prophetic event.<p><b>for 42 months.</b><br>The period of 42 months, equivalent to 3.5 years, is a significant timeframe in biblical prophecy, often associated with tribulation and testing. This duration is mentioned in other prophetic contexts, such as the ministry of the two witnesses in <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a> and the persecution of the woman in <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>. It corresponds to the "time, times, and half a time" in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25 and 12</a>:7, symbolizing a limited period of suffering before divine intervention. This timeframe emphasizes the temporary nature of Gentile dominance and the eventual restoration of God's order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>In the context of Revelation, the temple represents the dwelling place of God and His presence among His people.

Measuring in Scripture often signals ownership, protection, or blessing (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3-4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-5</a>). By contrast, what is left unmeasured lies outside the special shelter of God&#8217;s covenant favor. The temple proper&#8212;symbolizing genuine worship and the people truly belonging to the Lord&#8212;is distinguished from an area that will experience different treatment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not measure it</b><p>The explicit command not to measure underlines the Lord&#8217;s intentional separation. Zechariah&#8217;s vision promised a &#8220;wall of fire&#8221; around Jerusalem, but here the outer court is denied that security. It echoes the moment in <a href="/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50</a> where only certain parts of the camp came under priestly guardianship. God&#8217;s withholding of measurement signals forthcoming turmoil rather than preservation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because it has been given over to the nations</b><p>The outer court&#8217;s fate is not random; God &#8220;has been given&#8221; it over. He remains sovereign even when allowing Gentile powers to advance (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). Jesus forecast this dynamic: &#8220;Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>). The phrase confirms a divinely set period in which non-Jewish dominion is permitted, reminding us of <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>, where God&#8217;s plan includes a season of Gentile fullness before Israel&#8217;s restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they will trample the holy city</b><p>The nations will treat Jerusalem&#8212;the geographic and prophetic center of God&#8217;s program&#8212;as though it were common ground. <a href="/isaiah/63-18.htm">Isaiah 63:18</a> laments when enemies &#8220;trampled your sanctuary&#8221;; <a href="/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a> records a similar heartache. <a href="/bsb/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a> echoes those laments, portraying literal hostility toward the earthly city during the end-time conflict (cf. <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>). Yet trampling never erases God&#8217;s claim; it only fulfills His purposes and sets the stage for Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For 42 months</b><p>The duration is precise: forty-two literal months, equating to 1,260 days or &#8220;time, times, and half a time&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>). Revelation repeats this span regarding the woman in the wilderness (12:6) and the beast&#8217;s authority (13:5). Three and a half years marks the second half of Daniel&#8217;s seventieth week (<a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>), the climactic period just before Messiah&#8217;s kingdom dawns. God fixes the limit, guaranteeing that evil&#8217;s reign is temporary and measured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a> draws a stark line: the innermost sphere of worship is measured and protected, while the outer court, Jerusalem, and its people suffer Gentile trampling for a set 42-month span. The passage assures us that God orchestrates every detail&#8212;granting limited authority to the nations, preserving a faithful remnant, and moving history toward Christ&#8217;s visible reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">But the court . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the court which is outside the Temple cast out, and measure not it; because it was given to the nations</span> (Gentiles): <span class= "ital">and they shall tread down the holy city forty and two months.</span> The outer court--meaning, perhaps, all that lies outside the Temple itself--is to be omitted. A strong word is used; the words "leave out" are far too weak. He is not only not to measure it, but he is, in a sort, to pass it over, as though reckoned profane. The reason of this is that it was given to the Gentiles. Our Lord had said that Jerusalem should be trodden down of the Gentiles (<a href="/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>); the sacred seer catches the thought and the deeper significance. There is a treading down worse than that of the conqueror. It is the treading under of sacred things when the beast-power, or the world-power in men, tramples, like the swine, the pearls of grace under their feet, and turns fiercely upon those who gave them. Such an experience must the Church of Christ undergo. The shrine shall be safe, but the spirit of the nations, though nominally Christian, will be the spirit of Gentilism, worldliness, and even of violence. In the outer court of Church life there will be "the ebbing and flowing mass," who "sit in the way of knowledge," who "stand idle in the market-place," who have no oil in their lamps, and who indirectly pave the way for utter worldliness and practical heathenism. But there is a limit to this desecration: forty and two months it is to last. The same length of time is expressed in different forms throughout the book. Sometimes we have twelve hundred and sixty days, as in <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a> and in <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm" title="And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.">Revelation 12:6</a>; at another time forty-two months, as here and in <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm" title="And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty and two months.">Revelation 13:5</a>. A similar period seems to be meant in <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a>, where a time, times, and half a time is probably a way of expressing three years and a half; all three forms describe periods of the same length--not, of course, necessarily the same period. The idea is taken from Daniel, who uses such and similar expressions (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>). This incorporation of the expressions used by Daniel is one of those hints which remind us that the laws and principles of God's government are the same in all ages: so that the principles which receive illustration in one set of historical events are likely to receive similar illustrations in after times; and that the prophecies of one era may contain seeds of fulfilments which spring to fruit in more than one age. Thus the words of Daniel were not exhausted in the age of Antiochus, nor the visions of the Apocalypse in the overthrow of any one nation or the corruptions of any one Church. So much may this constantly-recurring period of three years and a half, or forty-two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days, teach us. It is not needful, then, to take the period as an exact literal period. It is true that there have been some remarkable historical periods of this length, which various schools of interpreters have pointed out as the fulfilment of these prophecies; but there have been also remarkable blunders on the part of those who, forgetful of Christ's own warning, have tried to predict the year when certain prophecies will receive their accomplishments. It is true, also, that the future may bring us further light, and enable us to understand these descriptions of time better; but for the present, the period of forty and two months, the equivalent of three years and a half (the half of seven, the complete and divine number), is the symbol of a period limited in length, and under the control of Him who holds the seven stars and lives through the ages. It is the pilgrimage period of the Church, the period of the world's power, during which it seems to triumph; but the period of sackcloth (see <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a>) and of suffering will not last forever. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles;</span> <span class="accented">it hath been given</span> (Revised Version). Not merely "leave out," but "cast out." The "court which is without the temple" was entered only by Jews. It seems, therefore, here to signify part of the Church, but that part which is separated from the inner circle of true believers, and given over to the world, which is here symbolized by "the Gentiles." The <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, the <span class="accented">nations</span>, throughout the Apocalypse, signifies either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> all mankind whatsoever; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that portion of mankind which is left when the true Church of God is withdrawn, and therefore which embraces the unrighteous part of mankind in contrast to the godly (cf. <a href="/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; 22:22). The latter is the signification here. And the holy city shall they tread underfoot. The holy city - Jerusalem - always in the Apocalypse the type of the Church. "They shall tread" need not necessarily refer to "the nations," though the context naturally leads to this signification; but it may be impersonal, amounting to no more than "the holy city shall be trodden underfoot." St. John seems to apply the words of our Lord concerning the literal Jerusalem to the description of the fate in store for the typical Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>). "The nations" are the instrument by which the Church is trodden underfoot, and the mention of the Gentiles in connection with the apostate portion of the Church leads to the description of the oppression of the faithful by the world. The seer is bidden to take courage by a contemplation of the numbers of those preserved by God, but is warned, nevertheless, not to expect from that fact immunity for the Church from the persecution of the world. <span class="cmt_word">Forty and two months</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "and," is inserted contrary to the common practice when the larger number precedes (so also in <a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>; <a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>). This period of three years and a half is certainly symbolical. It is the half of seven years - a perfect number. It therefore denotes a broken, uncertain period; a space of time which is certainly finite, but the end of which is uncertain. This seems to point necessarily to the period of the world's existence during which the Church is to suffer oppression. This period is mentioned <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in ver. 3 under the form of twelve hundred and sixty days, where it denotes the same period that is referred to here;  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[But]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">exclude</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(ekbale)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1544.htm">Strong's 1544: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw (cast, put) out; I banish; I bring forth, produce.
