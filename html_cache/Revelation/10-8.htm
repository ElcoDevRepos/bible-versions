The voice from heaven is often associated with God's authority and revelation, as seen in other biblical instances such as the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The repetition of the voice speaking "again" suggests ongoing guidance and instruction, a theme prevalent throughout Revelation.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Go, take the small scroll</b><br>The command to "go" implies an active participation in the unfolding of divine prophecy. The "small scroll" is reminiscent of the scroll in <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a>, which only the Lamb could open. This scroll, however, is described as "small," possibly indicating a specific, contained revelation. Scrolls in biblical times were used to record important messages, and this one symbolizes a message that John is to internalize and proclaim.<p><b>that lies open in the hand of the angel</b><br>The scroll being "open" signifies that its contents are ready to be revealed and understood. The angel holding the scroll suggests a messenger of God, often seen as intermediaries between God and humanity. Angels frequently appear in Revelation, symbolizing divine intervention and the execution of God's will.<p><b>standing on the sea and on the land.&#8221;</b><br>The angel's stance on both the sea and the land symbolizes authority over the entire earth, reflecting God's sovereignty over all creation. This imagery connects to the idea of God's dominion as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, "The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and everything in it."

And I went away to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up; and it shall make bitter thy belly, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey</span>. The image of eating the roll is derived from the Old Testament. We meet with it in Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). The passage in Ezekiel is probably the basis of the present passage, and the chapter in which it occurs gives us the meaning of the symbol: the eating of the roll, or the words of the roll, is the complete mastering of the contents of the book--the digesting, as we say, its meaning, till the principles and truths are thoroughly familiar and loved. "All my words" (so runs the explanatory verse, <a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.">Ezekiel 3:10</a>) "that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears." It is similar to the Psalmist's practice: "Thy words have I hid within my heart;" he made himself so familiar with them that they were no longer a code of laws, but a constant instinct, a second nature to him. Thus preeminently should he be familiar with his Master's words and heart, saturated with his Master's principles, who is to be a witness and a prophet for his Lord. "He who would carry God's words to another must first be impressed and penetrated with them himself. He must not only hear, read, mark, and learn, but also (according to the Scriptural figure) inwardly digest them."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said</span>; and <span class="accented">the voice which I heard out of heaven</span>, [I heard] <span class="accented">again talking with me and saying.</span> The construction is irregular."
