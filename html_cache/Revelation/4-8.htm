This connection suggests a heavenly, angelic presence that serves in the immediate presence of God. The number six, often associated with imperfection in biblical numerology, here signifies completeness in their ability to serve and worship God, as they are fully equipped for their divine purpose.<p><b>and was covered with eyes all around and within.</b><br>The eyes symbolize divine insight and omniscience, indicating that these creatures are fully aware and vigilant. This imagery suggests that nothing escapes their notice, reflecting God's all-seeing nature. The eyes "all around and within" emphasize their comprehensive perception, both outwardly and inwardly, aligning with the biblical theme of God's perfect knowledge (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p><b>Day and night they never stop saying:</b><br>The continuous worship "day and night" signifies the eternal and unceasing nature of praise in heaven. This reflects the biblical understanding of time in eternity, where worship is not bound by earthly constraints. The constancy of their praise underscores the worthiness of God to receive perpetual adoration, as seen in <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy,</b><br>The thrice-repeated "Holy" emphasizes the absolute holiness of God, a concept also found in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>. This repetition signifies completeness and perfection, underscoring God's otherness and purity. Holiness is a central attribute of God, setting Him apart from all creation and highlighting His moral perfection and divine nature.<p><b>is the Lord God Almighty,</b><br>The title "Lord God Almighty" combines the covenant name of God (YHWH) with His omnipotence. This designation affirms God's supreme power and authority over all creation. The term "Almighty" (Greek: Pantokrator) is used throughout Revelation to emphasize God's sovereignty and control over the unfolding events of history (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>).<p><b>who was and is and is to come!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase encapsulates God's eternal nature, echoing the divine self-identification in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> ("I AM WHO I AM"). It highlights God's timeless existence, His presence in the past, present, and future. This assurance of God's eternal presence provides comfort and hope, especially in the apocalyptic context of Revelation, where believers are reminded of God's ultimate victory and unchanging nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_living_creatures.htm">Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are celestial beings that surround the throne of God.

Four glorious beings, laden with eyes and six-winged like Isaiah&#8217;s seraphim, surround God&#8217;s throne. Their design declares His omniscience; their wings, His swift service; their never-ending song, His infinite worth. By repeating &#8220;Holy&#8221; three times and proclaiming Him as the Almighty who spans past, present, and future, they invite every believer to join in continual, reverent, joy-filled praise of the eternal Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And the four beasts </span>(or, <span class= "ital">living beings)</span> <span class= "bld">had each of them </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">one by one of them)</span> <span class= "bld">six wings about him; and they were full of </span>(or, <span class= "ital">teeming with)</span> <span class= "bld">eyes.</span>--The last verse spoke of the living beings teeming with eyes; this tells us that neither the dropping nor the raising of their wings hindered their view.<p><span class= "bld">And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almightly, which was, and is, and is to come.--</span>The resemblance to Isaiah's vision (<a href="/context/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1-4</a><span class= "ital">)</span> may remind us that the voice of God's creation has in every age proclaimed His eternal holiness. The word "holy" is repeated eight times in the Sinaitic version. The "six wings" are taken to express reverence, for with twain (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>) he covered his face; humility, for with twain he covered his feet; and obedience, for with twain he did fly. Some have understood these living beings to betoken rather the creative power of God than the actual creation. There is much to be said for this; but the analogy of the passage suits better the view here adopted. The twenty-four elders represent, not the regenerating power of God, but the regenerate Church. The new creation in Christ Jesus join in praise with all created things. The doxology in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a> favours the interpretation, "Thou hast created all things."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within.</span> The stop should probably be after wings: <span class="accented">are full of eyes about and within.</span> In <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> we have "six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." These actions appear to indicate reverence, humility, obedience. The eyes denote ceaseless activity. And they rest not day and night, saying. In the Authorized Version "day and night" is attached to "rest not." but probably should be taken with "saying," for, if connected with the negative phrase, "nor" would be more likely to occur than "and." But the point is practically immaterial, since the sense of the passage is the same in both readings. These representatives of <span class="accented">life</span> display the characteristics of life in its fullest energy. They have no part in anything which savours of death - no stillness, rest, or sleep. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy.</span> The thrice-repeated "holy" has very generally been held to indicate the Trinity of the Godhead. Such is evidently the intention of the English Church in ordering this passage to be read in the Epistle for Trinity Sunday. This ascription of praise is often, though wrongly, spoken of as the "Trisagion." <span class="cmt_word">Lord God Almighty</span>. "Almighty" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, the "All-Ruler," not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "All-Powerful." The former, as Bishop Pearson says, embraces the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which was, and is, and is to come.</span> This phrase is no doubt intended to attribute to God the quality of eternal existence. But it may also symbolize three aspects or departments of God's dealings with mankind: the <span class="accented">creation</span>, which has been effected by the Father; the <span class="accented">redemption</span>, which is now occurring by the intercession of the Son; and the final perfect <span class="accented">sanctification</span> by the Holy Ghost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">each</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7955;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
