Angels in Revelation often serve as messengers of God's judgment and are symbolic of divine intervention. The sequence of angels emphasizes the urgency and importance of their messages. The number three in biblical terms often signifies completeness or divine perfection, suggesting the fullness of God's warning to humanity.<p><b>calling out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies the importance and urgency of the message. In biblical literature, a loud voice often accompanies divine proclamations or significant announcements (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 5</a>:2). This ensures that the message is heard by all, symbolizing the universal scope of the warning.<p><b>If anyone worships the beast and its image</b><br>The beast represents the antichrist and the worldly systems opposed to God, as described in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. Worshiping the beast and its image signifies allegiance to these systems and rejection of God. This act of worship is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and is seen as idolatry. The image of the beast is reminiscent of the idolatrous practices in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar's image was to be worshiped.<p><b>and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand</b><br>The mark of the beast is a symbol of loyalty and submission to the antichrist's authority. The forehead and hand signify thoughts and actions, indicating total allegiance. This mark contrasts with the seal of God on the foreheads of the faithful (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>), highlighting the choice between following God or the antichrist. The historical context of Roman times, where emperors demanded worship and allegiance, provides a backdrop for understanding the implications of receiving such a mark.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_angel.htm">The Third Angel</a></b><br>This angel is the third in a sequence of three angels delivering messages in <a href="/bsb/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>.

This third angel naturally follows the other two, which describe the powers which are in conflict: the word of God, and the Babylon of the world; the gospel will triumph; Babylon is doomed; hence comes the warning that men should not identify themselves with the city of worldliness, falsehood, and sin. The reference to the wild beast, the image, and the mark, carries us back to the last chapter, and shows us that Babylon is only another aspect of the work of God's enemies: it is the city of the world-power. The warning not to receive the mark is a declaration that man, individual man, is responsible: there is no necessity for his receiving the mark, the hall-mark of a cowardly connivance at wrong-doing, or for setting his judgments by the fashions of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">and another, a third angel, etc.</span> (see on ver. 8).
