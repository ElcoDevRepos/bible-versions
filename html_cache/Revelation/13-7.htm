The term "beast" is often interpreted as a symbol of oppressive political power or a specific end-times figure, possibly the Antichrist. The saints refer to believers who remain faithful to God during this period. This echoes <a href="/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>, where a similar figure makes war against the holy people. The permission granted to the beast suggests a temporary and controlled period of tribulation, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty even over evil.<p><b>and to conquer them</b><br>The conquering of the saints does not imply a spiritual defeat but rather a physical or temporal one. Historically, the church has faced persecution, and this phrase may reflect the ultimate test of faith for believers. This is reminiscent of Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>, where He warns of persecution for His followers. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the call to endure to the end.<p><b>and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the global reach and influence of the beast's power. The language mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, highlighting a contrast between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the beast. The universality of the beast's authority suggests a time of unprecedented global unity under a single oppressive regime, which is a common theme in eschatological interpretations. This also reflects the Tower of Babel narrative in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, where humanity's unity was used for rebellion against God, leading to divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of a powerful, evil entity or system that opposes God and His people.
