The bowls parallel the plagues in Egypt, highlighting God's power and judgment against sin.<p><b>on the great river Euphrates,</b><br>The Euphrates River is one of the most significant rivers in the Bible, often symbolizing a boundary or barrier.

Just as the trumpet judgments were sequential (<a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8&#8211;11</a>), so the bowl judgments move inexorably toward the Lord&#8217;s return (15:1; 19:11-16).

God has parted waters before to accomplish His purposes; here He removes a natural barrier so that coming armies can advance unhindered. <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a> speaks of the LORD&#8217;s hand &#8220;over the River&#8221; to &#8220;strike it into seven streams,&#8221; illustrating divine control of geography.

(See Notes on <a href="/revelation/9-14.htm" title="Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.">Revelation 9:14</a>.) In the great age-long struggle between the kingdoms of Christ and the world the Euphrates represents the great separating boundary between the two kingdoms, as the literal Euphrates formed the barrier between Israel and the hostile northern and eastern kingdoms. It is the great impediment to war. It is true that there is a great interposed boundary of public opinion, which restrains evil from breaking forth in its ruder and more violent forms. Men may be hostile to spiritual religion, yet they scarcely like to shock public sentiment, or to incur the charge of depraving public morals; but there may come a time, after false principles have been taught, corrupt manners tolerated, and the light of better things darkened, when the public sentiment loses all sense of shame, and the decorums of life, which have acted as a breakwater against the tide of outrageous evil, are swept away: then is the Euphrates dried, and then may the hostile powers of evil, unrestrained by any considerations, unchecked by the popular conscience, cross boldly over and invade the whole sacred soil of human life. There have been times like this when shameless sin has walked forth, secure of public favour, to desecrate every sanctuary of purity and faith--when the most barbarous manners and the most unscrupulous violations of public faith and morals have been not only tolerated, but applauded. The "kings of the east" (or <span class= "ital">of the sun-rising</span>) represent the forces of rude and open evil which have been long restrained. As the four barbarian and tyrant kings (<a href="/context/genesis/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;">Genesis 14:1-24</a>) from the East invaded the land of promise in Abraham's days, so the leaders of open and violent hate of right, purity, and Christ, have the way of their advance prepared. But certain agencies <span class= "ital">go</span> forth to bring about this uprising of rude revolt against every sanctity of life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river:Euphrates.</span> Omit "angel" (see on previous verses). (On the <span class="accented">Euphrates</span>, see on Revelation 9:14.) This river also figures in the sixth trumpet vision, and possesses the same signification in both places. It is the natural direction from which enemies arise; and it derives this signification from the fact that the enemies of the Jews often came from that direction. The next sentence leaves no doubt that this is the meaning, and supports the view taken of <a href="/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>. It is to be noticed that, though the vial is poured out upon the Euphrates, it is not with the purpose of inflicting injury on the river, but upon the men who are thus laid open to the attacks of their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">And the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</span> The Revised Version gives the sense more plainly, <span class="accented">That the way might be made ready for the kings that</span> [<span class="accented">come</span>] <span class="accented">from the sunrising.</span> The meaning is that a barrier that wards off hostile hosts is removed. The "kings of the cast" represent God's judgments; those who are laid open to attack are the adherents of the beast. The imagery may be derived: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> From the fact (as explained in <a href="/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>, which see) that the enemies of the Jews generally came from beyond the Euphrates. This accounts for the employment of this figure in <a href="/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a>, and may reasonably be considered to contain the same allusion here. In this case the minor details do not agree; the idea is merely to convey the central fact of an advance of enemies. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> From the historical fact of the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, by means of a diversion of the waters of the Euphrates - a circumstance referred to in <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31, 32</a>, etc.; <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27, 28</a>. In this case the details are more in accordance with the general symbolism of the Apocalypse. Babylon would signify the kingdom of the beast (as in ver. 19). The <span class="accented">kings of the east</span> would still represent God's judgments, which now assail the kingdom of Satan. Satan attempts to meet this assault by the three spirits, which gather kings from the whole world (ver. 14) to battle against the Almighty. The "kings of the east" are certainly the forces ranged on the side of God. Many writers see an allusion to Christ and the saints. The sun is a frequent figure of Christ in Scripture (cf. <a href="/malachi/4-4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and Zechariah 6:12, LXX.; <a href="/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; also <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>). "The kings of the east" may thus be identified with the armies of <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
