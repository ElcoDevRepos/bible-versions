The "seven stars" are later identified as the angels or messengers of the seven churches (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>). This imagery suggests Christ's sovereign control and protection over the churches. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in biblical literature, indicating the fullness of the church. The stars being in His hand signifies His intimate involvement and care for the church's leadership and guidance.<p><b>and a sharp double-edged sword came from His mouth</b><br>The "sharp double-edged sword" represents the Word of God, which is described as living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).

The sword coming from His mouth indicates that His judgments and decrees are executed through His spoken word, aligning with the prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, where the Messiah's breath or word brings justice and defeat to His enemies.<p><b>His face was like the sun shining at its brightest</b><br>This description of Christ's face reflects His divine glory and majesty, reminiscent of the transfiguration account where Jesus' face shone like the sun (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The brightness of the sun symbolizes purity, holiness, and the overwhelming presence of God. In the Old Testament, similar imagery is used to describe encounters with God's glory, such as Moses' face shining after speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>).

These Churches are as planets, which shine, not with their own light, but that of the sun; which shine most brightly in the night of "tribulation," which (like him who holds them in his right hand) are a guide to the wanderer, and are ever moving, yet ever at rest. <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword</span>. This metaphor runs through both Old and New Testaments. It is frequent in this book (<a href="/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15, 21</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, etc.). The sharp words of men and the searching words of God are both spoken of under this figure of the sword. Tertullian and Richard of St. Victor explain the two edges as the Law and the Gospel. Other still more fanciful explanations have been given. "Two-edged" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is literally "two-mouthed," and perhaps expresses no more than the thorough efficiency of the sword. It occurs in <a href="/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a> and <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; also in classical Greek as equivalent to the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. If a double meaning be insisted on, it may be found in the double character of God's Word, which not only smites the wicked, but searches the good; which cuts sometimes to punish, sometimes to heal. Thus in these very epistles to the Churches, penetrating words both of blessing and condemnation are uttered. The word for "sword" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs six times in Revelation; elsewhere in the New Testament only <a href="/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>. In classical Greek it is the heavy Thracian broadsword. In the LXX. it is used of the "flaming sword" of the cherubim which kept the way of the tree of life (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); also of the sword of Goliath (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>:25). <span class="cmt_word">His countenance was as the sun shineth</span>. It is the "Sun of Righteousness" and "the Light of the world." The exceptional glory of the Transfiguration has become constant now. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He held</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
