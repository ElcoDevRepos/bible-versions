It echoes the words of Jesus in the Gospels, particularly in <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a> and <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His teachings. The "ear" symbolizes the ability to perceive spiritual truths, suggesting that not everyone will comprehend or accept the message. The "Spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit, who guides and instructs the believers. The "churches" are the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation, representing the universal church throughout history. This phrase underscores the communal aspect of the message, indicating that it is relevant to all believers, not just individuals.<p><b>To the one who overcomes,</b><br>The term "overcomes" is a recurring theme in Revelation, referring to those who remain faithful to Christ despite trials and persecution. It implies a spiritual victory over sin, the world, and Satan. This concept is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, where He assures His followers of victory through Him. The overcomer is promised rewards, emphasizing the importance of perseverance in the Christian faith.<p><b>I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life</b><br>The "tree of life" is a symbol of eternal life and divine blessing, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a> in the Garden of Eden. Its presence in Revelation signifies the restoration of what was lost due to sin. Eating from the tree represents partaking in the fullness of life that God intended for humanity. This promise connects to the hope of eternal life found in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the living bread that gives life.<p><b>in the Paradise of God.</b><br>"Paradise" is a term used to describe a place of perfect peace and communion with God. It is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, a place of original harmony between God and humanity. In <a href="/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, Jesus uses the term "paradise" to assure the repentant thief on the cross of his place in the afterlife. The "Paradise of God" in Revelation signifies the ultimate restoration and fulfillment of God's kingdom, where believers will dwell eternally with Him. This promise reflects the eschatological hope of a new creation, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where God will dwell with His people in a renewed heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's message to the churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches.htm">The Churches</a></b><br>Specifically, the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation, representing the universal church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_overcomer.htm">The Overcomer</a></b><br>Believers who remain faithful and victorious in their spiritual journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_life.htm">The Tree of Life</a></b><br>Symbolizes eternal life and fellowship with God, first mentioned in Genesis.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradise_of_god.htm">The Paradise of God</a></b><br>Represents the restored Eden, a place of eternal communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_the_spirit.htm">Listening to the Spirit</a></b><br>The phrase "He who has an ear, let him hear" emphasizes the importance of spiritual discernment and attentiveness to the Holy Spirit's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_overcome.htm">The Call to Overcome</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to persevere in faith and righteousness, overcoming trials and temptations through the power of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_eternal_life.htm">Promise of Eternal Life</a></b><br>The reward for overcoming is access to the Tree of Life, symbolizing eternal life and restored fellowship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/paradise_restored.htm">Paradise Restored</a></b><br>The promise of the "paradise of God" points to the ultimate restoration and fulfillment of God's plan for humanity, echoing the original creation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_hear_the_Spirit_today.htm">How can we "hear what the Spirit says" in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_overcomes_in_Christian_life.htm">What does "to the one who overcomes" mean in a Christian's life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Tree_of_Life_Genesis_eternal_link.htm">How does the "tree of life" connect to Genesis and eternal life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_overcome_spiritual_challenges.htm">In what ways can we overcome spiritual challenges in our faith journey?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_2_7_Persevere_through_trials.htm">How does Revelation 2:7 encourage perseverance in the face of trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_the_one_who_overcomes.htm">What does "the one who overcomes" mean in Revelation 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Link_Revelation_2_7_to_eternal_life.htm">How does Revelation 2:7 relate to the concept of eternal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_tree_of_life_in_Rev_2_7.htm">What is the significance of the "tree of life" in Revelation 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_pleading_my_cause_to_god.htm">What reward awaits those who overcome?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_paradise_defined.htm">How is paradise defined?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_reward_awaits_those_who_overcome.htm">What reward awaits those who overcome?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_did_eden_have_two_trees.htm">What was the purpose of Eden's two trees?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 2:7 Mean</div><b>He who has an ear</b><p>Jesus opens with a familiar invitation.

The promise of the tree of life is appropriate (1) to the virtue commended: those who had not indulged in the license of Nicolaitanes shall eat of the tree of life; (2) to the special weakness of the Ephesians: to those who had fallen, and lost the paradise of first loving communion and fellowship with God (comp. <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm" title="And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.">Genesis 3:8</a>, and <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>), is held out the promise of a restored paradise and participation in the tree of life. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm" title="In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.">Revelation 22:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm" title="And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:">Genesis 3:22</a>.) This boon of immortality is the gift of Christ--I will <span class= "ital">give.</span> It is tasted in knowledge of God and of His Son (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>); it is enjoyed in their presence (<a href="/context/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3-4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear, let him hear</span>. These solemn conclusions of these epistles remind us of the conclusion of many of Christ's parables (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9, 23</a>, [7:16]; <a href="/luke/8-8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="/luke/14-35.htm">Luke 14:35</a>; not in St. John's Gospel, in which there are no parables). It is very noteworthy that, although the epistle is addressed in each case to a Church in the person of its angel, yet the concluding exhortation and promise are always addressed to the individual Christian. Each must hear for himself. His Church may perish, yet, if he overcomes, he shall live. His Church may be crowned with eternal life, yet, if he is overcome, he will lose the reward. <span class="cmt_word">What the Spirit saith to the Churches</span>; not "what he saith to <span class="accented">this</span> Church." The contents of each epistle are for all; for each individual Christian and for the Church at large, as well as for the particular Church addressed in the epistle. The epistle in each case is not from John, who is only the instrument, but from the Son of God and from the Spirit of God (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). In the first three epistles the exhortation to hearken <span class="accented">precedes</span> the promise to the victor; in the four last it <span class="accented">follows</span> the promise, and closes the epistle. Is this change of arrangement accidental or deliberate? There should be a full stop at "Churches." In the Authorized Version it looks as if "what the Spirit saith" were confined to the promise in the second half of the verse. This error was avoided by Tyndale and Cranmer. It comes from the Genevan and the Rhemish Versions. The verb to "overcome" or "conquer" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>) is strongly characteristic of St. John. It occurs seven times in the Gospel and the First Epistle, and sixteen times in the Revelation; elsewhere only in <a href="/luke/11-22.htm">Luke 11:22</a>; <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a> (quotation from <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and Romans 12:21; comp. especially Revelation 21:7, where, as in these epistles, it is not stated <span class="accented">what</span> is to be overcome. We might render, "to the victor," or "to the conqueror." The expression, "tree of life," of course comes from Genesis; we have it again in <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>. It means the tree which gives life. So also "the water of life" (<a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) and "the bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). In all these cases "life" is <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, the vital principle which man shares with God, not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the life which he shares with his fellow men. The latter word occurs less than a dozen times in the New Testament; the former, which sums up the New Testament, occurs more than a hundred times. The Paradise of God. The word "Paradise" occurs only thrice in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>). It is of Persian origin, and signified a park or pleasure ground. In the New Testament it seems to mean the resting place of departed saints. There is strong evidence (B, versions, Cyprian, Origen) in favour of reading, "the Paradise of <span class="accented">my</span> God" (see notes on Revelation 3:2, 12). In considering this passage, <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> should be carefully compared with <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>. "For him who conquers" the curse which barred Adam from the tree of life will be revoked by Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
