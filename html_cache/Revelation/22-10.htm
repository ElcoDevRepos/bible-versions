The angel serves as a divine intermediary, delivering God's message to John. This reflects the common biblical theme of angels acting as messengers, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a> and <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>.<p><b>Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book</b><br>Unlike the command given to Daniel to seal up his prophecy until the end times (<a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>), John is instructed to keep the prophecy open and accessible. This suggests an immediacy and relevance to the message, emphasizing that its contents are meant to be understood and acted upon by the contemporary audience. The open nature of the prophecy underscores the transparency of God's revelation and the urgency of its message.<p><b>Because the time is near</b><br>This phrase highlights the imminence of the events described in Revelation. The concept of "nearness" in biblical prophecy often conveys a sense of urgency and calls for readiness, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11-12</a>. It reflects the early Christian belief in the imminent return of Christ, encouraging believers to live in a state of preparedness and faithfulness.
