The angel here is a significant figure, possibly representing a messenger of God. In biblical context, angels often serve as intermediaries between God and humans, delivering messages or executing divine will. John's approach to the angel reflects a readiness to receive and understand God's revelation, a theme consistent throughout the prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a>, where Daniel receives insight from the angel Gabriel.<p><b>&#8220;Give me the small scroll.&#8221;</b><br>The small scroll is a symbol of divine revelation and prophecy. In the context of Revelation, scrolls often contain important messages from God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a>, where the Lamb opens the scroll with seven seals. The act of requesting the scroll signifies John's role as a prophet, tasked with receiving and conveying God's message to the people. This mirrors the experience of Ezekiel in <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-3</a>:3, where he is also given a scroll to eat, symbolizing the internalization of God's word.<p><b>&#8220;Take it and eat it,&#8221; he said.</b><br>The command to eat the scroll is symbolic of internalizing God's message. Eating the scroll represents the process of fully absorbing and understanding the divine revelation, making it a part of oneself. This act is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/3.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>, where Ezekiel is instructed to eat a scroll filled with words of lamentation and woe. The consumption of the scroll signifies the prophet's complete acceptance and embodiment of the message, preparing him to deliver it to others.<p><b>&#8220;It will make your stomach bitter,</b><br>The bitterness in the stomach symbolizes the difficult and often harsh realities of the prophetic message. While the word of God is sweet and desirable, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>, the implications of the message can be challenging and distressing. This duality reflects the nature of prophecy, which often includes both judgment and hope. The bitterness may also represent the persecution and suffering that often accompany the proclamation of God's truth, as experienced by prophets throughout biblical history.<p><b>but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.&#8221;</b><br>The sweetness in the mouth highlights the initial delight and desirability of receiving God's word. This sweetness is akin to the joy and satisfaction found in understanding and experiencing God's truth, as described in <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>. The contrast between the sweetness in the mouth and the bitterness in the stomach underscores the complexity of the prophetic message, which is both a source of joy and a burden. This duality is a common theme in the prophetic tradition, where the message of God brings both comfort and challenge to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives visions and instructions from God through angels.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A mighty angel who stands with one foot on the sea and one on the land, symbolizing authority over the earth.

The angel&#8217;s directive teaches that God&#8217;s word is both delightful and demanding&#8212;sweet to embrace, yet sobering when its full implications settle in. As we, like John, take the Scripture to heart, we find joy in God&#8217;s revelation and a holy burden for those who must hear its warning and its promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book;</span> <span class="accented">and I went away to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.</span> Alford understands that the seer goes from his position in heaven to the angel on earth. But he is probably, in his vision, already on the earth (see on ver. 1). And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; <span class="accented">he saith.</span> This part of the vision is founded on <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-3:3</a>. The act is no doubt intended to convey the idea that the seer is to carefully receive, to digest thoroughly, as it were, his message in order to deriver it faithfully. Thus in <a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a> the prophet is told, "All my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey;</span> cf. the vision of <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>-3, where the sweetness only is immediately mentioned; but the bitterness is implied later on in <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>. The sweetness expresses the pleasure and readiness with which St. John receives his commission; the bitterness symbolizes the grief which possesses him when he thoroughly takes in the nature of his message. The pleasure with which he receives the angel's commands may proceed from joy at the thought that the final overthrow of the wicked is the final deliverance of the saints; or it may be that he feels himself honoured at being chosen as the medium for conveying God's message. Compare the readiness of <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a> to fulfil a similar office, and his subsequent fear and hesitation (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). The bitterness of the seer follows when he realizes the terrible nature of the judgment he is to announce (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>, "For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt"). Various other explanations, more or less allegorical, have been suggested. Thus Andreas explains that the first sweetness of sin is afterwards converted into bitterness. Origen, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "Very sweet is this the book of Scripture when first perceived, but bitter to the conscience within." Maurice supposes that St. John's joy proceeds from the expectation that the book will announce the fall of the great Babel empire of the world, and his disappointment follows when he discovers that it predicts the fall of Jerusalem. Bede explains that the bitterness in the belly indicates the reception by the seer, but the sweetness in the mouth is the declaration to others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;ltha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
