The concept of a "new heaven and a new earth" signifies a complete transformation and renewal of the current creation, free from the corruption and decay introduced by sin. This vision aligns with the eschatological hope found throughout Scripture, where God restores and redeems His creation. The use of "new" implies not just a replacement but a qualitative transformation, indicating a perfected state of existence.<p><b>for the first heaven and earth had passed away</b><br>The passing away of the first heaven and earth signifies the end of the current world order, which is marred by sin and suffering. This aligns with <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>, where the apostle Peter describes the heavens passing away with a roar and the elements being destroyed by fire, leading to the expectation of a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells. The imagery suggests a purging and renewal process, emphasizing the transient nature of the present world in contrast to the eternal nature of the new creation.<p><b>and the sea was no more</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, the sea often symbolized chaos, danger, and separation. In biblical literature, the sea is sometimes associated with evil and opposition to God's order, as seen in the chaotic waters subdued in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and the sea monster Leviathan in <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>. The absence of the sea in the new creation symbolizes the removal of chaos, danger, and separation, reflecting a state of perfect peace and harmony.

Earlier prophets had sanctioned the hope: Isaiah had told of new heavens and new earth (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>); Ezekiel had closed his prophecy with the splendid vision of a renewed land of promise (Ezekiel 40-48); Christ Himself had spoken of the era which He inaugurated as the regeneration (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>); His followers soon caught the truth that the outcome of the gospel age would be the realisation of all those marvellous visions with which prophets had sustained the fainting hopes of the people of God. The hope was not to be for ever receding as new height after height was surmounted. It will not always be said, "The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth" (<a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm" title="Son of man, what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?">Ezekiel 12:22</a>). The fulfilment may seem to tarry; the unbelieving might doubt or scoff (<a href="/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>); but those who felt that the gospel was a power of spiritual regeneration, making all things new (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>), learned to look forward to the widest and fullest restoration, and to expect new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>). The characteristic word which runs throughout the description is the word "<span class= "ital">new."</span> All things are to be made <span class= "ital">new:</span> the heavens and earth are <span class= "ital">new;</span> the Jerusalem is <span class= "ital">new.</span> There are two words which are translated <span class= "ital">new</span> in our English version: one of these (<span class= "ital">neos</span>) relates to time; the other (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) relates to quality. The one would be applied to what had recently come into existence; the other to what showed fresh features. The tomb, for example, in which our Lord's body was laid was new, not in the sense that it had been recently hewn out of the rock, but in the sense that it had never been used before; it may have been long made, but it was one wherein never man was yet laid. To describe it the second word (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) is used (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm" title="And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.">Matthew 27:60</a> and <a href="/john/19-41.htm" title="Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.">John 19:41</a>). In the same way, the wine-skins (called "bottles" in our English version) required for the new wine were not necessarily wine-skins only just prepared for service, but they were skins which had not grown withered, but retained their freshness and elasticity. Here, again, the second word (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) is employed to describe them. Now, it is this latter word which is used throughout this chapter, and, indeed, throughout the book of Revelation. The newness which is pictured is the newness of freshness: the old, decaying, enfeebling, and corrupting elements are swept away. The aspects and features which will surround the inhabitants of that new earth will be full of novelty to satisfy the progressive instincts of our nature; but the imagery no less conveys the assurance that the conservative instinct, which clings to what is old, and finds sanctity in the past, will not be disregarded. All things may be new, full of fresh and fair beauty; but all things will not be <span class= "ital">strange;</span> there must be some correspondency between the old and the new, when the new things are called new <span class= "ital">heavens, </span>new <span class= "ital">earth, </span>new <span class= "ital">Jerusalem.</span> The description is figurative, but the spirit of it implies that in the restitution age the sweetness of things loved and familiar will blend with the charm of all that is fresh and new. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> The usual introduction to a new vision (cf. <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>, etc.).

Some interpret the <span class="accented">sea</span> symbolically of the restless, unstable, wicked nations of the earth, which now exist no longer; others understand the absence of <span class="accented">sea</span> to typify the absence of instability and wickedness in the New Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a new</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kainon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2537.htm">Strong's 2537: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fresh, new, unused, novel.
