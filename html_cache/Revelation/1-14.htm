In biblical literature, white often represents holiness and righteousness. The imagery of wool connects to the sacrificial lamb, a type of Christ, emphasizing His role as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. This description parallels <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, where the Ancient of Days is depicted with white hair, suggesting divine wisdom and eternal nature. The whiteness signifies the purity and sinlessness of Christ, reinforcing His divine authority and eternal existence.<p><b>as white as snow</b><br>The comparison to snow further emphasizes purity and holiness. Snow, often used in Scripture to denote cleansing and forgiveness (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), highlights the sinless nature of Christ. This imagery assures believers of the complete purity and righteousness of Jesus, who is both judge and redeemer. The use of snow, a natural element, also connects to the divine creation, underscoring the Creator's power and majesty.<p><b>and His eyes were like a blazing fire</b><br>The eyes of blazing fire symbolize penetrating vision and judgment. Fire in the Bible often represents God's presence and purifying power (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). This imagery suggests that Christ sees all, with nothing hidden from His sight, and He judges with perfect righteousness. The fire also indicates His zeal and passion for holiness and justice. This description connects to <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, where Christ is depicted as a warrior king, emphasizing His role as the righteous judge who discerns the hearts and minds of all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, depicted in a vision given to John.

This evokes the vision of &#8220;the Ancient of Days&#8221; in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>: &#8220;His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool.&#8221;<p>- The similarity with the Father underlines Christ&#8217;s full deity, eternal existence, and perfect unity with the One on the throne (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p>- White hair in Scripture also speaks of venerable wisdom. <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a> reminds us, &#8220;Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness.&#8221; Jesus possesses all wisdom from eternity past (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>), and His appearance broadcasts that truth without a word.<p>- &#8220;Like wool&#8221; calls to mind the gentleness of a lamb, fitting for the One called &#8220;the Lamb who was slain&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>), yet now risen and reigning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As white as snow</b><p>- John doubles the description for emphasis: the whiteness overwhelms. <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> offers the invite, &#8220;Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.&#8221; The spotless purity John sees in Christ is the very purity He imparts to all who trust Him (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>- At the Transfiguration &#8220;His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than any launderer on earth could bleach them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>). The same glory that once briefly burst forth on the mount now blazes unhindered in heaven.<p>- Snow imagery also pictures victory and celebration&#8212;as when saints in Sardis are promised to &#8220;walk with Me in white&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). Christ&#8217;s own purity guarantees ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His eyes were like a blazing fire</b><p>- Fire both illuminates and consumes. Nothing hides from Jesus&#8217; gaze: &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). His eyes expose motives and judge justly.<p>- <a href="/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a> repeats the phrase when Jesus addresses Thyatira, showing that the one who speaks to churches still sees them with those same flaming eyes. And verse 23 concludes, &#8220;All the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds.&#8221;<p>- Fire also purifies precious metal. <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2&#8211;3</a> pictures the Lord as &#8220;a refiner&#8217;s fire,&#8221; purging dross. Believers find comfort here: His searching eyes refine us, burning away sin while preserving what is eternal (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p>- <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a> gives a parallel glimpse: &#8220;His eyes were like flaming torches.&#8221; The continuity between Daniel&#8217;s vision and John&#8217;s assures us that we are dealing with the same glorious Person and the same unchanging authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a> paints a threefold portrait of Jesus: eternal and all-wise (white hair), utterly pure and triumphant (snow-white radiance), and all-seeing, refining Judge (eyes like blazing fire). The verse calls us to awe, worship, and wholehearted surrender to the One whose glory is both comforting and consuming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow.</span>--The whiteness here is thought by some to be the token of the transfiguration in light of the glorified person of the Redeemer. "It is the glorious white which is the colour and livery of heaven." This doubtless is true; but it appears to me a mistake to say that there is no hint here of age. It is argued that the white hair of age is a token of decay, and that no such token would have place here; but surely this is straining a point, and making a mere emblem an argument. Age and youth alike have their glories; the glory of young men is their strength; the hoary head, too, the token of experience, dignity, authority, is the glory of age. Physically, white hair may be a sign of decay; typically it never is, else the effort to produce the appearance of it in the persons of monarchs and judges would never have been made. The white head is never in public sentiment other than the venerable sign of ripe knowledge, mature judgment, and solid wisdom; and as such it well betokens that full wisdom and authority which is wielded by the Ancient of Days, who, though always the same in the fresh dew of youth, is yet <span class= "ital">from</span> everlasting, the captain of salvation, perfect through suffering, radiant in the glorious youthhood of heaven, venerable in that eternal wisdom and glory which He had with the Father before the world. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>.) "He was one," Saadias Gaon beautifully says, "with the appearance of an old man, and like an old man full of mercies. His white hair, His white garments, indicated the pure, kind intentions He had to purify His people from their sins."<p><span class= "bld">His eyes were as a flame of fire.</span>--Comp. <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm" title="His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.">Daniel 10:6</a>. The eyes of the Lord, which are in every place, beholding the evil and the good, are here described as like unto fire, to express not merely indignation (He had looked once on the Jewish rulers in indignation) against evil, but determination to consume it; for our God is a consuming fire, purging away sin from those who forsake sin, and consuming in their sin those who refuse to be separated from it. (See <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title="Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.">Jude 1:7</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His head</span>. From the garments of the great High Priest, St. John passes on to himself. What he had seen as a momentary foretaste of glory at the Transfiguration, he sees now as the abiding condition of the Christ. In <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a> "the Ancient of days" has "the hair of his head like pure wool." This snowy whiteness is partly the brightness of heavenly glory, partly the majesty of the hoary head. The Christ appears to St. John as a son of man, but also as a "Divine Person invested with the attributes of eternity." <span class="cmt_word">As a flame of fire</span>. "The Lord thy God is a consuming fire" (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). "I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).
