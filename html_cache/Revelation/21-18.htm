In biblical times, jasper was highly valued and used in various forms of decoration and jewelry. Its mention here symbolizes the glory and majesty of the New Jerusalem. Jasper is also referenced in <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>, where it describes the appearance of God on His throne, indicating purity and divine presence. The wall being made of jasper signifies the protection and eternal security of the city, reflecting God's unchanging nature and His covenant with His people.<p><b>and the city itself of pure gold</b><br>Gold is a symbol of purity, value, and royalty throughout the Bible. In the ancient world, gold was the most precious metal, often used in the construction of temples and palaces. The use of pure gold to describe the city emphasizes its divine origin and the perfection of God's creation. This imagery connects to the Old Testament, where the tabernacle and Solomon's temple were adorned with gold, signifying God's dwelling place among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). The city being made of pure gold highlights the holiness and splendor of the New Jerusalem, a place where God's presence is fully realized.<p><b>as pure as glass</b><br>The phrase "as pure as glass" suggests transparency and clarity, qualities that are often associated with truth and righteousness. In the ancient world, glass was not as refined as it is today, making pure, clear glass a rare and valuable commodity. This description implies that the city is free from impurity and corruption, reflecting the perfect and unblemished nature of God's kingdom. The transparency also symbolizes the openness and accessibility of God's presence, where nothing is hidden, and all is revealed in His light. This imagery aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, where Paul speaks of seeing "face to face" and knowing fully, as we are fully known.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_jerusalem.htm">The New Jerusalem</a></b><br>This is the holy city described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, representing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people.
