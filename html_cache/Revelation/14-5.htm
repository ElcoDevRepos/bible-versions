In biblical context, truthfulness is a key characteristic of God's people, contrasting with the deceitfulness of Satan, who is described as the "father of lies" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The absence of deceit in their speech signifies their complete devotion and alignment with God's truth. This echoes the call for integrity found in <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, where the righteous are described as those who "speak the truth from their heart." The imagery of a lie-free mouth also connects to the prophetic vision of a restored Israel, where deceit is absent (<a href="/zephaniah/3-13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>).<p><b>they are blameless.</b><br>The term "blameless" is often used in Scripture to describe those who are righteous and upright before God. In the Old Testament, figures like Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>) and Job (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>) are described as blameless, indicating their faithfulness and moral integrity. In the New Testament, believers are called to be blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation" (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). This blamelessness is not about sinless perfection but rather a state of being justified and sanctified through Christ. The 144,000's blamelessness signifies their complete redemption and sanctification, reflecting the holiness required to stand before God. This aligns with the eschatological hope of believers being presented blameless before the presence of God's glory (<a href="/jude/1-24.htm">Jude 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_144,000.htm">The 144,000</a></b><br>This group is mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>.
