It echoes the words of Jesus in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a> and <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His teachings. The "ear" symbolizes the capacity to receive spiritual truth, suggesting that not everyone is willing or able to comprehend divine messages.<p><b>let him hear</b><br>This is an imperative command, stressing the necessity of not just hearing but truly understanding and internalizing the message. In the biblical context, hearing implies obedience and action. This phrase underscores the responsibility of the listener to respond to the divine revelation being given.<p><b>what the Spirit says</b><br>The Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, who communicates God's will and truth to believers. In the context of Revelation, the Spirit is the source of prophetic insight and guidance. This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in conveying messages from God, as seen throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, where the Spirit is described as guiding believers into all truth.<p><b>to the churches</b><br>The message is directed to the seven churches in Asia Minor, as mentioned earlier in Revelation chapters 2 and 3. These churches represent not only specific historical congregations but also symbolize the universal church throughout the ages. The plural "churches" indicates that the message is applicable to all Christian communities, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the church to heed the Spirit's guidance. This reflects the communal nature of the early Christian faith and the shared challenges and promises faced by believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's messages to the churches.

The seven messages were not merely separate admonitions addressed only to each particular Church, but all the epistles were meant for all the seven Churches, and, after them, for the universal Church. Each Church had an especial failing brought more emphatically before it; but still the seven warnings are one whole, for the edification of all. As it behoves the individual Christian to avoid and repent of all sin, and yet to fix his attention on the cure of some besetting sin to which he is peculiarly liable, so these messages, though intended to be read by all, and heeded by all, place vividly before each Church its besetting sin, which more particularly requires attention. And as the sins to be avoided are to be avoided by all, so the separate rewards arc promised to all who overcome. They are, therefore, not really distinct rewards, but rather different phases and views of one great whole, which shall be enjoyed in its entirety by those who have struggled victoriously with the trials and temptations of the world. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
