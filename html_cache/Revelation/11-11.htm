This timeframe echoes the three and a half years (1,260 days) mentioned earlier in Revelation, which is associated with the period of tribulation. It also parallels the three and a half years of drought during Elijah's time (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>) and the time, times, and half a time in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, suggesting a period of divine testing or judgment.<p><b>the breath of life from God entered the two witnesses</b><br>The "breath of life" is reminiscent of the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. This indicates a divine act of resurrection and restoration, emphasizing God's power over life and death. The two witnesses are often seen as representatives of the law and the prophets, or the church's testimony, and their revival signifies the triumph of God's word and testimony over evil.<p><b>and they stood on their feet</b><br>This phrase signifies resurrection and vindication. Standing on their feet indicates a return to life and strength, similar to the vision of the dry bones in <a href="/ezekiel/37-10.htm">Ezekiel 37:10</a>, where the breath of God brings life to the slain. It symbolizes the ultimate victory of God's witnesses over their enemies and the validation of their testimony.<p><b>and great fear fell upon those who saw them</b><br>The reaction of fear among the observers highlights the undeniable power and authority of God. This fear is not just terror but a recognition of divine intervention and judgment. It parallels the fear that fell upon the guards at Jesus' tomb (<a href="/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a>) and the awe experienced by those who witnessed miraculous events throughout the Bible. This fear serves as a precursor to the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_witnesses.htm">Two Witnesses</a></b><br>These are the central figures in <a href="/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11</a>.

There is a resurrection power in even rejected truth; the strength of it is undying. If it be of God, men cannot overthrow it. "The corn of wheat that dies brings forth much fruit." The cause that seemed dead is found to be possessed of a renewed power and life. "There is an end of resistance to the Papal rule and religion; opposers exist no more !" cried the orator of the Lateran Council in 1514; but within three years and a half the hand of Luther nailed up his theses at Wittenberg.
