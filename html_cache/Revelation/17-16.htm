This imagery is consistent with <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, where ten horns also symbolize ten kings. The beast is often interpreted as a representation of a final world empire or a coalition of nations opposing God. The vision given to John in Revelation draws heavily on Old Testament prophetic imagery, emphasizing the continuity of God's revelation.<p><b>will hate the prostitute.</b><br>The "prostitute" symbolizes Babylon, representing a corrupt and idolatrous system or city that seduces and deceives the nations. In the historical context, Babylon was a literal city known for its wealth and immorality, but in Revelation, it takes on a symbolic meaning. The hatred of the prostitute by the ten horns and the beast indicates a turning point where the political powers that once supported this corrupt system will turn against it, fulfilling God's judgment.<p><b>They will leave her desolate and naked,</b><br>This phrase signifies complete abandonment and exposure. In ancient times, to be left desolate and naked was a sign of utter disgrace and defeat. The imagery suggests that the powers that once upheld the prostitute will strip her of her wealth and influence, leaving her vulnerable and humiliated. This reflects the biblical principle that sin ultimately leads to destruction and shame (<a href="/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37-39</a>).<p><b>and they will eat her flesh</b><br>This graphic imagery indicates total consumption and destruction. In biblical terms, to "eat flesh" can symbolize complete annihilation (<a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>). The phrase underscores the thoroughness of the judgment against the prostitute, as those who once allied with her will now devour her, leaving nothing behind.<p><b>and burn her with fire.</b><br>Burning with fire is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and purification (<a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14, 21</a>:9). In the context of Revelation, it signifies the final and irrevocable destruction of the corrupt system represented by the prostitute. Fire is often used in Scripture to depict God's holy judgment, purging evil and purifying what remains (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). This act fulfills the divine justice against the forces of wickedness, aligning with the prophetic declarations of God's ultimate victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_horns.htm">The Ten Horns</a></b><br>Symbolic of ten kings or kingdoms that align with the beast.

The woman in the days of the Evangelist was Rome (<a href="/revelation/17-18.htm" title="And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.">Revelation 17:18</a>), but great and resistless as her power seemed, it was doomed; the day would come when other kingdoms would rise who would hate her for her tyranny, envy her splendour, and covet her wealth. Then the great Babylon would fall, like Jezebel of old; the painted cheek, the pencilled eyebrow, and the amorous glance have lost their fascination; those who have pandered to her vices would turn against her, and cast her out to be trampled under foot. So did the Babylon of St. John's day fall--perishing in the blood that she had spilt, or left "childless and crownless in her voiceless woe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast;</span> <span class="accented">and the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast.</span> There is no authority for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of Erasmus except the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in bestia</span>, and, of course, the description given of the beast (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, etc,).
