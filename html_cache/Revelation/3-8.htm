In the context of Revelation, the deeds of the churches are often evaluated, as seen in the letters to the other churches. This knowledge is both comforting and sobering, as it assures believers that their efforts are seen and valued by Christ, but also that nothing is hidden from Him.<p><b>Behold, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut.</b><br>The "open door" symbolizes opportunities for ministry and evangelism, as well as access to the kingdom of God. In the New Testament, Paul often refers to open doors as opportunities for spreading the Gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>). The assurance that "no one can shut" this door emphasizes God's sovereignty and the security of His promises. Historically, Philadelphia was a city on a major trade route, which could symbolize the strategic opportunity for spreading the Gospel.<p><b>I know that you have only a little strength,</b><br>This acknowledges the church's limited resources or influence, possibly due to its size or external pressures. Despite this, their faithfulness is commended. This reflects the biblical theme that God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>), and that He often uses the weak to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>yet you have kept My word</b><br>The church's adherence to Christ's teachings is highlighted here. In a time when false teachings and persecution were prevalent, maintaining doctrinal purity and obedience to Christ's commands was crucial. This echoes the call to remain faithful to the teachings of Christ and the apostles, as seen throughout the New Testament (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a>).<p><b>and have not denied My name.</b><br>Despite challenges, the church in Philadelphia remained loyal to Christ, not renouncing their faith even under pressure. This steadfastness is a key theme in Revelation, where believers are encouraged to overcome and remain faithful (<a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10, 12</a>:11). The name of Christ represents His authority and character, and not denying His name signifies allegiance to Him above all else.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the church in Philadelphia.

On the other hand, it seems clear that in ver. 1 and ver. 15 <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, "I know thy works, <span class="accented">that</span> thou," and does not introduce a fresh sentence; "I know thy works: <span class="accented">for</span> thou." Then must not <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> here? But either arrangement makes good sense, and perhaps the omission of the parenthesis makes the best sense: <span class="accented">"Because</span> thou hast little power, and hast made a good use of that little, I have given thee an opportunity of which none shall deprive thee." This seems to be the obvious meaning of the"opened door," in accordance with <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>. The Philadelphian Church, in spite of its small advantages, whether in numbers or prosperity, kept Christ's word when called upon to deny him; and for this it shall ever have the privilege of giving others an entrance into Christ's fold. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, appear to point to some definite occasion. On "keep my word," see notes on Revelation 1:3 and Revelation 2:26. The antithetic parallelism, "didst keep and didst not deny," is thoroughly in St. John's style, and is one of many instances of the Hebrew cast of his language (comp. <a href="/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3, 20</a>; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5, 18</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 10, 11, 27, 28</a>).
