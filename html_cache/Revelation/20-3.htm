The "Abyss" is often understood as a place of confinement for demonic forces, as seen in <a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> and <a href="/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9:1-11</a>. The act of throwing Satan into the Abyss signifies God's ultimate authority over evil, reflecting the victory of Christ over sin and death.<p><b>shut it, and sealed it over him</b><br>The shutting and sealing emphasize the complete and secure confinement of Satan, ensuring he cannot escape or influence the world during this period. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>, where a stone was placed over the lion's den and sealed, ensuring Daniel's safety. It underscores God's sovereign control and the certainty of His plans.<p><b>so that he could not deceive the nations</b><br>Satan's primary activity is deception, as seen in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.

This brief period allows for the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the final rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7-10</a>.

(Comp. <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>, and <a href="/matthew/27-66.htm" title="So they went, and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.">Matthew 27:66</a>.) Of the exact moment when this binding and imprisoning took place it is not needful to inquire too curiously. That which in the vision is described as the work of a moment may in the fact and fulfilment be a very gradual work; or rather, the full manifestation of its accomplishment may be only gradually made clear. To fix it therefore, to any incident (for example, as Hengstenberg is disposed to do to the coronation of Charlemagne), is to fall into the "vicious realism" against which he rightly protests. The same applies to the duration of the imprisonment; it is not to be understood literally any more than the other numbers in the book; it symbolises a lengthened period. This period is followed by the loosing again of the devil for a short time. (See Note on <a href="/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,">Revelation 20:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he threw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ebalen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_906.htm">Strong's 906: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I cast, throw, rush, (b) often, in the weaker sense: I place, put, drop.
