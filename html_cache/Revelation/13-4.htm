In biblical context, the dragon represents the devil (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>). Worshiping the dragon signifies a rejection of God and an acceptance of evil. Historically, this reflects the Roman Empire's demand for emperor worship, which was seen as a form of allegiance to Satanic power.<p><b>who had given authority to the beast</b><br>The beast is often interpreted as a representation of oppressive political systems or leaders empowered by Satan. The authority given by the dragon suggests a counterfeit power structure, mimicking God's authority given to Christ. This reflects the theme of false messiahs and deceptive powers warned about in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>.<p><b>and they worshiped the beast</b><br>This act of worship indicates a societal acceptance and reverence for the beast's power and influence. It parallels the worship of false idols in the Old Testament, such as the golden calf (Exodus 32), and highlights the human tendency to idolize worldly power.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Who is like the beast,</b><br>This rhetorical question echoes the language used to describe God in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, "Who is like You, O LORD?" It underscores the blasphemous nature of the beast's worship, as it attributes divine qualities to a created being.<p><b>and who can wage war against it?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase suggests the perceived invincibility of the beast, reflecting the fear and awe it inspires. It mirrors the biblical theme of God's ultimate sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-4</a>, where earthly powers are ultimately subject to God's authority. The question also foreshadows the eventual defeat of the beast by Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dragon.htm">The Dragon</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the dragon represents the ultimate source of evil and deception in the world.
