The tribe of Judah is often associated with leadership and kingship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where Jacob prophesies that the scepter will not depart from Judah. The sealing of 12,000 from Judah emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promises and the preservation of His people.

Despite this, Reuben is still included among the sealed, demonstrating God's grace and the restoration of those who repent. The inclusion of Reuben signifies the redemption and inclusion of all tribes, regardless of past failures. The sealing of 12,000 from Reuben underscores the theme of divine mercy and the restoration of Israel.<p><b>from the tribe of Gad 12,000</b><br>Gad was one of the tribes that settled east of the Jordan River, known for their warrior spirit (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). The tribe of Gad's inclusion among the sealed reflects the unity and strength of God's people, regardless of geographical location. The sealing of 12,000 from Gad highlights the protection and preservation of God's people in times of tribulation. This also points to the spiritual warfare that believers are engaged in, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, and the assurance of victory through God's sealing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_judah.htm">Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>Judah is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its leadership and royal lineage, including King David and Jesus Christ.

The seal marks ownership, protection, and mission in the tribulation period. By naming tribes with varied histories&#8212;royal Judah, fallen-yet-restored Reuben, and embattled Gad&#8212;God showcases faithful covenant love, impartial grace, and sure preservation of Israel. The verse assures believers that every promise stands firm: God keeps His word to the very last detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand.</span> There are various lists of the tribes in the Old Testament, no two of which present the same names in the same order. It does not seem probable that any special design underlies the selection and arrangement here. First, with regard to the selection, we observe that Dan and Ephraim are omitted, the number being completed by inserting Levi, Joseph, and Manasseh. Although Ephraim and Manasseh are sometimes inserted instead of Joseph and Levi, and sometimes omitted, there seems only one example of a list in which any one of the others is omitted, viz. that in <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, where no mention is made of Simeon. It has been thought that Simeon was purposely passed over by Moses on account of his ill conduct (see <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.) - conduct for which, unlike Levi, he afterwards made no sufficient atonement. This has led many commentators (Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, etc.) to conclude that Dan finds no place here because of the idolatrous worship of the tribe (<a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.). Many ancient writers (Bede, Andreas, etc.) account, somewhat similarly, for the omission by supposing that, in accordance with a very commonly received opinion, antichrist would arise from this tribe - an opinion probably originated by a comparison of the "serpent" of <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a> with <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>. A third group, amongst whom are Ebrard, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Grotius, referring to an ancient Jewish tradition that the tribe of Dan had become extinct, and relying on the omission of this tribe in <a href="/1_chronicles/4.htm">1 Chronicles 4-7</a>. - though Hushim (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12</a>) may be the sons of Dan (see <a href="/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23</a>) - believe that the children of Dan no longer existed, and were therefore omitted. In the insertion of the name Manasseh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Forgetting") Bengel sees an intended allusion to the omission of Dan, who is, he thinks, omitted for some mysterious reason. Ewald believes that St. John wrote <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x391;&#x39d;</span>, and that MAN., the abbreviated form of "Manasses," was substituted by error; and he appeals to manuscripts 9, 13, which, however, have "Dan" in place of "Gad." Moreover, Irenaeus, Origen, Arethas, have "Manasseh," and state plainly that Dan was omitted. It is certainly curious in connection with this conjecture that, if it were true, that is to say, if "Dan" should be read in place of "Manasseh," we should have a more intelligible order of arrangement. In that case, speaking generally, the elder sons would come first, the younger last; all the pairs of brothers are kept together (only that, in the case of the six brothers, there is a division into two lots); Judah naturally is placed first before Reuben, owing to the prominent place held by him in the Apocalypse in connection with our Lord. The order would then be - <span class="cmt_word">sons of Leah</span>.<br />Juda, Reuben Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon <span class="cmt_word">sons of Zilpah</span>.<br />Gad, Aser <span class="cmt_word">sons of Bilhah</span>.<br />Nepthalim, [Dan,] <span class="cmt_word">sons of Rachel.</span><br />Joseph, Benjamin <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand</span>. As remarked above, Judah probably precedes Reuben from the greater importance he would possess in the mind of the writer of the Apocalypse, who continually exalts Christ, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Gad</span> were <span class="cmt_word">sealed twelve thousand.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(Ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
