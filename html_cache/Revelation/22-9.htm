John has fallen into the error of attempting to worship the angel, which is a common human tendency to venerate the messenger rather than the message. This correction emphasizes the importance of directing worship solely to God. The angel's rebuke is a reminder of the first commandment, which prohibits idolatry and underscores the monotheistic foundation of Christian faith.<p><b>I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets,</b><br>Here, the angel identifies himself as a "fellow servant," placing himself on the same level as John and the prophets. This highlights the unity and equality among God's servants, whether celestial or terrestrial. The reference to "your brothers the prophets" connects John to the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament, affirming the continuity of God's revelation through His chosen messengers. It also underscores the role of prophets as servants who deliver God's message, not as objects of worship.<p><b>and with those who keep the words of this book.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience and faithfulness to the teachings and prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation. "Those who keep the words" refers to believers who adhere to the instructions and warnings given in the text. This call to obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, echoing the blessings promised to those who follow God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>.<p><b>Worship God!&#8221;</b><br>The command to "Worship God" is the central exhortation of this passage. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate purpose of all creation: to glorify God. This directive aligns with the overarching biblical narrative that calls for exclusive devotion to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a> and <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>.

In the latter case, also, there is little difference of meaning, since the "sayings of this book" are exhortations to a faithful bearing of "the testimony of Jesus;" those, therefore, "who keep" (that is, carry out) "the sayings" are those who "hold the testimony of Jesus." "The prophets" need not be restricted in meaning to either Old or New Testament prophets, but may include both. The direct inspiration of the message which St. John has to deliver is here asserted.
