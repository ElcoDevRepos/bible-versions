Throwing dust on one's head is a sign of lamentation and despair, seen in other biblical passages such as <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a> and <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>. It symbolizes the depth of sorrow and the recognition of calamity.<p><b>as they weep and mourn and cry out:</b><br>The repetition of "weep and mourn and cry out" emphasizes the intensity of the lament. This reaction is not just personal but communal, indicating a widespread impact. The lamentation is reminiscent of the mourning over fallen cities in the Old Testament, such as the lament over Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30-32</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Woe, woe to the great city,</b><br>The double "woe" signifies a pronouncement of judgment and doom. The "great city" is often interpreted as Babylon, representing a system of worldly power and corruption. This echoes the prophetic language used in <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>, where Babylon's fall is lamented.<p><b>where all who had ships on the sea were enriched by her wealth!</b><br>This highlights the city's economic influence and its role in global trade. The mention of ships and the sea suggests a maritime economy, similar to ancient cities like Tyre and Sidon. The wealth generated by this trade is a source of pride and reliance, now turned to loss.<p><b>For in a single hour she has been destroyed.&#8221;</b><br>The suddenness of the destruction underscores the swiftness of divine judgment. This echoes the theme of unexpected calamity found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where destruction comes suddenly. The phrase "single hour" emphasizes the immediacy and totality of the city's fall, serving as a warning of the transient nature of earthly power and wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_city.htm">The Great City</a></b><br>Symbolizes Babylon, representing a system of worldly wealth and corruption.

The casting of dust or earth on the head is a token of sorrow and humiliation; it bears relation to the sitting in the dust. The one upon whom the sorrow had fallen sat in the dust or ashes. The attitude expressed that he had been brought very low, even to the ground. The mourning friends who came round him cast dust on their heads to express that they shared his sorrow. Thus it is related of Job: Job sat in the ashes (<a href="/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a>); the friends who came to comfort him sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven (<a href="/revelation/18-12.htm" title="The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,">Revelation 18:12</a>).
