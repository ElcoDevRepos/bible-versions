Unlike the sealed scroll in <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a>, this scroll is open, indicating that its contents are ready to be revealed. The open scroll suggests the transparency and imminence of God's message. In biblical symbolism, scrolls often represent divine revelation or prophecy. The fact that it is "small" may imply a specific or focused message, possibly related to the events that follow in the narrative. This scroll could be seen as a continuation or further explanation of the larger scroll, emphasizing the unfolding of God's plan. The act of holding the scroll signifies authority and the readiness to deliver its message, reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>, where Ezekiel is given a scroll to eat, symbolizing the internalization of God's word.<p><b>He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.</b><br>The angel's stance, with one foot on the sea and the other on the land, symbolizes dominion and authority over the entire earth. This imagery reflects the comprehensive scope of God's sovereignty, encompassing both the chaotic, unpredictable nature of the sea and the stability of the land. In ancient times, the sea often represented chaos and danger, while the land symbolized order and security. By standing on both, the angel demonstrates control over all creation, echoing the dominion given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. This act also signifies the universality of the message contained in the scroll, indicating that it pertains to all of creation. The positioning of the feet may also allude to the promise of God's ultimate victory over evil, as seen in <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, where God places all things under His feet. This imagery reinforces the theme of divine authority and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty_angel.htm">The Mighty Angel</a></b><br>This figure is a powerful angelic being, distinct from the seven angels with trumpets.

In his hand is a &#8220;small scroll&#8221;&#8212;distinct from the larger, once-sealed scroll of <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>.<p>- The size points to a focused message, soon to be eaten by John (<a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>), rather than the full drama of the seven seals.<p>- This mirrors Ezekiel&#8217;s call: &#8220;I saw a hand reaching out to me, and in it was a scroll of a book&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>). Ezekiel had to eat that scroll before speaking (<a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>); John will do the same, showing God&#8217;s consistent pattern of commissioning prophets.<p>- The scroll is therefore God&#8217;s word&#8212;already written, already true, already authoritative&#8212;now placed directly into the servant&#8217;s hand for immediate proclamation (<a href="/revelation/10-11.htm">Revelation 10:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which lay open</b><p>- An open scroll means the content is no longer hidden. Unlike the sealed book of <a href="/bsb/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a>, this message is ready to be understood and declared.<p>- Daniel was told, &#8220;Seal the book until the time of the end&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>). Here, that restriction is lifted; God is signaling that the appointed season has arrived.<p>- Later, John hears, &#8220;Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>). The open scroll in chapter 10 pre-figures that command: nothing is to be obscured when God is unveiling judgment and redemption.<p>- Practically, the openness reassures believers that the Lord is neither vague nor enigmatic about the future. What He wants us to know, He openly publishes (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He placed his right foot on the sea</b><p>- The angel&#8217;s stance dramatizes authority. In Scripture the sea often pictures chaos and the nations (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2-3</a>). By planting his right foot there, the messenger claims dominion over everything turbulent and untamed.<p>- &#8220;You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>). The same God who calmed Galilee (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) now stakes His claim over global unrest.<p>- The right foot&#8212;biblically associated with strength and favor (cf. <a href="/matthew/25-33.htm">Matthew 25:33</a>)&#8212;underscores confidence that God&#8217;s plan cannot be overturned by the powers that rise from the deep.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his left foot on the land</b><p>- Land in prophecy commonly represents settled, organized society&#8212;kingdoms, commerce, daily life (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Placing the other foot here completes the picture: the entire created order is under divine jurisdiction.<p>- &#8220;Every place on which the sole of your foot treads I have given you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>). The angel&#8217;s stance echoes that promise on a cosmic scale.<p>- <a href="/psalms/95-5.htm">Psalm 95:5</a> unites both realms: &#8220;The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land&#8221;. With one foot on each, the angel visually proclaims that the forthcoming judgments and mercies will touch every corner of earth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a> presents a heavenly herald holding an already-open, focused message, visibly asserting God&#8217;s sovereign right over sea and land.

The book is probably <span class="accented">little</span> in comparison with that in <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>. The latter contained all God's purposes, and the seer was not permitted to read it - only part was indicated to him. This book contains only a small portion of God's methods of dealing with man, and St. John is commanded to receive the whole. The contents are indicated in ver. 11 and the following chapter. The book is <span class="accented">open</span>, as a sign that what is contained therein is to be revealed. Bede thinks the New Testament is signified by it; Wordsworth sees in it the spiritual power of Rome; Hengstenberg considers that it contains the judgment of the degenerate Church. <span class="cmt_word">And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth.</span> Thus it is indicated that the revelation which is to follow affects the whole world, and is not partial in its operation, as were the judgments set forth under the earlier trumpets. Wordsworth (following Hengstenberg) sees in the <span class="accented">earth</span> an emblem of worldly power, and in the <span class="accented">sea</span> a symbol of the agitation and turbulence of nations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He held</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
