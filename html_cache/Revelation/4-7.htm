In biblical context, the lion represents the tribe of Judah, from which Jesus descends (<a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9-10</a>). This imagery connects to Jesus as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), emphasizing His kingly authority and power. The lion's presence among the living creatures suggests a representation of divine majesty and sovereignty.<p><b>The second like a calf</b><br>The calf, or ox, symbolizes service, sacrifice, and strength. In ancient Israel, oxen were used for labor and sacrifices, highlighting themes of servitude and atonement. This imagery can be linked to Jesus as the ultimate servant and sacrificial lamb (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The calf's presence among the living creatures underscores the importance of sacrifice and service in the divine order.<p><b>The third had a face like a man</b><br>The human face represents intelligence, reason, and relationship. Humanity is made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>), and this creature's human likeness may signify the relational aspect of God's nature. It also points to Jesus' incarnation as fully human, emphasizing His empathy and connection with mankind (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). The human face among the creatures highlights the value of wisdom and relational understanding in God's creation.<p><b>The fourth was like an eagle in flight</b><br>The eagle is a symbol of swiftness, vision, and transcendence. In biblical literature, eagles are often associated with God's protection and deliverance (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). The eagle's ability to soar high above the earth signifies a heavenly perspective and divine oversight. This imagery can be connected to Jesus' ascension and His role as the exalted one who intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The eagle in flight among the creatures emphasizes the themes of divine protection and the transcendent nature of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne_room_of_heaven.htm">The Throne Room of Heaven</a></b><br>This is the setting of <a href="/bsb/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where John is given a vision of God's throne, surrounded by heavenly beings and symbols of divine authority and majesty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_living_creatures.htm">The Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are celestial beings that surround the throne of God.

Scripture often connects lions with strength, royalty, and fearless leadership. &#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a> calls Jesus &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah,&#8221; showing divine rulership. &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> pictures the righteous as &#8220;bold as a lion.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a> lists the same lion-faced cherub. Together these references remind us that all fearless power belongs to God, and these creatures ceaselessly declare it around His throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The second living creature: like a calf</b><p>Next, we read, &#8220;the second like a calf.&#8221; A calf&#8212;or ox&#8212;speaks of patient service and sacrificial labor. &#8226; <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a> repeatedly records offerings of calves and oxen at the tabernacle. &#8226; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a> says the Son of Man &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14</a> again pairs an ox-faced creature with God&#8217;s glory. Here in Revelation, the calf image underscores that God is worshiped not only for power but also for His humble, servant-hearted character, perfectly fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s atoning work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The third living creature: with a face like a man</b><p>John adds, &#8220;the third had a face like a man.&#8221; Humanity is the image-bearing part of creation (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>). This detail highlights intelligence, relationship, and moral responsibility in God&#8217;s world. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4-6</a> marvels that God crowns mankind &#8220;with glory and honor.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> tells us, &#8220;The Word became flesh,&#8221; rooting redemption in real human history. &#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a> calls Jesus the &#8220;one mediator between God and men.&#8221; The man-faced creature proclaims that God values personal fellowship and has acted within humanity to redeem human beings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The fourth living creature: like an eagle in flight</b><p>Finally, &#8220;the fourth was like an eagle in flight.&#8221; An eagle soars above storms with unmatched freedom and vision. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a> promises those who hope in the LORD &#8220;will soar on wings like eagles.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a> pictures God caring for Israel as an eagle stirs its nest. &#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> notes an eagle&#8217;s speed. This creature celebrates God&#8217;s transcendence, watchful care, and swift execution of His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John literally beholds four living creatures, each mirroring a distinct facet of God&#8217;s nature and of creation&#8217;s worship: the lion&#8217;s sovereign power, the calf&#8217;s devoted service, the man&#8217;s relational intelligence, and the eagle&#8217;s heavenly transcendence. Together they encircle the throne, declaring that every realm of life&#8212;wild and domestic, human and heavenly&#8212;exists to honor the One who sits forever on high.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And the first beast </span>(better, in each case, <span class= "ital">living being)</span> <span class= "bld">was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf </span>(comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm" title="And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.">Ezekiel 1:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>), <span class= "bld">and the third beast had a face as a man </span>(or, <span class= "ital">its countenance as of a man),</span> <span class= "bld">and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</span>--These are <span class= "ital">living beings</span>, not "beasts," as in the Authorised version. The rendering "beasts" introduces confusion of thought, and violates the laws of Apocalyptic, indeed of Bible imagery. The evil powers are described under the emblem of wild beasts; for thus brute force, and unrestrained passion, and self-will, &c., are symbolised. (See <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1-2</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm" title="And the first went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image.">Revelation 16:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/19-19.htm" title="And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.">Revelation 19:19-20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm" title="And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.">Revelation 20:10</a>.) But these "living beings" do not represent the evil element in the world. They are representative of animated nature. They are four in number--as there are four beings which hold a primacy in the world: among created beings, man; among birds, the eagle; among cattle, the ox; among untamed animals, the lion. The characteristics of these four chiefs of creation unite to make a perfect picture of the spirit of true service, which should be brave as the lion, patient as the ox, aspiring as the eagle, intelligent as man. It may here be noted that the number "four" in the Apocalypse is almost always associated with the earth. (See <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>.) We need only call to mind the four quarters, four elements, four seasons, to see its fitness. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/21-13.htm" title="On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.">Revelation 21:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.">Revelation 21:16</a>.) The living creatures are "full of eyes." This strong expression is used again in the next verse. Twice used, its meaning must be significant. The same idea is found in the later prophets of the Old Testament. The wheels of Ezekiel and their tires (<a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a>) were full of eyes. The stone of Zechariah had seven (the perfect number) eyes (<a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm" title="For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.">Zechariah 3:9</a>). The thought is emphasised again in <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>, where the Lamb is said to have seven eyes. Multiplicity of eyes may symbolise vitality and vigilance. Some have thought, inappropriately enough, that it signifies the unceasing praise of God's works. A better interpretation is given by Dr. Currey. "The power of nature is no blind force, it is employed in the service of God's providence, and all over it the stamp of reason is impressed." (See Speaker's <span class= "ital">Commentary</span> on <a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>). May we not add that the force of nature is always observant of God's will? Its myriad eyes are fixed on Him, as the eyes of a servant on his master (<a href="/psalms/123-2.htm" title="Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the LORD our God, until that he have mercy on us.">Psalm 123:2</a>); doing His commandment, hearkening unto the voice of His word (<a href="/context/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20-21</a>); the eyes too of all creation wait on God, who gives them meat in due season (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm" title="These wait all on you; that you may give them their meat in due season.">Psalm 104:27</a>, Prayer Book version)-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</span> (Upon "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), see on ver. 6.
