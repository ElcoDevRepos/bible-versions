This connects to the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where the blood of the lamb protected the Israelites. The phrase "appeared to have been slain" indicates the crucifixion of Jesus, emphasizing His sacrifice and victory over death. The Lamb's appearance as slain yet alive signifies the resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.<p><b>standing in the center of the throne</b><br>The Lamb standing in the center of the throne signifies authority and centrality in the divine plan. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the throne is a symbol of power and sovereignty. This imagery suggests that Jesus, the Lamb, shares in the divine rule and authority of God. It reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory.<p><b>encircled by the four living creatures and the elders</b><br>The four living creatures and the elders are symbolic of all creation and the redeemed, respectively. The living creatures, described in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, are reminiscent of the cherubim in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, representing God's creation and His omnipresence. The elders, often seen as representing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles, symbolize the unity of the Old and New Covenants. Their encirclement of the Lamb indicates worship and acknowledgment of His authority.<p><b>The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes</b><br>In biblical symbolism, horns represent power and authority, while the number seven signifies completeness and perfection. The seven horns indicate the fullness of the Lamb's power. The seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, suggest perfect wisdom and insight. This imagery aligns with <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, where the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth, indicating divine omniscience.<p><b>which represent the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth</b><br>The seven spirits of God are often interpreted as the Holy Spirit in His fullness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which describes the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah. The sending out into all the earth signifies the universal reach and influence of the Holy Spirit, fulfilling the promise of God's presence and guidance throughout the world. This reflects the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where the disciples are sent to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, symbolizing His sacrificial death and victory over sin.

The scene calls believers to worship and trust the One who died, rose, reigns, and sees all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And I beheld, and lo . . .</span><span class= "ital">--Better, And I saw (omit "and lo") in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb (or, a little Lamb), standing as if having been slain. </span>The position of the Lamb is described from the seer's point of view: the Lamb is not on the throne, but in the middle front of it, and so apparently between the living creatures, and in the midst of the circle formed by the twenty-four elders. The passage is most striking. The Evangelist is told of the Lion which will open the seals: he looks, and lo, it is a Lamb! yes, a little Lamb--for the word is diminutive. There is deep significance in this. When we read of the Lion, we think of power and majesty, and we are right; all power in heaven and earth is Christ's, but it is power manifested in seeming weakness. The waters of Shiloah are mightier than the Euphrates (<a href="/context/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6-8</a>); righteousness and purity, meekness and gentleness, are greater than carnal weapons (comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2Corinthians 6:6-7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a>, el al.); the Lamb mightier than the roaring lion which goeth about seeking whom he may devour (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). But it is a Lamb as if it had been slain. The wound-marks are there, butit is not dead; it is standing, for it represents Him who though He died is alive for evermore; but the signs of suffering and death are visible, for it is not the Lamb, but the suffering Lamb, which is exalted; it is not the Christ, but the Christ crucified, which is the power of God; the Christ lifted up from the earth draws all men unto Him (<a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23-24</a>); the corn of wheat which dies brings forth fruit (<a href="/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>). As such He is the worship of the Church and the world which He has redeemed.

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1Corinthians 5:7-8</a>) is not to be overlooked. From the tokens of suffering the seer passes to the tokens of strength and wisdom which he saw in the Lamb. He describes it as "having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth (or, which are being sent forth) into all the earth." The horn is the strength of the animal which carries it. It is so used in the blessing of Joseph: "His horns are like the horns of a wild bull" ("unicorns" in Authorised version); "with them shall he push the people together," &c. (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; comp. <a href="/psalms/89-24.htm" title="But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.">Psalm 89:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-14.htm" title="He also exalts the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise you the LORD.">Psalm 148:14</a>). The seven horns denote completeness or fulness of strength. The seven eyes, like the seven lamps (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>), represent the Holy Spirit in H's manifold girts of grace; but as they are described as eyes of the Lamb, they betoken His omniscience who is in heaven and yet, by His Spirit, everywhere (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>); whose eye is on all events, great and small; whose eyes behold the children of men. Note, also, that the seven spirits are ascribed to the Son as well as to the Father. (Comp. <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>.) The seven spirits are said to be "sent"; the word is from the same root as the word "apostle." There is an apostolate of the Spirit as well as an apostolate of the Church; and, if we adopt the version here which gives the present participle, this spiritual apostolate is being continually exerted; the seven spirits are in process of being sent out by Him who says to this one "Go," and he goeth; to the twelve, "Go ye into all the world," .and sends His Spirit to confer on His people grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld</span>. Again a new feature of the vision is indicated (see on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders</span>. For a description of the position of the throne and the living beings and the elders, see <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. The passage would, perhaps, be more plainly rendered, "Between the throne and the four living creatures on the one hand, and the elders on the other, stood," etc. The repetition of "in the midst" is a Hebraism (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4, 6, 7</a>, LXX.). The Lamb would thus occupy a central position, where he would be visible to all. Stood a Lamb. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is here employed, and which is constantly used throughout the Apocalypse, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>. The <span class="accented">Lamb</span> of <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. This word has therefore been brought forward as an evidence that the writer of the Gospel was not also the writer of the Apocalypse, since, when the word is applied as a title of our Lord, the term differs. But the passage <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> is a quotation from Isaiah, and the writer naturally adheres to the form found in the LXX. version in that place. But on other occasions, when he is free to employ his own diction, as in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a> and in the Apocalypse, he invariably employs the term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Some have found in the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">avalon</span>) is originally a diminutive form of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">amnos</span>), a reference to, the lowliness and meekness of our Lord; and they see a contrast in the <span class="accented">power</span> indicated by the seven horns. But such interpretations, however helpful and suggestive, are not warranted by anything in the grammar of the word; since, although no doubt originally a diminutive, the word had lost all such force in St. John's time; so much so, that the varying cases were formed from both words. As it had been Main. We are here confronted with what Stuart calls an "aesthetical difficulty." How could the Lamb, which was alive, standing, and active, exhibit any appearance which would give St. John the idea that it had been slain? Similarly, in the following verses, how could the Lamb <span class="accented">take</span> the book, or the four living beings handle harps and bowls, or the elders play on harps while also holding bowls? In the first place, it is perfectly immaterial to inquire. St. John is not giving a circumstantial narrative of certain historical facts which occurred in the material, sensible world; but he is reproducing ideas conveyed to him in some way (certainly not through the senses), which ideas are symbolical of events occurring in the natural and spiritual worlds, and of the condition of men or bodies of men. Therefore, if we can ascertain what these mental pictures are intended to portray to us, it matters not in what way the ideas were conveyed to the mind of the seer. In the second place, it must be remembered that the whole is a vision; and that although St. John says, "I saw," in point of fact none of the mental impressions which he obtained were conveyed through the senses. Just as a person relating a dream says, "I saw," when in reality his eyes had been shut and his senses asleep, so the writer here says, "I saw;" and just as in a dream we receive distinct ideas concerning an object without knowing how or why we know the particular fact, and that, too, when such qualities seem contradictory to others with which the object is invested, and yet no incongruity is apparent to us, so St. John realized that these objects possessed qualities which, in the sensible world, would have been impossible. Having seven horns. Throughout the Bible an emblem of power. Moses blessed the tribe of Joseph in the words, "His horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>). Hannah sang, "Mine horn is exalted" (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). The <span class="accented">seven</span> denotes perfection (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). The symbol, therefore, attributes to the Lamb complete power (cf. the words of Christ in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth"). <span class="cmt_word">And seven eyes.</span> The seven eyes symbolize perfect knowledge - omniscience (cf. <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, "They shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth;" and <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him"). <span class="cmt_word">Which are the seven Spirits of God.</span> "Which" refers to the <span class="accented">seven eyes</span> (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, "The seven Spirits which are before his throne;" and <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>, "He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars;" and <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>, "Seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God"). The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, with his sevenfold gifts, is indicated by these symbols of illumination. For he illuminates and makes brighter those in whom he dwells, and renders clearer to them those things outside themselves, and enables them more fully to appreciate the manifold wisdom of God.
