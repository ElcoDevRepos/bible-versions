This imagery echoes <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where a child is prophesied to be born who will have a significant role in God's plan.

This imagery is also found in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where Christ is depicted as the ultimate ruler who will establish His kingdom with justice and righteousness. The use of "iron" emphasizes the firmness and decisiveness of His rule, contrasting with the fragile and temporary nature of earthly powers.<p><b>And her child was caught up to God and to His throne</b><br>This part of the verse alludes to the ascension of Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. After His resurrection, Christ was taken up to heaven, signifying His exaltation and the completion of His earthly mission. Being "caught up to God and to His throne" indicates His divine authority and His role as the mediator between God and humanity. This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory.

The psalm looks ahead to Messiah&#8217;s global reign. <a href="/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26&#8211;27</a> promises believers participation in that rule, and <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a> shows Christ enforcing righteous judgment at His return.

The sequence assures us that God&#8217;s redemptive plan is on course, Satan cannot derail it, and the King who came once as a child will soon return as the sovereign ruler of all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And she brought forth . </span>. .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And she brought forth a man child, who is to shepherd all the nations with</span> (it is, literally, <span class= "ital">in) a rod of iron.</span> There can be no doubt that this man child is Christ. The combination of features is too distinct to admit of doubt, it is the one who will feed His flock like a shepherd (<a href="/isaiah/40-12.htm" title="Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?">Isaiah 40:12</a>), who is to have, not His own people, but all nations as His inheritance (<a href="/context/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7-9</a>), and whose rule over them is to be supreme and irresistible. But the fact that this child is Christ must not cause us to limit the meaning of the vision to the efforts of the evil one to destroy the infant Jesus; for it is also the Christ in the Church which the wicked one hates: and wherever Christ dwells in any heart by faith, and wherever the preachers of the gospel in earnest travail for their Master, seek to lift up Christ, there will the foe be found, like the fowls of the air, ready to carry away the good seed. Though the basis of the vision is in the historical fact, the power of the vision reaches over a wider area, and forcibly reminds us that as there are irreconcilable principles at work in the world, so all these, when traced to their original forms, are the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the devil.<p><span class= "bld">And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</span>--The efforts of the evil one to destroy are thwarted; the child is snatched away and placed out of the range of the dragon's power. The prince of this world might instigate Israel to take Jesus Christ and with wicked hands crucify and kill Him, but the eternal divine life of Him who had power to lay down His life and take it again, and whose years were for ever and ever, was beyond the reach of every hostile power; and after death and resurrection, Christ ascended up where He was before. But the vision is designed to assure us that, precisely because of this, so all life in Christ is beyond the power of the evil one, and that the forces hostile to good are powerless against that life which is hid with Christ in God. The Church may be as a weak, oppressed, and persecuted woman, but her faith rises up as a song from the lips of its members. "God hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." The contest is between the man child and the dragon; and those who in heart and mind ascend to where Christ is know that the contest is not one of mere ideas, but a conflict between the Christ, who is with them always, though He has ascended, and all the powers of evil, which will be smitten down by the rod of His power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron;</span> <span class="accented">a son, a male</span> - the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, renders it emphatic - <span class="accented">who is to rule</span>, as in the Revised Version; <span class="accented">to rule</span>, or <span class="accented">to govern as a shepherd</span> (cf. the verb in <a href="/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a>). This reference and <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> leave no doubt as to the identification of the man child. It is Christ who is intended. The same expression is used of him in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, where he is definitely called the "Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</span> The sentence seems plainly to refer to the ascension of Christ and his subsequent abiding in heaven, from whence he rules all nations. The seer, perhaps, wishes to indicate at once the absolute immunity of Christ from any harm proceeding from the power of the devil, whose efforts are henceforth directly aimed only at the Church of Christ. Satan still hopes to injure Christ through his members. As remarked above (see on ver. 4), what is true of the personal history of Christ is often true of his Church and of his true members. And thus some have seen in this passage a picture of the woman, the Church, bringing forth members, to devour whom is Satan's constant purpose, but who in God's good time are taken to his throne to be near himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">she gave birth</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#964;&#949;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eteken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5088.htm">Strong's 5088: </a> </span><span class="str2">A strengthened form of a primary teko tek'-o; to produce, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to a son,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(huion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5207.htm">Strong's 5207: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son, descendent.
