The act of testifying is a legal term, indicating a formal declaration. The audience is "everyone who hears," suggesting the universal relevance of the message. The "words of prophecy" refer to the entire content of the Book of Revelation, which is a prophetic vision given to John. This echoes the biblical tradition of prophecy as seen in the Old Testament, where prophets conveyed God's messages to His people. The phrase underscores the importance of listening and adhering to divine revelation.<p><b>If anyone adds to them:</b><br>This warning against adding to the words of prophecy reflects a common biblical theme of preserving the purity and integrity of God's word. Similar admonitions are found in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>, which caution against altering divine commandments. The historical context of Revelation, written during a time of persecution and false teachings, highlights the need to protect the message from distortion. This phrase serves as a safeguard against heretical interpretations and emphasizes the sufficiency of the revealed word.<p><b>God will add to him the plagues described in this book:</b><br>The consequence of adding to the prophecy is severe, involving the plagues mentioned throughout Revelation. These plagues, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (Exodus), symbolize divine judgment and are part of the apocalyptic imagery used to convey the seriousness of tampering with God's word. The plagues in Revelation include various forms of destruction and suffering, serving as a warning of the spiritual and physical consequences of disobedience.

Just as he began the book by declaring, &#8220;Grace to you and peace&#8230; from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4-5</a>), he now seals everything he has written with a solemn confirmation. The gravity matches the Old Testament pattern where God&#8217;s messengers declared, &#8220;Thus says the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). John&#8217;s &#8220;I testify&#8221; reminds us of:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-4</a>&#8212;Moses read the covenant aloud and bore witness to it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>&#8212;the same author testifies to what he has &#8220;seen and heard.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>&#8212;&#8220;These words are faithful and true.&#8221;<p>The point: Revelation is not optional or symbolic rambling; it is divinely guaranteed truth that demands our trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book</b><p>The invitation is universal: &#8220;everyone.&#8221; Whether a first-century congregation in Ephesus or a reader today, the promise and warning apply equally. Note the consistent blessing attached to hearing and keeping Revelation: &#8220;Blessed is the one who reads aloud, and those who hear and obey&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; cf. 22:7). Other Scriptures echo the same call:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>&#8212;God gathered Israel &#8220;that they may hear My words.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&#8221;<p>John labels Revelation a &#8220;prophecy,&#8221; aligning it with Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel&#8212;books that were to be heard, believed, and obeyed. The term also underscores future fulfillment; these are not abstract symbols but certain realities God will bring to pass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone adds to them</b><p>Here the focus shifts from hearing to tampering. The prohibition against addition mirrors <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2 and 12</a>:32: &#8220;Do not add to what I command you.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5-6</a> repeats, &#8220;Every word of God is flawless&#8230; Do not add to His words.&#8221; Adding may include:<p>&#8226; Tacking on new prophecies that contradict Scripture.<p>&#8226; Re-interpreting Revelation to fit human speculation while ignoring its plain meaning.<p>&#8226; Diluting uncomfortable truths&#8212;softening warnings of judgment or re-imagining the return of Christ.<p>Paul issues a similar warning in <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;If we or an angel&#8230; should preach a gospel contrary&#8230; let him be accursed.&#8221; Any alteration places a person in spiritual peril because it challenges God&#8217;s complete, sufficient revelation (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will add to him the plagues described in this book</b><p>The consequence is severe and personal. Throughout Revelation the plagues&#8212;seals, trumpets, bowls&#8212;are literal judgments (<a href="/bsb/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6&#8211;16</a>). John now applies them individually: whoever dares adjust God&#8217;s message invites the same catastrophes. Compare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-35</a>&#8212;Korah&#8217;s rebellion met swift, supernatural judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>&#8212;Uzziah added to God&#8217;s instructions and was struck with leprosy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;Harmful and grievous sores&#8221; fell on those bearing the beast&#8217;s mark.<p>The warning underscores divine justice: if one inflates Scripture, God inflates retribution. His word is inviolable; usurping His authority brings the very plagues spoken against rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18</a> stands as a courtroom oath, a universal charge, a strict prohibition, and a sobering threat. John, under the Spirit&#8217;s inspiration, certifies every prophecy in Revelation as perfect and complete. All who hear are accountable to receive it without alteration. To add human ideas, diminish its plain meaning, or reshape its promises invites the full weight of God&#8217;s revealed judgments. Scripture ends by safeguarding itself, urging readers to treasure, trust, and obey the final word God has given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18-19) <span class= "bld">I testify unto every man that heareth.</span>--Omit "For," and read, <span class= "ital">I testify to every one that hears</span> . . .

The words are a solemn protest against the spirit which handles rashly or deceitfully the word of God; which adds its own thoughts, or makes its wishes the parent of its interpretations; which dilutes the force of its warnings, or impoverishes the fulness of its promises. The right of continual access to the tree of life was the promise of <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>; this right or freedom is forfeited by those who deal falsely or faithlessly by the words of Christ here. In a minor degree, it is true that those who leave this book unstudied and unprayed over, lose much spiritual sustenance and comfort. How much more do they lose who trifle with it, ignore its spiritual teachings, and sin against the laws of that kingdom whose progress it so vividly portrays.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book</span>. Omit "for." The pronoun "I" is emphatic. Here is the solemn appendix or seal of the veracity of the book, somewhat similar to the prefatory words in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1-3</a>. This is the fulfilment of the duty laid upon St. John in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>, not an announcement of our Lord himself (cf. the wording of <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book;</span> cf. the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>, "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it" (Revised Version). "The plagues that are written in this book" are those of the seals, the trumpets, the vials, the doom of Babylon, etc.; cf. the command of St. Paul to Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>), and cf. also what is said in <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16-18</a> concerning the heretical teaching of Hymenaeus and Philetus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/22-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
