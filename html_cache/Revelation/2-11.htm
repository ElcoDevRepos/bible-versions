It echoes Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His parables (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>, <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>). It suggests that not everyone will comprehend the message, highlighting the need for spiritual insight granted by the Holy Spirit.<p><b>what the Spirit says to the churches.</b><br>The Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates divine truth and guidance. The message is directed to the churches, indicating its relevance to the collective body of believers rather than just individuals. This underscores the communal aspect of faith and the importance of the church as the body of Christ. The plural "churches" suggests that the message, while specific to the church in Smyrna, has broader implications for all congregations.<p><b>The one who overcomes</b><br>This phrase refers to believers who remain faithful despite trials and persecution. Overcoming is a recurring theme in Revelation, symbolizing victory over sin, the world, and Satan. It aligns with the promises given to those who persevere in faith, as seen in other parts of Revelation (e.g., <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). The concept of overcoming is rooted in the victory of Christ, who has overcome the world (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><b>will not be harmed by the second death.</b><br>The second death is a term used in Revelation to describe eternal separation from God, often associated with the lake of fire (<a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14, 21</a>:8). This promise assures believers of their eternal security and salvation, emphasizing the hope of resurrection and eternal life through Jesus Christ. It contrasts with the first death, which is physical, highlighting the spiritual and eternal consequences of the second death. This assurance is a source of comfort and motivation for believers facing persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's message to the churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches.htm">The Churches</a></b><br>Specifically, the church in Smyrna, but also applicable to all churches as part of the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_victorious.htm">The Victorious</a></b><br>Believers who overcome trials and remain faithful to Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_death.htm">The Second Death</a></b><br>A term used in Revelation to describe eternal separation from God, often associated with the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_the_spirit.htm">Listening to the Spirit</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of being attentive to the Holy Spirit's guidance in our lives, as He speaks truth and wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Encourage believers to remain steadfast in their faith, even amidst trials, as victory is promised to those who endure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_eternal_consequences.htm">Understanding Eternal Consequences</a></b><br>Highlight the reality of the second death and the importance of securing one's eternal destiny through faith in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_through_christ.htm">Victory through Christ</a></b><br>Remind believers that true victory is found in Jesus, who has overcome the world and offers eternal life to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_2_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 2:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_2_11_s_message_on_perseverance.htm">How does Revelation 2:11 encourage perseverance in the face of persecution today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_second_death_in_Rev_2_11.htm">What does "the second death" mean in Revelation 2:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_overcome_per_Revelation_2_11.htm">How can we ensure we "overcome" as instructed in Revelation 2:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_stress_Spirit_s_message.htm">What other scriptures emphasize the importance of listening to the Spirit's message?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Rev_2_11_on_daily_faith.htm">How can Revelation 2:11 influence our daily spiritual walk and decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_is_the_second_death_in_Rev_2_11.htm">What does "the second death" mean in Revelation 2:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_2_11_s_link_to_eternal_security.htm">How does Revelation 2:11 relate to eternal security?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_overcoming_in_Rev_2_11.htm">Why is overcoming emphasized in Revelation 2:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_the_holy_spirit_a_divine_seal.htm">Is the Holy Spirit a seal of divine promise?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_theme_of_the_second_death.htm">What is the theme of The Second Death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_in_revelation.htm">What are the key themes in the Book of Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/which_2_churches_are_in_revelation.htm">What are the two churches mentioned in Revelation?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 2:11 Mean</div><b>He who has an ear</b><p>&#8226; Jesus opens with a simple test: Do we possess the willingness to listen?

In <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a> "the second death" is almost personified, as here: "Over these the second death has no authority." The phrase is peculiar to this book (see <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a> and Revelation 21:8, where it is defined to be "the lake of fire"). The corresponding phrase, "the first death," does not occur. The one is the death of the body, to which the faithful Smyrnaeans must submit; the other is the death of the soul, from which the crown of life secures them: though they die, yet shall they live, and shall in no wise die, forever (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). This second death, or death of the soul, is absolute exclusion from God, who is the Source of eternal life. The expression, "the second death," seems to be borrowed from Jewish theological phraseology. (On the repetition of the article, "the death, the second (death)," see note on ver. 13.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
