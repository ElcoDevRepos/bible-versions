The imagery of speaking to inanimate objects like mountains and rocks is a vivid expression of hopelessness. In biblical literature, mountains often symbolize stability and permanence (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), yet here they are called upon to provide refuge, highlighting the severity of the situation. This echoes <a href="/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>, where people call on mountains to cover them, indicating a desire to escape divine judgment.<p><b>&#8220;Fall on us and hide us</b><br>The plea for the mountains and rocks to fall on them signifies a wish for death or obliteration to escape the impending judgment. This reflects the human instinct to flee from divine wrath, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a> when Adam and Eve hid from God. The desire to be hidden underscores the fear of exposure to God's holiness and judgment, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>).<p><b>from the face of the One seated on the throne,</b><br>The "One seated on the throne" refers to God, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority over creation. The throne is a symbol of divine rule and judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>. The fear of facing God&#8217;s presence is rooted in the recognition of His holiness and the realization of human sinfulness, as illustrated in <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, where no one can see God's face and live.<p><b>and from the wrath of the Lamb.</b><br>The juxtaposition of "wrath" and "Lamb" is striking, as the Lamb typically symbolizes gentleness and sacrifice, representing Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Here, the Lamb's wrath signifies the righteous judgment of Christ, who is both Savior and Judge. This duality is consistent with the portrayal of Jesus in the New Testament, where He is both the sacrificial Lamb and the reigning King (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5-6</a>). The wrath of the Lamb highlights the seriousness of rejecting Christ&#8217;s offer of salvation and the inevitable judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_seated_on_the_throne.htm">The One Seated on the Throne</a></b><br>This refers to God, the sovereign ruler of the universe, who is depicted as sitting on a throne, symbolizing His authority and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>This is a reference to Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as the Lamb in Revelation, symbolizing His role as the sacrificial Savior who takes away the sins of the world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_and_rocks.htm">Mountains and Rocks</a></b><br>These natural elements are called upon by people seeking to hide from the impending judgment, symbolizing the futility of trying to escape God's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wrath_of_the_lamb.htm">The Wrath of the Lamb</a></b><br>This phrase highlights the righteous anger and judgment of Jesus Christ against sin and rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Those who are calling out to the mountains and rocks are the unrepentant sinners who face the judgment of God and the Lamb.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_judgment.htm">The Inevitability of Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is certain and unavoidable.

The phrase pairs gentleness (&#8220;Lamb&#8221;) with righteous fury (&#8220;wrath&#8221;), underscoring that the Savior is also Judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Key truths highlighted:<p>&#8211; His wrath is personal and active, not impersonal karma (<a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Judgment is certain for those who reject His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>).<p>&#8211; Believers, however, are &#8220;saved from wrath&#8221; through Him (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows the final outpouring of wrath against unrepentant humanity (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a> pictures a future moment when the unrepentant world, shattered by God&#8217;s cosmic judgments, frantically seeks annihilation rather than repentance. Their cry to mountains and rocks exposes the futility of trusting creation over the Creator. They recoil from both the Father&#8217;s glorious presence and the Son&#8217;s righteous wrath, proving that judgment is inevitable for hearts hardened against grace. The verse calls readers to recognize Christ not only as Lamb who saves but also as Judge who reigns, prompting urgent faith and steadfast hope in Him today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face</span> (cf. <a href="/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>, "They shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us;" also <a href="/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, "Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us ") <span class="cmt_word">of him that sitteth on the throne.</span> The Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). <span class="cmt_word">And from the wrath of the Lamb.</span> The result of the wroth of the Lamb is depicted in <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>.
