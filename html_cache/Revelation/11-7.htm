Their testimony signifies the completion of their divinely appointed mission. This echoes the biblical theme of God's servants fulfilling their purpose before facing opposition, as seen with prophets like Elijah and John the Baptist. The completion of their testimony suggests divine timing and protection until their mission is fulfilled.<p><b>the beast that comes up from the Abyss</b><br>The beast is a recurring symbol in Revelation, representing evil powers and opposition to God. The Abyss, or bottomless pit, is often associated with a place of demonic origin or imprisonment (<a href="/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9:1-11</a>). This imagery connects to Daniel's visions of beasts representing empires or rulers opposing God's people (Daniel 7). The beast's emergence from the Abyss indicates a release of evil forces permitted by God for a specific purpose.<p><b>will wage war with them</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual and physical conflict between God's messengers and evil forces. The concept of spiritual warfare is prevalent throughout Scripture, with <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> emphasizing the struggle against spiritual forces of evil. The war against the witnesses symbolizes the broader battle between good and evil, reflecting the persecution faced by early Christians and the Church throughout history.<p><b>and will overpower and kill them</b><br>The temporary victory of the beast over the witnesses serves as a reminder of the apparent triumph of evil in the world. However, this is not the end of the story, as Revelation continues to reveal God's ultimate victory. The death of the witnesses parallels the death of Christ, who was also temporarily overcome by evil forces but ultimately triumphed through resurrection. This foreshadows the resurrection and vindication of the witnesses, reinforcing the theme of hope and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_witnesses.htm">The Two Witnesses</a></b><br>These are the prophetic figures who testify on behalf of God.

This apparent defeat is part of God&#8217;s larger plan to magnify His power through their resurrection and final judgment on evil.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And when . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the wild beast that goeth up out of the abyss shall make war with them</span>, <span class= "ital">and conquer them, and kill them.</span> Only when their work is done has the wild beast power over them.

Here we are told distinctly that the wild beast will have his hour of triumph; he rises out of the abyss, as the locust horde did (<a href="/context/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1-2</a>). There is, then, a beast-spirit which is in utter hostility to the Christ-spirit. We shall be able to study the features of this power in a future chapter (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>); here he is seen to be a spirit of irreconcilable antagonism to Christ. The image here is not new; Daniel made use of it (Daniel 7), though in a much more limited sense. This beast-power vanquishes the witnesses. If the witnesses are those who have taught the principles of a spiritual and social religion, the death of the witnesses following their overthrow signifies the triumph of opposing principles, the silencing of those who have withstood the growing current of evil. Men can silence, can conquer, can slay the witness for a higher, purer, nobler life. They have done so. The history of the world is often the history of the postponement of moral and social advancement for centuries through the wild outbreak of some brutal, irrational, selfish spirit. The Reformers, the best friends of the Church and of the world, have been silenced and slain, and their death has often been little more than the triumph of the ignorance and selfishness of a practical heathenism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they shall have finished their testimony.</span> This is a difficult passage. How can the Church's testimony be said to be <span class="accented">finished</span> while the earth still exists? The explanation seems to lie in the words of our Lord, "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" (<a href="/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>). Christians are forewarned that, as the ages roll on, faith will wane. Though the Church be apparently destroyed, she is not really dead, but will rise again. As our Lord, after finishing his testimony, completed his work by his death and subsequent ascension, so the time will come when the Church shall have Completed all that is necessary, by offering to the world her testimony, and shall then be so completely rejected as to appear dead. Her enemies will rejoice, but their time of rejoicing is cut short (see below). After three and a half days comes her vindication, and her enemies are struck with consternation; for it is the end, and they have no further opportunities for repentance. Thus Heugstenberg says, "They shall only be overcome when they have finished their testimony, when God has no further need for their service, when their death can produce more fruit than their life." <span class="cmt_word">The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them;</span> <span class="accented">the beast that cometh up out of the abyss.</span> The article points to <span class="accented">the</span> beast which is described elsewhere in the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>), and which is mentioned here by proleipsis. "The fourth beast," which is read in A, may have <span class="accented">been</span> suggested by <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> has "the beast which then cometh up." The <span class="accented">beast</span> is Satan, perhaps manifested in the form of the persecuting world power (see on Revelation 13:1). His nature is indicated by the use of the noun <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a wild beast," the opposite, as Wordsworth says, of <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the Lamb. The beast ascends out of the abyss for a brief reign upon the earth, and is "drunken with the blood of the saints," as described in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, but he ascends only to go into perdition (<a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>). It is well to remember that the whole vision is symbolical. The intention is to convey the idea that the Church, in her witness for God, will experience opposition from the power of Satan, which will wax more and more formidable as time goes on, and result in the apparent triumph of the forces of evil. But the triumph will be brief; it will but usher in the end and the final subjugation of the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
