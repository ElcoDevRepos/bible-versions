In biblical times, wine was often used as a metaphor for divine wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>). The imagery of drinking indicates that those who oppose God will fully partake in His judgment. The "wine of God's anger" suggests a potent and unavoidable consequence for sin, reflecting the seriousness of divine justice.<p><b>poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath</b><br>In ancient practices, wine was often diluted with water, but here it is "undiluted," emphasizing the intensity and purity of God's wrath. The "cup" is a recurring biblical symbol for God's judgment (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>). This phrase underscores the severity and completeness of the punishment awaiting those who reject God, leaving no room for mercy or mitigation.<p><b>And he will be tormented in fire and sulfur</b><br>Fire and sulfur are traditional symbols of divine judgment and destruction, often associated with hell (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>, <a href="/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>). This imagery conveys the idea of eternal punishment and suffering for the wicked. The use of "tormented" indicates ongoing, conscious suffering, aligning with the biblical portrayal of hell as a place of eternal separation from God.<p><b>in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb</b><br>This phrase highlights the public nature of the judgment. The presence of "holy angels" and "the Lamb" (a title for Jesus Christ) signifies divine authority and the fulfillment of God's justice. The Lamb's presence emphasizes that Christ, who offered salvation, is also the righteous judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>).

The passage underscores both the certainty of divine justice and the urgent need to trust the Lamb who already bore the cup of wrath for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</span> <span class="accented">he also</span>... <span class="accented">which is mingled unmixed</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> undiluted) in <span class="accented">the cup of his anger</span> (Revised Version). The warning is given to men while there is yet time; the fall of Babylon, which is prophetically spoken of as having taken place (ver. 8), being yet in the future; that is to say, at the end of the world. The language in which the retribution is couched corresponds to that in which the sin is described (see on ver. 8). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, which originally signified "to mix," gradually came to signify "to pour," from the ancient custom of mixing spices, etc., as well as water, with the wine. The Authorized Version "poured out," therefore, is a correct translation. The <span class="accented">pouring</span> is in this case not accompanied by dilution with water; that is, God's wrath will not be tempered, but the wicked will feel the full force of his anger. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> The figure which is here used to portray the punishment of the wicked is common in the Bible. <a href="/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9, 10</a>, cf. with <a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>, may supply the origin of the simile. The punishment is in <span class="accented">the presence</span> of the angels and of the Lamb; that is, probably, the purity and bliss of heaven is visible to the wicked, and the sight of it, combined with the knowledge of its in- accessibility to themselves, is part of their torment (cf. <a href="/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a>). It is part of the wrath of God described in the first part of the verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
