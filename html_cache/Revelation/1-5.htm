In the New Testament, Jesus is consistently presented as the central figure of the Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. His role as the mediator between God and humanity is foundational to Christian doctrine.<p><b>the faithful witness</b><br>Jesus is described as the "faithful witness," highlighting His role in testifying to the truth of God. This is seen in His earthly ministry, where He consistently revealed God's character and will (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). His faithfulness is also evident in His obedience to the Father, even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>the firstborn from the dead</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' resurrection, which is the first of its kind, signifying His victory over death and His preeminence in all things (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>). The term "firstborn" indicates both His priority in resurrection and His authority over all who will be raised from the dead (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>).<p><b>and the ruler of the kings of the earth</b><br>Jesus is acknowledged as sovereign over all earthly rulers, a theme that resonates throughout Revelation. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's eternal kingdom (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7-9</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>). It assures believers of Christ's ultimate authority and the eventual establishment of His kingdom on earth.<p><b>To Him who loves us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and ongoing love of Jesus for His followers. Unlike the conditional love often seen in human relationships, Christ's love is unconditional and sacrificial, as demonstrated by His willingness to die for humanity (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><b>and has released us from our sins by His blood</b><br>The release from sins through Jesus' blood refers to the atonement achieved by His sacrificial death on the cross. This act fulfills the Old Testament sacrificial system, where blood was required for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).

Selah.">Psalm 89:37</a> as the faithful witness. The coincidence of expression is remarkable: "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth; he shall stand fast as the sun before me, and as the faithful witness in heaven." The idea of testimony and witness is a favourite one with St. John, who records its use by our Lord Himself. (Comp. <a href="/john/3-32.htm" title="And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.">John 3:32</a>; <a href="/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then?

And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm" title="For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:">Revelation 22:18</a>.

This was his function - "to bear witness unto the truth" (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). The rainbow is called "the faithful witness" (<a href="/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Firstborn of the dead</span>. Christ was the first who was born to eternal life after the death which ends this life (see Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; and comp. <a href="/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>). "The ruler of this world" offered Jesus the glory of the kingdoms of the world, if he would worship him. He won a higher glory by dying to conquer him, and thus the crucified Peasant became the Lord of Roman emperors, "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." The grammar of this verse is irregular; "the faithful Witness," etc., in the nominative being in apposition with "Jesus Christ" in the genitive (comp. <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto him that loved us</span>. The true reading gives "that <span class="accented">loveth</span> us" unceasingly. The supreme act of dying for us did not exhaust his love. In what follows it is difficult to decide between "washed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) and "loosed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), both readings being very well supported; but we should certainly omit "own" before "blood."
