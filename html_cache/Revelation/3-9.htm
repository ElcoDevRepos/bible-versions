The term "synagogue of Satan" suggests a counterfeit assembly, contrasting with the true followers of God. Historically, this could refer to certain Jewish groups in the first century who opposed the early Christian church. The use of "Satan" indicates their adversarial role, as Satan means "adversary" in Hebrew. This phrase echoes the conflict between the early church and some Jewish communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> and <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>.<p><b>who claim to be Jews but are liars instead</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between ethnic identity and spiritual truth. While these individuals claim Jewish heritage, their actions and beliefs do not align with the true spiritual lineage of Abraham, which is characterized by faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>). The accusation of being "liars" underscores their false representation of God's covenant people, similar to the rebuke Jesus gave to certain Jewish leaders in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>.<p><b>I will make them come and bow down at your feet</b><br>This phrase suggests a future vindication for the faithful believers in Philadelphia. The imagery of bowing down is reminiscent of Old Testament prophecies where nations would acknowledge Israel's God (<a href="/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>). It signifies a reversal of roles, where those who persecuted the church will recognize its divine favor. This act of bowing is not necessarily one of worship but of acknowledgment and respect.<p><b>and they will know that I love you</b><br>This final phrase assures the believers of Christ's love and favor. It emphasizes the personal relationship between Christ and His followers, contrasting with the rejection by those who oppose them. The public acknowledgment of Christ's love serves as a powerful testimony to the truth of the gospel and the faithfulness of the church. This assurance is consistent with the promises found in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>, where nothing can separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue_of_satan.htm">Synagogue of Satan</a></b><br>This term refers to a group of people who claim to be Jews but are not true followers of God.

But there was a time coming (perhaps the hour of temptation spoken of in the next verse) when these faithful ones, now abused and excommunicated by the fanatical synagogue, would be courted, acknowledged--nay, their aid invoked.<p><span class= "bld">I will make them to come and worship before my feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</span>--Some see in this a hint that the power of a large-hearted party to protect the Judaisers would be derived from the influence of the Gentiles, whose presence in the Church had been a stumbling-block to the Jewish party. This may have been, and doubtless was, often the case. But the promise seems to have a higher fulfilment. The course of events would show that the so-called latitudinarian was the nearest to Christ; time would transform the suspected into the respected. The Amorites would come, and the disinherited Jephthahs would be brought to be head of Gilead. In days of such trouble their strongest opponents would become their warmest supporters. An illustration of this will occur to the mind of the reader in the marvellous support which has been given to the growth of Christianity by Jews with the tongue, with the pen, with the harp and organ. Let the names of Neander, Rossini, and Mendelssohn stand for hundreds more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold I give of the synagogue of Satan</span>. The true reading seems to be neither <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> nor <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;</span>, from the form <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, which is fairly common in classical Greek. The construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>- <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, the partitive genitive used as subject or object of a verb, is frequent in St. John's writings (<a href="/john/1-24.htm">John 1:24</a>; <a href="/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17</a>:2 John 4; comp. <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>; <a href="/john/21-10.htm">John 21:10</a>). The Church of Smyrna was encouraged with a promise that their Jewish opponents should not be victorious over them. The Philadelphian Christians are told that they shall be victorious over their Jewish opponents. As before (<a href="/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>), those who "say they are Jews, and they are not," are Jews who refuse to believe in the Messiah and reject the Gospel. The only true Jews are those who accept the Christ. They are not, but do lie. Antithetic parallelism, as in ver. 8 and <a href="/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>. I will make them to come and worship at thy feet. This would be fulfilled when the destruction of Jerusalem drove large numbers of Jews into Asia Minor. Every city which had previously had a Jewish colony would then receive a great influx of refugees. This augmented Jewish settlement at Philadelphia was to furnish some converts to the Christian Church; but, as we learn from the epistles of Ignatius, these converts tainted the Church with a stubborn form of Judaistic error. Hence the need of the warning in ver. 11. Compare "The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet" (<a href="/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). Know that I have loved thee. The "I" is emphatic: "I will cause them to recoginize that in this you received a blessing manifestly Divine." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Look at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
