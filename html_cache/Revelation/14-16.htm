In biblical imagery, clouds often symbolize the presence of God (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>). The "One seated on the cloud" is commonly interpreted as Jesus Christ, drawing from Daniel's vision of the "Son of Man" coming with the clouds of heaven. This imagery is consistent with the New Testament portrayal of Christ's return (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>).<p><b>swung His sickle over the earth</b><br>The sickle is a tool used for harvesting, symbolizing judgment and the gathering of people. In the context of Revelation, this act represents divine judgment and the separation of the righteous from the wicked. The imagery of harvest is frequently used in Scripture to denote the end times and final judgment (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>, <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>). The act of swinging the sickle indicates the initiation of this process.<p><b>and the earth was harvested</b><br>This phrase signifies the completion of the judgment process. The "harvest" is a metaphor for the gathering of souls, both for salvation and judgment. In the agricultural context of the ancient Near East, harvest time was a period of gathering and celebration, but also of separation and discernment. This dual aspect is reflected in the eschatological themes of Revelation, where the faithful are gathered to eternal life, and the unfaithful face judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_seated_on_the_cloud.htm">The One Seated on the Cloud</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as Jesus Christ, depicted in a position of authority and judgment.

<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The white cloud signals purity and divine authority; the golden crown affirms His rightful kingship (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing Jesus on the cloud, the passage reminds us that judgment belongs to Him alone (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene is literal: the risen Christ, visibly present, ready to act in history&#8217;s climactic moment (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Swung His sickle over the earth</b><p>&#8220;So the One seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth&#8230;&#8221;

With a single swing of His sickle He gathers the earth&#8217;s harvest, fulfilling centuries of prophetic promise. The verse assures us that Christ&#8217;s authority is unquestioned, His timing perfect, and His word literal and trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span> "Cast his sickle;" not the same verb as that in ver. 15, but which, nevertheless, has the same signification (cf. the use of this verb in <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25, 27</a>). There are two gatherings described in this place: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the harvest of the earth by the Son of man; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the gathering of the vintage by the angel. <p>On the whole, it seems probable that the first refers to the selection by Christ of the faithful at the end of the world, while the secured describes the ingathering of the wicked for punishment immediately afterwards. This agrees with the general tenor of the whole chapter, viz, a portrayal of the opposite fates in store for the faithful and the wicked. The description thus corresponds with the account of the end of the world given in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>, with which chapter this one has so much in common (see on the first verses of the present chapter). In <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the saints are first selected and sealed, before the wicked meet their doom. Thus, also, the judgment is described by our Lord in his parables of the wheat and the tares, and the sheep and the goats. This accounts also for the first gathering being presided over by the Son of man, while the second is conducted by an angel. The punishment in connection with the vintage seems to distinguish it from the first harvest. This also corresponds to the announcements of the former angels, who first preach the everlasting gospel, and afterwards denounce those who serve the beast (vers. 6-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [One]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
