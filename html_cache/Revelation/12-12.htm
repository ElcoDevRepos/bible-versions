The context of <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a> involves a cosmic battle where Michael and his angels defeat the dragon, symbolizing Satan. The heavens are often depicted as the dwelling place of God, angels, and the redeemed (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). The call to rejoice suggests a triumph over evil, aligning with the biblical theme of God's ultimate victory over Satan (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). This rejoicing contrasts with the impending woe on earth, highlighting the separation between the spiritual victory in heaven and the ongoing struggle on earth.<p><b>But woe to the earth and the sea;</b><br>The term "woe" is a pronouncement of judgment or distress, often used by prophets to signal impending doom (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13-29</a>). The earth and the sea represent the entirety of the created world, emphasizing that the consequences of the devil's actions will affect all of creation. This reflects the biblical understanding of the earth as a battleground for spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The sea, often seen as a symbol of chaos and evil in ancient Near Eastern thought, underscores the turmoil and danger that accompany the devil's presence (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>).<p><b>with great fury the devil has come down to you,</b><br>The devil's descent with "great fury" indicates his anger and desperation following his defeat in heaven. This mirrors the biblical narrative of Satan's fall from grace and his ongoing rebellion against God (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-17</a>). The devil's fury is a response to his limited time and his awareness of his ultimate defeat, as prophesied throughout scripture (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). This phrase highlights the intensity of spiritual warfare and the devil's relentless efforts to oppose God's purposes on earth.<p><b>knowing he has only a short time.&#8221;</b><br>The devil's awareness of his "short time" underscores the urgency and intensity of his actions. This concept of limited time is consistent with the eschatological framework of Revelation, where the end times are depicted as a period of intensified conflict before Christ's return (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>). The devil's knowledge of his impending doom is a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His ultimate victory. This phrase encourages believers to remain steadfast, knowing that the trials they face are temporary and that God's kingdom will prevail (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-10</a>; <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>The realm of God and His angels, a place of rejoicing because of the victory over the devil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth_and_sea.htm">Earth and Sea</a></b><br>Symbolic of the world and its inhabitants, who are warned of the devil's wrath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>The adversary of God and humanity, cast down to earth with great anger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_heaven.htm">Inhabitants of Heaven</a></b><br>Those who dwell in the spiritual realm, called to rejoice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/woe.htm">Woe</a></b><br>A pronouncement of distress or calamity upon the earth and sea due to the devil's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing_in_victory.htm">Rejoicing in Victory</a></b><br>Believers are called to rejoice in the victory of Christ over the devil, as the heavens do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">Awareness of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Christians must be aware of the devil's presence and his limited time, which fuels his fury.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_in_faith.htm">Urgency in Faith</a></b><br>The devil's "short time" should instill urgency in believers to live faithfully and share the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_through_christ.htm">Protection through Christ</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of putting on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ's_return.htm">Hope in Christ's Return</a></b><br>The temporary nature of the devil's reign points to the hope of Christ's ultimate return and victory.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_12_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 12:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_rejoice_despite_Satan_s_short_time.htm">How does Revelation 12:12 encourage believers to rejoice despite Satan's limited time?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_devil_s_descent_today.htm">What does "the devil has come down to you" signify for Christians today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_Revelation_12_12_wrath.htm">How can we prepare for the "great wrath" mentioned in Revelation 12:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Rev_12_12_Eph_6_12_on_warfare.htm">Connect Revelation 12:12 with Ephesians 6:12 on spiritual warfare.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_daily_rejoice.htm">How can believers practically "rejoice, O heavens" in their daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_woe_to_earth_and_sea_Rev_12_12.htm">What does "woe to the earth and the sea" signify in Revelation 12:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_12_12_and_spiritual_warfare.htm">How does Revelation 12:12 relate to the concept of spiritual warfare?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_devil_furious_in_Rev_12_12.htm">Why is the devil described as having "great fury" in Revelation 12:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'many_mansions'.htm">Who accuses the brethren before God day and night?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_satan_an_individual_being.htm">Is Satan an individual being?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_war_in_heaven.htm">What is the War in Heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_three_woes_in_revelation.htm">What are the three woes in Revelation?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 12:12 Mean</div><b>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them!</b><p>&#8226; The heavens exult because Satan&#8217;s expulsion is final, echoing the triumphant worship in <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>, &#8220;Hallelujah!

This allusion to the tabernacle where the glory of God and the mercy-seat were to be found, is not without force. The sacred imagery of the tabernacle of witness calls to mind the safe dwelling which the sanctuary of God afforded to those whose testimony was given in the wilderness of sorrow. Those who tabernacled in the secret place of the Most High could rejoice with joy unspeakable.<p><span class= "bld">Woe to</span> <span class= "bld">the inhabiters . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">Woe to the earth and the sea!</span> (the words "to the inhabiters of" are not found in the best MSS.) <span class= "ital">because the devil is gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing</span> (or, <span class= "ital">because he knoweth:</span> his knowledge that his season of power is short is the reason of his great wrath) <span class= "ital">that he hath </span>(<span class= "ital">but</span>)<span class= "ital"> a short season.</span> The painful consciousness of defeat has roused a deeper and more obstinate rage.

His season is short. He may be active, sowing tares among the wheat and animating various hostile powers, such as the wild beasts of Revelation 13; but he has only a season: there is a limit to his power and the time of his power. "A little while "was the word our Lord used to denote His time of absence (<a href="/context/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16-22</a>):" Behold, He comes quickly!" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them;</span> <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">heavens</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "that dwell," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, 26, 29, 30, 31, 98, Andreas, Vulgate, Primasius, Memphitie, Armenian.

Alford observes, "There is no sense of transitoriness in St. John's use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, rather one of repose and tranquillity (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>)." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is found in C. So in <a href="/revelation/13-6.htm">Revelation 13:6</a> the abiding place of God is called his <span class="accented">tabernacle.</span> These are the words of the writer (see on ver. 10). The cause for this rejoicing has been given in ver. 9; the devil having been cast out, those in heaven enjoy absolute immunity from all harm which he can work. <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!</span> <span class="accented">Woe for the earth and for the sea!</span> (Revised Version).

The influence of the devil works woe to the whole world - to the human inhabitants, to the animal and vegetable life of the earth which was cursed for man's sake (cf. <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time;</span> or, <span class="accented">came down</span> (aorist).

His <span class="accented">wrath</span>, kindled by his ejectment from heaven, is the greater because of the comparative shortness of his reign on earth. This "short season" is the period of the world's existence from the advent of Satan till the final judgment. It is <span class="accented">short</span> in comparison with eternity, and it is frequently thus described in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/9-28.htm">Romans 9:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). It is the "little time" of <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; the "little season" of <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan must be loosed.
