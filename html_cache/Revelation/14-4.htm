In biblical times, virginity often symbolized spiritual purity and devotion to God. The reference to not being defiled with women is symbolic, representing those who have remained spiritually pure and faithful to God, avoiding idolatry and spiritual adultery. This imagery is consistent with the Old Testament, where Israel is often depicted as a bride to God, and unfaithfulness is likened to adultery (e.g., <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>). The concept of virginity here is not necessarily literal but signifies a group wholly devoted to Christ, maintaining spiritual integrity.<p><b>They follow the Lamb wherever He goes.</b><br>Following the Lamb signifies discipleship and obedience. The Lamb is a title for Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the sacrificial offering for sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This phrase suggests a deep commitment to Christ, echoing His call to His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>). It reflects the idea of unwavering loyalty and readiness to go wherever Christ leads, reminiscent of the early apostles who left everything to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-20</a>).<p><b>They have been redeemed from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</b><br>Redemption here indicates being bought back or saved, a central theme in Christian theology, where Christ's sacrifice redeems believers from sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The term "firstfruits" is significant, as it refers to the first portion of the harvest offered to God, symbolizing the best and the beginning of a greater harvest (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>). This suggests that these individuals are the first of a larger group to be dedicated to God, indicating a special status and role in God's plan. The imagery of firstfruits also connects to the resurrection of Christ, who is described as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), highlighting the hope of resurrection and eternal life for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_144,000.htm">The 144,000</a></b><br>This group is described as those who have not been defiled with women and are virgins.

Likewise, these men are the opening installment of a larger end-time ingathering&#8212;both Israel&#8217;s national salvation (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>) and the multitude from every nation (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a> states, &#8220;He chose to give us birth&#8230;that we would be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&#8221; The 144,000 stand as living proof of God&#8217;s faithfulness, setting apart the remainder of the Tribulation harvest for His glory.<p>&#8226; Their dual dedication &#8220;to God and to the Lamb&#8221; affirms the deity of Christ and mirrors His own designation as &#8220;the Firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a> presents 144,000 literal, male, Jewish virgins preserved during the Tribulation. Their sexual purity highlights undiluted devotion, their unwavering obedience demonstrates authentic discipleship, and their status as redeemed firstfruits guarantees a coming harvest of souls. Altogether, the verse showcases God&#8217;s power to keep a holy remnant, the Lamb&#8217;s authority to lead them, and the certain fulfillment of His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4, 5) <span class= "bld">These are they . . .</span>--The characteristics of the servants of the Lamb are given in this verse and the following. The first is <span class= "ital">purity</span>: they are virgins. The expression can hardly be limited to the unmarried, as the 144,000 represent the wide society of the choice ones of God. They are those whose hearts have been made as the hearts of little children (<a href="/context/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1-4</a>), who have that purity of heart which Christ declared to be blessed, and which St. James declared to be the first mark of heavenly wisdom (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, and <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>). The next is <span class= "ital">implicit obedience:</span> they follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. Some, indeed, take this to be a kind of heavenly reward: they shall be the nearer companions of the Lamb. But it is better to take it as describing their complete consecration to Christ. They are those who are with Christ, who have tasted the cup that their Lord tasted, and have taken up their cross and followed Him (<a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="/luke/14-27.htm" title="And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="/context/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24-26</a>). It is well to weigh these words; it is in the "wheresoever" that we may test the reality of our Christian life. Here lies the cross that Christ bids us take up. Here is the echo of Christ's words, "Whosoever forsaketh not all he hath cannot be My disciple." The third mark is <span class= "ital">separation, </span>or unworldliness: they were purchased from among men, as a firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. They were a chosen generation, a peculiar people (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>), as the Israel of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The fourth feature is <span class= "ital">utter truthfulness:</span> in their mouth no guile or no falsehood. (Comp. Psalms 14 and <a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1-2</a>.) The verse emphatically ends with "They are blameless." The words "before the throne of God" must be omitted. (Comp. <a href="/context/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14-15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; and <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.</span> There is little doubt that these words are intended in a spiritual sense. In the Old Testament the employment of the figure of adultery and fornication to denote spiritual unfaithfulness is common (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>, etc.). St. John elsewhere in the Apocalypse makes use of the same symbolism (cf. <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>," That woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;" also <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>). Similarly, also, St. John pictures the faithful Church as the bride adorned for her Husband the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). So also St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), "I espoused you as a chaste virgin to one Husband, Christ." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "virgins," is a word equally applicable to men or women. This verse, therefore, seems to describe those who are free from spiritual impurity and unfaithfulness; those who have not worshipped the beast and his image. Alford, however, thinks the words should be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</span> These words describe the great source of the bliss of the redeemed, viz. that they are continually in the presence of Christ. This is their reward for following him on earth; but the words must not be taken as referring to the earthly course of the saints (as Bengel, De Wette, Hengstenberg, and others). <span class="cmt_word">These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">these were purchased from among men, the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</span> Some have erroneously concluded that a reference is made to a portion of the redeemed to whom special honour is conceded; or to some who attain to glory before the rest. <span class="accented">The firstfruits</span> were the best of their kind (<a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), selected from the rest, and consecrated to the service of God. So the redeemed are the best of their kind; they who have proved themselves faithful to God, who voluntarily separated themselves from the world, and consecrated themselves to the service of God while in the world, and who are thus afterwards separated by him and consecrated to his service forever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eisin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
