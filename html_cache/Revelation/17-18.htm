In the context of Revelation, she is often associated with Babylon, a symbol of worldly power and corruption.

Historically, Babylon was a literal city known for its grandeur and influence, but in Revelation, it represents a system of opposition to God.

In the first-century context, this could be seen as a reference to Rome, which held significant power over the known world. Theologically, it represents any worldly system that exerts control and leads nations away from God's purposes. This aligns with the prophetic tradition of empires being used as instruments of divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon is described as having dominion over the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolically represents a city, often interpreted as a metaphor for a corrupt system or entity that exerts influence over the world.

That this is one fulfilment of the vision need hardly be doubted. Rome was in St. John's time the foremost embodiment of the hostile forces of the world.
