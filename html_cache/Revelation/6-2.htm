In the context of Revelation, the color white is frequently associated with righteousness and divine presence. The horse itself is a symbol of power and speed, often used in ancient warfare. This vision is part of the opening of the seven seals, a series of apocalyptic events. The white horse here can be contrasted with the white horse in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, which is ridden by Christ, suggesting a possible counterfeit or precursor to Christ's ultimate victory.<p><b>and its rider held a bow</b><br>The bow is a weapon of war, indicating that the rider is prepared for battle. Unlike the sword, which is often associated with close combat, the bow allows for striking from a distance, suggesting a form of conquest that is strategic and far-reaching. In the Old Testament, the bow is sometimes associated with God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>). The absence of arrows in this description has led some to interpret this as a bloodless conquest, possibly through deception or diplomacy.<p><b>And he was given a crown</b><br>The crown signifies authority and victory. In the ancient world, crowns were awarded to victors in athletic contests and were symbols of royal power. The fact that the crown is given to the rider suggests that his authority is permitted or allowed by a higher power, possibly indicating divine allowance for his actions. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, where even those who oppose Him are used to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and he rode out to overcome and conquer</b><br>The dual purpose of overcoming and conquering suggests a mission of both subjugation and victory. This phrase indicates a relentless pursuit of dominance, aligning with the theme of conquest. In the broader context of Revelation, this rider is often interpreted as representing a force or entity that initiates a period of tribulation or deception. The language echoes the prophetic literature of the Old Testament, where nations and leaders are often described as instruments of God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>). The rider's actions may foreshadow the unfolding judgments and trials that characterize the apocalyptic narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rider_on_the_white_horse.htm">The Rider on the White Horse</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a symbol of conquest or victory.

The white horse signals apparent righteousness; the bow, crown, and victories expose his real mission&#8212;global domination outside of God&#8217;s true peace. Granted authority only for a season, this figure foreshadows the Antichrist, launching the Tribulation&#8217;s cascade of judgments exactly as Jesus foretold. For believers, the scene affirms Christ&#8217;s sovereign control: every seal is opened by the Lamb, every crown ultimately returned to Him, and every conquest serves His redemptive plan until He rides forth in final triumph (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11&#8211;16</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Conquering, and to conquer.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">conquering</span>, <span class= "ital">and that he might conquer.</span> One version has, "and he conquered." All commentators seem to be agreed that this rider represents victory. The emblems --the crown and white horse--are obviously those of victory. The crown <span class= "ital">(stephanos)</span> is the crown of triumph. The horses used in Roman triumphs were white. On the white horse of triumph the crowned rider goes forth conquering, and that he might conquer. But who or what is here represented? Some take it to be a mere emblem of conquest, or victory, as the next rider represents war. There is then a harmony of interpretation: the horsemen reveal to the seer that the after-history will be marked by conquests, wars, famines, pestilences. The description, however, seems to demand something more: the expression, "that he might conquer," carries our thoughts beyond a mere transient conqueror. The vision, moreover, was surely designed to convey an assured happy feeling to the mind of the seer. No picture of mere Roman conquests or world-victory would have conveyed this. Is not the vision the reflex of the hopes of early Christian thought? It is the symbol of Christian victory. It was thus their hopes saw Christ: though ascended He went forth in spiritual power conquering. They were right in their faith, and wrong in their expectation. Right in their faith: He went forth conquering, and He would conquer. Wrong in their expectation: the visions of war, famine, death must intervene. It was through these that the conqueror would be proved more than conqueror. It is, perhaps, significant of this intervening period of trouble and suffering that the rider is armed with a <span class= "ital">bow.</span> The arrows of His judgments (war, famine) would be sharp among those who refused the sword of His word. For those who will not turn He hath bent His bow and made it ready. His arrows are ordained against the persecutors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> The usual introduction to a new vision, or a special feature of a vision (see on Revelation 4:1). <span class="cmt_word">And behold a white horse.</span> The whole vision appears to be founded on that of <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-12</a>. <span class="accented">White</span> is always typical in the Revelation of heavenly things (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, "His hairs were white;" <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>, "a white stone;" <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, and Revelation 7:9, 13, "white garments;" <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, "white cloud;" <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11, 14</a>, "white horses;" <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>, "white throne"), and indeed in the whole of the New Testament (cf. <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>; <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>), the only exceptions being <a href="/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a> and <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. The <span class="accented">horse</span>, throughout the Old Testament, is emblematic of war. Among the Romans a <span class="accented">white horse</span> was the symbol of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him.</span> On a consideration of the whole of the visions attending the opening of the seals, it seems best to interpret this vision as a symbolic representation of the abstract idea of the Church as a victorious body. In a similar way the following appearances are typical of war, famine, and death. Some interpret the rider to mean Christ himself a sense not materially different from that given above, since by the victory of Christ the Church collectively and Christians individually are enabled to triumph; and in his body, the Church, Christ triumphs. This appearance is repeated, with additions, at <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>. The revelation thus begins and closes with an assurance of victory. God's end is attained in a mysterious way. Many trials and afflictions are to trouble the earth, but through all God is working to bring his Church triumphantly through the struggle. And what is true of the Church as a whole is true of each individual soul. Those to whom St. John wrote could not understand, as many now do not understand, for what purpose God permitted them to suffer. For such St. John's message is intended to be a support; not, indeed, by removing present troubles, but by declaring the final victory of those who endure to the end. Thus, then, as a preparation for the woes to be revealed, and as an encouragement after disclosing the prospect of prolonged trial, the vision of the Church triumphant is vouchsafed, both at the beginning and the end of the Revelation. Bisping and others understand the vision ass personification of war; Bengel and Reuss consider that it means conquest, or a particular conqueror (Vespasian and Trajan being denominated), just as in <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> and Jeremiah 32:36 the King of Babylon is connected with war, famine, and pestilence. Elliott, with others, interpret the rider as meaning the Roman empire, just as the ram (<a href="/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>) signified the Persian, and the goat (<a href="/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a>) the Grecian empires. Todd sees in this appearance a particular aspect of Christ's second coming. Victorinus, following <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> in his exposition of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> the Word of the Lord, which is like an arrow (cf. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Andreas sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> a vision of the Church's triumph over Satan in apostolic times; and similarly, in the second, the martyrdom of Christians in the age immediately following. Bode believes the <span class="accented">seals</span> to foreshadow the future history of the Church. Wordsworth, after St. Augustine, expounds the first <span class="accented">seal</span> as the advent of Christ and the Gospel, and the following ones as depicting subsequent troubles of the Church, which are specified. <span class="cmt_word">Had a bow.</span> The <span class="accented">bow</span> and arrows are used as signs of power by Old Testament writers. In <a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a> we have, "When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim;" in <a href="/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8, 9</a>, "Thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation; thy bow was made quite naked;" in <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, "Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies." The general idea of the vision is perhaps taken from <a href="/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7-12</a> and 6. <span class="cmt_word">And a crown was given unto him,</span> In <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, quoted above, we have a parallel passage, "Make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the Man whose name is The Branch." The <span class="accented">crown</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> - the crown of life, the crown of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he went forth conquering, and to conquer;</span> <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that he may conquer.</span> This is the key to the whole vision. Only of Christ and his kingdom can it be said that it is to conquer. All earthly empires are more or less temporary in character; only of Christ's kingdom shall there be no end. A strife there must be between the powers of earth and the powers of heaven; the gospel did not inaugurate a reign of earthly peace, but the end is not doubtful; Christ and his Church <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that</span> they <span class="accented">may conquer</span> finally, whatever earthly trials may intervene. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I looked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
