It echoes the Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>, where God declares the destinies of those who reject His ways. The concept of captivity was familiar to the original audience, as the Israelites had experienced exile in Babylon. This phrase serves as a reminder that God's plans are unchangeable and that He is in control of the destinies of nations and individuals. It also underscores the inevitability of divine judgment for those who oppose God's will.<p><b>if anyone is to die by the sword, by the sword he must be killed.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the principle of retributive justice, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. It aligns with the idea found in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes the principle of justice for murder. The sword symbolizes warfare and judgment, and this phrase suggests that those who live by violence will ultimately face violence themselves. It serves as a warning to those who perpetuate violence and persecution, particularly against God's people, that they will face divine retribution.<p><b>Here is a call for the perseverance and faith of the saints.</b><br>This concluding phrase is an exhortation to believers to remain steadfast in their faith despite persecution and trials. The early Christian community faced significant opposition, and this call to perseverance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a> and <a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3-4</a>. The saints are encouraged to trust in God's ultimate justice and to endure suffering with the assurance of their future vindication.

But is not this a warning to them that the way of the Church's victory lay through suffering captivity and meeting sword, and that the temptation to take the sword or seize the weapons of their foes would be fatal to their true success? The spirit of the words reminds them that their weapons are the weapons of faith and patience, of truth and righteousness; and they must accept the tribulation, as their Lord did His cross, because thus it must be. At the same time, their very doing so is a witness to their foes that "all those who take the sword will perish with the sword;" and that the sword, from which the saints do not shrink, will assuredly turn against those who use it. <span class= "ital">Here </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the enduring of these persecutions, and amid so many temptations, not seizing easy, world-like methods of saving themselves) <span class= "ital">is the endurance and faith of the saints.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints</span>. There is a twofold difficulty in this verse: first, as to the correct text; secondly, as to the meaning. There are two chief readings. Codex: A has <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">any one late captivity, into captivity he goeth</span>; which probably means, "If any one is ordained unto captivity, into captivity he goeth." The reading of the Textus Receptus looks like an attempt to amplify and make clear the above reading: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. XXX, B, C, have the reading of A, omitting the repetition of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. This omission is easily explained by homoeoteleuton, and accordingly the majority of critical editors follow Codex A. There are two passages in Jeremiah which are suggested by these words. <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a> reads, "Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity;" <a href="/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, "And deliver such as are for death, to death; and such as are for captivity, to captivity; and such as are for the sword, to the sword." <a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a> may also be referred to: "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." The verse in the text appears to contain both the meanings of the passages referred to. The first half seems to point out that there are woes foreordained for Christians which they must undergo: "He for whom captivity is appointed must be content to suffer captivity." The next part extends the meaning, adding a warning: "You Christians must suffer these things; not only not relinquishing your faith, but also not meeting three with force; remembering always your Master's saying, 'They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.'" Then the verse concludes, "Here is [the proof of] the patience and the faith of the saints." St. John has just described to his hearers the extensive nature of the power of the world (vers. 3, 7, 8); the obvious conclusion was that captivity, etc., was the lot appointed for some of them. He has also told them of the war waged by the world against Christians, and now he adds the necessary caution against any attempt to defend themselves by the use of the sword. And thus not only their patience but their faith was to be tested. They were not only to bear patiently evils which they could not avoid, but they must have sufficient faith to enable them voluntarily to forego any opportunities which might occur to prevent their sufferings by force of arms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7988;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
