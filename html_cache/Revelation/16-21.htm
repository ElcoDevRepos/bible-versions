The imagery of hailstones is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>) and serves as a symbol of divine judgment. The weight of the hailstones, nearly a hundred pounds, emphasizes the severity and supernatural nature of this judgment, as such large hailstones are not naturally occurring. This event can be seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as in <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, where hail is used as an instrument of God's wrath. The use of hailstones also connects to the theme of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22-23</a>, where God stores up hail for times of trouble.<p><b>And men cursed God for the plague of hail, because it was so horrendous.</b><br>Despite the clear demonstration of divine power, the response of the people is one of blasphemy rather than repentance. This reaction highlights the hardness of human hearts and the persistent rebellion against God, even in the face of undeniable evidence of His might. This mirrors the response of Pharaoh during the plagues of Egypt, where his heart was hardened despite witnessing God's power (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34-35</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of judgment throughout Revelation, where humanity's refusal to repent leads to further divine retribution. It also serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_hailstones.htm">Great Hailstones</a></b><br>These are massive stones of ice, each weighing about a hundred pounds, symbolizing divine judgment and wrath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Refers to humanity experiencing the judgment, specifically those who are unrepentant and blasphemous towards God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity executing judgment upon the earth, highlighting His power and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague_of_hail.htm">Plague of Hail</a></b><br>A catastrophic event that is part of the series of judgments described in Revelation, emphasizing the severity of God's wrath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cursing_of_god.htm">Cursing of God</a></b><br>The response of the people to the judgment, showing their hardened hearts and refusal to repent.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, including natural disasters, and uses them to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_human_hearts.htm">The Hardness of Human Hearts</a></b><br>Understand that despite clear signs of divine intervention, many will still refuse to repent, highlighting the depth of human rebellion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_repentance.htm">The Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Use these warnings as a call to examine our own lives and ensure we are living in alignment with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_justice.htm">The Reality of Divine Justice</a></b><br>Acknowledge that God's justice is real and will be executed, encouraging believers to live righteously and share the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_protection.htm">Hope in God's Protection</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to protect and preserve His people even amidst severe judgments.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_16_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 16:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_21_God_s_judgment_via_hail.htm">How does Revelation 16:21 illustrate God's judgment through "hailstones weighing a talent"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_repentance_from_Rev_16_21.htm">What lessons can we learn about repentance from Revelation 16:21's depiction of judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Rev_16_21_to_OT_plagues_judgments.htm">How does Revelation 16:21 connect with Old Testament plagues and judgments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Rev_16_21_on_God_s_power_justice.htm">How should Revelation 16:21 influence our understanding of God's power and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Rev_16_21_inspire_faith_in_trials.htm">In what ways can Revelation 16:21 encourage believers to remain faithful amidst trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_21_on_God_s_wrath.htm">What does Revelation 16:21 reveal about God's judgment and wrath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_21_and_divine_justice_link.htm">How does Revelation 16:21 relate to the concept of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_hailstones_in_Rev_16_21_a_talent.htm">Why are the hailstones in Revelation 16:21 described as weighing a talent?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_seven_bowls_of_revelation.htm">What are the Seven Bowls of Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_revelation's_plagues_be_validated.htm">Revelation 15:1 mentions seven last plagues&#8212;how can these be scientifically or historically validated?

"Hail" is frequently mentioned as a judgment of God and is added here to heighten the general effect of the description (cf. <a href="/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>; also <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great;</span> <span class="accented">is exceeding great</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). As in ver. 9, men repent not. Like Pharaoh, their hearts are hardened. These words end the general description of the vial judgments, but the events alludes to under the seventh vial are elaborated and particularized in the chapters which follow; the whole concluding at the end of <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">huge</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(megal&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">Large, great, in the widest sense. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">hailstones,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#967;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(chalaza)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5464.htm">Strong's 5464: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hail.
