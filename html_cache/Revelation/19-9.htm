Angels often serve as messengers in biblical texts, conveying God's will to humans. The act of writing signifies the permanence and reliability of the revelation, ensuring it is preserved for future generations.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed are those who are invited</b><br>The term "blessed" denotes a state of divine favor and happiness. This echoes the Beatitudes in the Gospels, where blessings are pronounced on those who align with God's will.

The Lamb refers to Jesus Christ, highlighting His sacrificial role as the Passover Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).

The general and simplest opinion is that it is the angel mentioned in <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a> who speaks. The speaker bids the seer <span class= "ital">write: "</span>Blessed are they who are bidden to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb." This is one of the six benedictions of the Apocalypse (Rev. <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>): it is founded on our Lord's parables (<a href="/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>; comp. also <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>): the blessing of the call to the marriage supper is more clearly realised now that the day of joy is at hand. We must not draw too sharp distinctions, as some have done, between the bride and the guests: the imagery is varied to give fulness and force to the truths which no emblems can adequately express. The Church of Christ will rest, and feast, and reign with her Lord; and in all the peace, gladness, and triumph of that joy-time God's servants will share. A solemn confirmation of this follows, as in <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> : "these words are true (sayings) of God." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">which are bidden</span> (Revised Version). Cf. the command in <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a> and Revelation 21:5, and the prohibition in Revelation 10:4; cf. also the expression in <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "Blessed are the dead," etc. It almost seems as if the writer has in his mind the connection of ideas indicated by the words quoted above on ver. 8, "Their works do follow them." The figure of the "marriage supper" is rather a new symbol than the continuation of the symbol of the bride; though very probably suggested by it. For those who partake of the "marriage supper" are those who constitute the bride, viz. the faithful Church of God. Cf. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, the words which are spoken by the "Amen, the faithful and true Witness" (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>): "If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." It is impossible to say who the speaker is that thus addresses St. John, except in so far as may be gathered from ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.</span> Cf. the words of <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, quoted above, and <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; also the "Yea, saith the Spirit" of <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>. (On the word "true," see <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>.) These words have been restricted to different portions of the Apocalypse by different commentators; but it seems best, on the whole, to understand them as referring to the whole series of visions connected with the harlot and Babylon and the faithful bride of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/19-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the angel] told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">me</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(moi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
