It suggests a collective voice, possibly of those who have witnessed the fall of Babylon, symbolizing a great city or system opposed to God. This echoes the lamentations found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, where the fall of Tyre is mourned.<p><b>The fruit of your soul&#8217;s desire has departed from you;</b><br>The "fruit" symbolizes the results or rewards of one's pursuits and desires. In biblical terms, fruit often represents the outcomes of one's actions, whether good or bad (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). Here, it signifies the loss of what was once deeply desired, indicating a judgment on misplaced priorities. This reflects the transient nature of earthly desires, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>, where Solomon speaks of the vanity of worldly pursuits.<p><b>all your luxury and splendor have vanished,</b><br>Luxury and splendor refer to wealth, opulence, and the outward signs of prosperity. The Bible frequently warns against the dangers of wealth and the false security it provides (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>). The vanishing of these indicates a divine judgment, reminiscent of the sudden destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), serving as a warning against pride and self-indulgence.<p><b>never to be seen again.</b><br>This finality underscores the totality of the judgment. It suggests a complete and irreversible end, similar to the destruction of Babylon in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>). This phrase emphasizes the permanence of God's judgment and the futility of relying on temporal power and wealth. It also points to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where only what is eternal will remain (<a href="/hebrews/12-27.htm">Hebrews 12:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon_the_great.htm">Babylon the Great</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, corrupt system or city that embodies wealth, luxury, and moral decay.
