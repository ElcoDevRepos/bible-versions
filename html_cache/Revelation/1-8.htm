Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing that God is the beginning and the end of all things. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>, where God declares Himself as the first and the last. It emphasizes God's sovereignty over time and history, affirming His omnipresence and omnipotence. In the context of Revelation, it underscores the fulfillment of God's plan from creation to the end times.<p><b>says the Lord God,</b><br>The title "Lord God" is a declaration of divine authority and power. It connects to the Old Testament usage of "Yahweh Elohim," highlighting God's covenant relationship with His people. This phrase assures the readers of God's supreme authority and His active role in the unfolding of prophetic events. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and His ultimate control over the universe.<p><b>who is and was and is to come&#8212;</b><br>This description of God emphasizes His eternal existence and unchanging nature. It reflects the Hebrew understanding of God as the "I AM" (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>), who exists beyond the constraints of time. This phrase reassures believers of God's constant presence and His involvement in past, present, and future events. It also points to the eschatological hope of Christ's return, as God will bring His purposes to completion.<p><b>the Almighty.</b><br>The term "Almighty" (Greek: Pantokrator) denotes God's all-encompassing power and authority. It is a title used throughout Revelation to describe God's ability to execute His will and judgment. This attribute of God provides comfort and assurance to believers facing persecution, as it affirms that God is in control and will ultimately triumph over evil. The use of "Almighty" also connects to the Old Testament, where God is often referred to as "El Shaddai," highlighting His strength and sufficiency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, identified as the eternal and sovereign God, emphasizing His omnipotence and eternal nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/alpha_and_omega.htm">Alpha and Omega</a></b><br>The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing completeness and eternity.

In the simple majesty of its solemn language it reminds us of the opening of St. John's Gospel and of his First Epistle. "I am <span class="accented">the</span> Alpha and <span class="accented">the</span> Omega" is here not followed by "the Beginning and the End," which the Vulgate and some other authorities insert from <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a> and Revelation 22:13. Who is "the Lord," that utters these words? Surely the Christ, as seems clear from ver. 17; <a href="/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>. To attribute them to the Father robs the words of their special appropriateness in this context, where they form a prelude to "the Revelation <span class="accented">of Jesus Christ"</span> as God and as the Almighty "Ruler of the kings of the earth." Yet the fact that similar language is also used of the Father (<a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) shows how clearly St. John teaches that Jesus Christ is "equal to the Father as touching his Godhead." These sublime attributes are applicable to each. Like the doxology (see on ver. 6), the statement of these Divine attributes increases in fulness as the writing proceeds. Here "the Alpha and the Omega;" ver. 17 and <a href="/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>, "the First and the Last;" in <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End;" in <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." Of these four, the second and fourth certainly apply to the Son, and the third certainly to the Father, the first probably to the Son. <span class="cmt_word">The Almighty</span>. With the exception of <a href="/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>, where it occurs in a quotation, this expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) is in the New Testament peculiar to the Apocalypse, where it occurs nine times.
