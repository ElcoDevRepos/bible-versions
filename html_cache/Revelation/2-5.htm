The church in Ephesus, once vibrant in faith and love, had lost its initial fervor. The term "fallen" suggests a significant departure from their original state of grace and devotion. This echoes the warning in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>, "So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don&#8217;t fall!" It emphasizes the importance of remembering one's spiritual journey and recognizing areas of backsliding.<p><b>Repent and perform the deeds you did at first.</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in the New Testament, calling for a change of mind and heart. The Ephesians are urged to return to their initial works of love and service, reminiscent of their early days of faith. This mirrors the call to return to one's first love, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, where God remembers the devotion of Israel's youth. The deeds at first likely refer to acts of charity, evangelism, and community support, foundational to the Christian life.<p><b>But if you do not repent,</b><br>This conditional statement introduces a warning of consequences for continued disobedience. The necessity of repentance is underscored throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3</a>, "But unless you repent, you too will all perish." It highlights the urgency and non-negotiable nature of turning back to God.<p><b>I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</b><br>The lampstand symbolizes the church's presence and witness in the world, as described in <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>. The removal of the lampstand signifies the loss of the church's effectiveness and possibly its very existence. This is a severe warning, indicating that without repentance, the church would cease to be a light in the darkness. The imagery of light and lampstands is consistent with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received visions from Jesus Christ while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city to which this message is directed.

But greater changes than a decay of this kind have passed over communities in equally short periods. We have seen nations pass from imperialism to republicanism, from the fever-heat of radicalism to the lethargy of conservatism, in shorter space. Has not the past decade shown marvellously rapid movements in the Church of our own land! The change, moreover, in the Ephesian Church was not so great as the advocates of the later apocalyptic date would describe. There is at present little outward sign of decay; they have resisted evil and false teachers; they have shown toil and endurance; but the great Searcher of hearts detects the almost imperceptible symptoms of an incipient decay. He alone can tell the moment when love of truth is passing into a noisy, Pharisaic zealotism; when men are "settling down into a lower state of spiritual life than that which they once aimed at and once knew." Such a backsliding is "gentle, unmarked, unnoticed in its course." Further, it must not be forgotten that the Apostle did express his presentiments of coming danger, and specially warned the elders (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>) to take heed unto <span class= "ital">themselves;</span> and in his Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/6-24.htm" title="Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.">Ephesians 6:24</a>) he gives in his closing words the covert caution that their love to Christ should be j an incorruptible, unchanging love: "Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in <span class= "ital">incorruption"</span> ("sincerity," English version). The advice now given is, "Repent, and do the first works." The advice is three-fold: remember, repent, reform. Remember the love of the past peaceful hours. "How sweet their memory still!" "There are ever goads," says Archbishop Trench, "in the memory of a better and a nobler past, goading him who has taken up with meaner things and lower, and urging him to make what he has lost once more his own." (Comp. <a href="/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a>.) So Ulysses urges his crew to further exertions.<p>"Call to mind from whence ye sprung: . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The exhortation and threat are clear as trumpet notes: "Remember, repent, and return, or I will return and remove thee." A modern heathen philosophy teaches us that in this world to be happy is to forget. That is not the teaching of Christ. The past is both an encouragement and a warning to us; therefore "remember." Some have to remember heights from which they have fallen; others, depths from which they have been raised; others again, both. Cicero ('Ad. Att.,' 4:16) would remember the one and forget the other. <span class="accented">Non recorder unde ceciderim, sed unde resurrexerim.</span> The present imperative here shows that the remembering is to continue; on the other hand, the repentance (aor. imp.) is a thing to be done immediately, once for all. "The first works" means "the fruits of thy first love." Christ will have <span class="accented">works</span>, not feelings. <span class="cmt_word">I come to thee</span>. There is no "quickly" in the true text; and the verb is present, not future (comp. <a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>). The coming, of course, refers to a special visitation, not to the second advent. The removing of the candlestick is not the deposition of the bishop, but the dethroning of the Church, cancelling its claim to the kingdom, severing its union with Christ. Compare "The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof" (<a href="/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43</a>). The warning would seem to have been heeded at first, judging from the account of Ephesus in the Ignatian Epistles. But the Church has long since ceased to exist. Ephesus itself is a heap of ruins. <span class="cmt_word">Except thou repent.</span> This repetition drives home the charge given above; repentance is the thing absolutely necessary, and at once. This shows that what Christ has against them cannot be a mere "somewhat" (Authorized Version in ver. 4). It is nothing less than this - that with all their discernment of evil, and zeal against it, they lacked reality. Their light still burned, but in a dull, lifeless way; their service had become mechanical. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
