These elements often symbolize divine judgment and the power of God throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>, <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>).

In Revelation, earthquakes are used to mark significant events in the unfolding of God's plan (<a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12, 11</a>:13). This particular earthquake is described as unparalleled, emphasizing its role in the eschatological narrative.<p><b>the likes of which had not occurred since men were upon the earth</b><br>This hyperbolic language stresses the unprecedented nature of the event.

The phrase serves to highlight the severity and uniqueness of the judgment being described.<p><b>so mighty was the great quake</b><br>The repetition of the word "great" emphasizes the magnitude and impact of the earthquake.
