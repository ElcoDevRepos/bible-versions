This song is sung by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders, representing all of creation and the redeemed church, respectively. The concept of a new song is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a>, where it is associated with the coming of God's salvation.<p><b>Worthy are You to take the scroll and open its seals:</b><br>The worthiness of Christ is central to this passage. In the context of Revelation, the scroll represents God's ultimate plan for judgment and redemption. Only Jesus, the Lamb, is deemed worthy to execute this plan, highlighting His unique role in salvation history. This echoes the worthiness of Christ as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee bows to Him.<p><b>because You were slain:</b><br>The sacrificial death of Jesus is the foundation of His worthiness. This phrase emphasizes the atoning work of Christ on the cross, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-7</a>. The imagery of the slain Lamb is a recurring theme in Revelation, symbolizing both sacrifice and victory (<a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>).<p><b>and by Your blood You purchased for God:</b><br>The concept of being "purchased" by Christ's blood reflects the idea of redemption, akin to the Old Testament practice of redeeming a kinsman (<a href="/leviticus/25-47.htm">Leviticus 25:47-49</a>). This transaction signifies liberation from sin and death, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, where believers are described as being ransomed by the precious blood of Christ.<p><b>those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation:</b><br>This phrase underscores the universal scope of Christ's redemptive work. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The inclusion of every ethnic and linguistic group highlights the global nature of the gospel, as also seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the vision of a diverse multitude in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the sacrificial Lamb, worthy to open the scroll due to His redemptive work.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>Represents God's ultimate plan and purpose for creation, which only the Lamb is worthy to open.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_living_creatures_and_the_twenty-four_elders.htm">The Four Living Creatures and the Twenty-Four Elders</a></b><br>These heavenly beings are present in the throne room of God, offering worship and praise to the Lamb.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/every_tribe,_tongue,_people,_and_nation.htm">Every Tribe, Tongue, People, and Nation</a></b><br>Symbolizes the universal scope of Christ's redemption, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_song.htm">The New Song</a></b><br>A song of praise and worship, celebrating the redemptive work of Christ and His worthiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_worthiness_of_christ.htm">The Worthiness of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is uniquely worthy to execute God's plan because of His sacrificial death and resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel is for all people, transcending cultural, linguistic, and ethnic boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_redemption.htm">The Power of Redemption</a></b><br>Believers are purchased by the blood of Christ, signifying a profound transformation and belonging to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response.htm">Worship as a Response</a></b><br>Our response to Christ's redemptive work should be one of worship and adoration, joining the heavenly chorus in praise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_light_of_redemption.htm">Living in Light of Redemption</a></b><br>Understanding our redemption should motivate us to live lives that reflect our identity in Christ and His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_5_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_is_Christ_s_redemption_universal.htm">How does Revelation 5:9 emphasize the universality of Christ's redemptive work?

His cross makes Him worthy; His blood secures a people for the Father; His redemption spans the entire globe. Our response today mirrors that eternal song: a life of worship, confidence in His unfolding plan, and passion to see every tribe and tongue hear of the Lamb who was slain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9, 10) <span class= "bld">And they sung a new song, saying . . .--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">And they sing a new song, saying.</span> The use of the present ("sing") is another example of that intensity of interest of which the change of tense in the last verse afforded an instance. As he records his vision, he sees it anew; he describes the action as though it were even now taking place, and he still hears the notes of praise. He who knows what it is to have the strains of some rich melody haunt him for days will understand how the prophet would hear the glad chorus burst forth afresh in his ears when he recalled the vision. The new song; the chorus of the redeemed--<p>"Worthy art Thou to take the roll,<p>And to open the seals thereof;<p>For Thou wast slain,<p>And didst buy to God in Thy blood<p>Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,<p>And didst make them a kingdom and priests,<p>And they reign upon the earth."<p>The English version, "hast redeemed," and "hast made," weakens the reference to the completed character of Christ's redeeming work. It is the great victory in suffering and death which inspires the song, and makes them sing, "Thou art worthy;" and so they speak of that work of Christ as a <span class= "ital">work truly</span> done: "Thou didst buy (omit "us") out of every tribe, &c., and <span class= "ital">didst</span> make them," &c. The suffering Saviour has died, has broken the bond of the oppressor, has claimed, by right of purchase, mankind as His own; and the price was His blood. It is well to notice the harmony between this passage and the statements of other Apostles: "Ye are not your own;" "bought with a price." (See <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) Observe, also, the <span class= "ital">four</span> terms (tribe, tongue, people, nation), employed as if to give emphasis to the universality of redemption, for four is the number of extension in all directions. With this compare <a href="/context/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15-19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>. We have a right to teach all to say, "He redeemed me and all mankind." It is instructive to dwell on the climax "they reign," in contrast with "Thou wast slain." It is like an anticipation of the now familiar words-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sung a new song, saying</span>. <span class="accented">They sing</span>; the worship is unceasing. The song is <span class="accented">new</span> because it is only now, subsequent to the accomplishment of Christ's work of redemption, that the song can be sung. It is not" Thou art worthy, for thou <span class="accented">wilt redeem,"</span> but <span class="accented">"thou didst redeem."</span> Victorinus says, "It is the preaching of the Old Testament together with that of the New which enables the world to sing a new song." Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. (For a consideration of <span class="accented">the book</span>, and the opening of it, see on ver. 1.) For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood. The reason why Christ is worthy. <span class="accented">And didst redeem unto God by thy blood out of every kindred</span>, etc. Though the reading "us" is supported by various manuscripts, and similarly the first person is used in ver. 10. yet, on the whole, it seems better to omit it, the phrase being taken in a partitve sense - "Thou didst redeem unto God by thy blood <span class="accented">some</span> out of every kindred, etc., and hast made <span class="accented">them</span>, etc., and <span class="accented">they</span> shall reign." Again, "Thou didst purchase us <span class="accented">at the price of</span> thy blood" would, perhaps, give the sense more correctly; for such is the force of the words, "in thy blood" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The words point to a particular act performed at a definite time, viz. the death of Christ, by which he repurchased men from sin and Satan for the service of God; the price of the purchase being the shedding of his own blood. The words show, too, that the fruits of the redemption are intended for the whole world; not limited to any chosen nation, though some are excluded by their own act. <span class="cmt_word">Out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation</span>. This fourfold classification continually recurs in the Revelation. It includes all the bases of classification of mankind, all the circumstances which separate men, the barriers which were overthrown by the redeeming work of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they sang</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8068;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(adousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_103.htm">Strong's 103: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sing.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a new</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kain&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2537.htm">Strong's 2537: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fresh, new, unused, novel.
