In biblical literature, "woe" is often used to express lamentation or impending doom. The "great city" is commonly interpreted as Babylon, symbolizing a center of commerce, idolatry, and opposition to God. This echoes the Old Testament prophecies against ancient Babylon (Isaiah 13, <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a>) and reflects the city's ultimate downfall due to its pride and sin.<p><b>clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet,</b><br>These garments signify wealth, luxury, and royalty. In ancient times, fine linen and purple dye were expensive and often associated with nobility and the elite (<a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>, <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). Scarlet, too, was a color of opulence and was used in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>). The description highlights the city's materialism and self-indulgence, contrasting with the humble attire of Christ and His followers.<p><b>adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</b><br>The adornment with gold, precious stones, and pearls further underscores the city's immense wealth and splendor. This imagery is reminiscent of the opulence of ancient cities like Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>) and Babylon. It also contrasts with the New Jerusalem, which is described with similar imagery but represents divine glory and purity (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>). The focus on material wealth serves as a critique of the city's misplaced values and priorities, which ultimately lead to its downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_city.htm">The Great City</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Babylon, symbolizing a powerful, corrupt system or city that opposes God.
