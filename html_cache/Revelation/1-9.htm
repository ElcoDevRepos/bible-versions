This identification is significant as it connects the Revelation to the apostolic authority and eyewitness testimony of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. John is also the author of the Gospel of John and the three epistles bearing his name.<p><b>your brother and partner</b><br>John emphasizes his solidarity with the recipients of the letter, referring to himself as a "brother" and "partner." This language indicates a shared spiritual kinship and mutual participation in the Christian faith. It reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family united in Christ.<p><b>in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus</b><br>John acknowledges the shared experience of suffering ("tribulation") that believers face, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament. The "kingdom" refers to the present and future reign of Christ, which believers are part of. "Perseverance" highlights the endurance required to remain faithful amidst trials. These elements are interconnected and rooted in the believers' relationship with Jesus.<p><b>was on the island of Patmos</b><br>Patmos is a small, rocky island in the Aegean Sea, used by the Romans as a place of exile for political prisoners. John's presence there suggests he was exiled due to his Christian witness. The island's isolation provided the setting for receiving the visions recorded in Revelation.<p><b>because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus</b><br>John's exile is attributed to his proclamation of the "word of God" and his "testimony about Jesus." This indicates that his faithful witness to the gospel led to persecution, a common experience for early Christians. The phrase underscores the cost of discipleship and the commitment to proclaiming the truth of Jesus Christ, even in the face of opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the Book of Revelation.

His banishment to Patmos, far from silencing him, becomes the very setting where Jesus unveils His final word to the church. The verse encourages believers of every age to accept tribulation, await the kingdom, and persevere in loyal testimony, confident that the risen Lord turns even exile into opportunity for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">I John, who also am your brother . . .</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">I, John, your brother and fellow partner in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus,</span>. . . . <span class= "ital">because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</span> He was a fellow-sharer of tribulation with them, and he shares that patience which brings experience, because it is a patience in Jesus. It is not patience for Christ, like <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2Thessalonians 3:5</a>, nor patience of Christ, but rather patience which draws its life and energy of endurance from Him.<p><span class= "bld">Patmos.</span>--Professor Plumptre notices how little the scenery of Patmos colours the Apocalypse. "The vision that follows is all but unaffected by the external surroundings of the seer. At the farthest, we can but think of the blue waters of the Mediterranean--now purple as wine, now green as emerald, flushing and flashing in the light as the hues on the plumage of a dove." The position of the Apostle in Patmos was probably that of an exile, free to roam where he would within the limits of the island. There was at any rate no limit of chains or guard, as in the case of St. Paul (<a href="/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>; <a href="/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>). He tells us what was the cause of his exile. It was his faithfulness in proclaiming, as we know he loved to do, <span class= "ital">the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. "</span>St. John, proclaiming the Word of God, who was before all worlds, who had been made flesh and dwelt among men, who was the King of kings and Lord of lords, struck a blow at the worship as well as the polity of the Roman empire. He opposed the God-man to the man-god" (<span class= "ital">Maurice on the Revel., </span>p. 20). The contest is incessantly the same. False creeds ever aim to deify man. "Ye shall be as gods" is their motto and their bible. "Emmanuel," is the motto of the true faith--<p>"The Lord was God, and came as man; the Pope<p>Is man, and comes as God."--<span class= "ital">Harold.</span><p>The crucified, suffering Saviour, God in Christ, very God, and one with man in sorrow, was the stumbling-block in the past, and is the ideal which offends many now. (See Bp. Alexander's <span class= "ital">Bampton Lectures, </span>p. 30, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) The terms of the conflict remain unchanged through the ages. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">introductory vision.</span> This section is introductory, not merely to the epistles to the Churches, but to the whole book.

The Revised Version is again much to be preferred to the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the tribulation and kingdom and patience.</span> The order of the words is surprising; we should have expected "kingdom" to have come first or last. But "and patience" seems to be added epexegetically, to show <span class="accented">how</span> the tribulation leads to the kingdom (comp. <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2, 3, 19</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). "In your patience ye shall win your souls" (<a href="/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>). "Tribulation worketh patience" (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>); and "through many tribulations, we must enter into the kingdom of God" (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). Bengel notes that it is in tribulation that believers specially love this book. The Church of Asia, particularly after the prosperous time of Constantine, had a low opinion of the Apocalypse; while the African Church, which was more subject to persecution, highly esteemed it. "Everything tends to show that the Apocalypse was acknowledged in Africa from the earliest times as canonical Scripture" (Westcott, 'On the Canon of the New Testament,' p. 238). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the isle</span>. Here and in ver. 10 "was" is literally "came to be" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), implying that such was not his ordinary condition; comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (<a href="/2_timothy/1-17.htm">2 Timothy 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is called Patmos</span>. St. John does not assume that his readers know so insignificant a place. He does not say simply "in Patmos," as St. Luke says "to Rhodes" or "to Cyprus," but "in <span class="accented">the isle</span> that is <span class="accented">called</span> Patmos." Now <span class="accented">Patmo</span> or <span class="accented">Patino</span>, but in the Middle Ages <span class="accented">Palmosa.</span> Its small size and rugged character made it a suitable place for penal transportation. Banishment to a small island (<span class="accented">deportatio in insulam</span> or <span class="accented">insulae vinculum</span>) was common. "Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum" (Juv., 1:73). Compare the cases of Agrippa Postumus (Tac., 'Ann.,' 1:3) and of Julia (4:71). For a full account of the island, see Gudrin's 'Description de File de Patmos,' Paris: 1856. For the circumstances of St. John's banishment, see Introduction. It was in exile that Jacob saw God at Bethel; in exile that Moses saw God at the burning bush; in exile that Elijah heard the "still small voice;" in exile that Ezekiel saw "the likeness of the glory of the Lord" by the river Chebar; in exile that Daniel saw "the Ancient of days." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus</span>. No doubt the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">might</span> mean that he was in Patmos for the sake of <span class="accented">receiving</span> the word; but <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> and Revelation 20:4 are decisive against this (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>). These passages and "partaker in the tribulation" here prove that St. John's "coming to be in Patmos" was caused by <span class="accented">suffering</span> for the Word of God. <span class="accented">The testimony of Jesus.</span> This, as in ver. 2, probably means the testimony that he bore, rather than the testimony about him.
