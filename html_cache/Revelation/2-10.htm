The exhortation to "not fear" is a common biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> and <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>, where believers are reminded of God's sovereignty and presence. The context here is one of imminent suffering, a reality for early Christians who often faced hostility from both Roman authorities and local populations.<p><b>Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you,</b><br>This statement highlights the spiritual dimension of the persecution, attributing the source of their trials to the devil. It reflects the biblical understanding of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>. The mention of prison indicates a literal and severe form of persecution, common in the Roman Empire, where Christians were often imprisoned for their faith. The purpose of this testing is to refine and prove the genuineness of their faith, similar to the testing of Job.<p><b>and you will suffer tribulation for ten days.</b><br>The "ten days" is often interpreted symbolically, representing a limited period of intense trial. In biblical numerology, the number ten can signify completeness or a full measure, as seen in <a href="/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12-15</a>, where Daniel and his friends are tested for ten days. This period of tribulation serves as a reminder that while suffering is inevitable, it is also temporary and under God's control.<p><b>Be faithful even unto death,</b><br>This call to faithfulness unto death underscores the ultimate cost of discipleship. It echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a> about taking up one's cross and following Him. The early church often faced martyrdom, and this phrase serves as both a warning and an encouragement to remain steadfast, drawing strength from the example of Christ's own sacrificial death.<p><b>and I will give you the crown of life.</b><br>The "crown of life" is a promise of eternal reward for those who persevere. This imagery is consistent with other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, where crowns symbolize victory and eternal life. In the cultural context of Smyrna, a city known for its athletic games, the crown would resonate as a symbol of triumph and honor. This promise assures believers that their faithfulness, even unto death, will be rewarded with eternal life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_smyrna.htm">The Church in Smyrna</a></b><br>One of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation, located in a city known for its wealth and pagan worship.

The devil, who inspires the "synagogue of Satan," is to be allowed to afflict them, as he afflicted Job. (For "behold," see note on ver. 22.) The expression, "some of you" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is an interesting link of style between this book and the Fourth Gospel and the Second Epistle; we have a similar construction in <a href="/john/1-24.htm">John 1:24</a>; <a href="/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17</a> 2John 4.

But what is temptation on the devil's side is probation on God's side (comp. <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ten days</span>. It is unwise to make anything either mystical or rigidly literal out of the number ten, which here is probably a round number. The question is whether the round number denotes a small (<a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>) or a large number (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>; <a href="/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>). The former seems probable. It is not impossible that some analogy between their case and that of the "four children" (<a href="/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12, 15</a>) is suggested by the ten days' probation. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou faithful unto death</span>; literally, <span class="accented">become thou faithful</span>; show thyself to be such (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Note how completely the angel of the Church is identified with the Church. In this one verse we have complete mixture of the two modes of address: "<span class="accented">Thou</span> art about to suffer... some <span class="accented">of you</span>... <span class="accented">ye</span> shall have... I will give <span class="accented">thee."</span> "Unto death" does not merely mean "to thy life's end," but "even if fidelity involves death;" compare "becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross" (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The crown of life</span>. The Authorized Version, by ignoring the article ("a crown of life"), sadly detracts from the meaning. It is the well-known crown, the crown which is truly such, in contrast to earthly crowns, and perhaps with a special reference to the crowns given at Smyrna to the priests of Dionysus at the expiration of their year of office. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has been found in inscriptions at Smyrna in this connexion (comp. <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where the same phrase occurs; also <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). Excepting <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (where we have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the regular word for "crown" in the New Testament. "Of life" is the genitive of apposition; the life is the crown, just as in "the Word of life" (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>) the life is the Word. It is impossible to determine whether St. John has in his mind the crown of a king, of a victorious athlete, or of a triumphant warrior. The XII. Tables provided that he who had won a crown might have it placed on his head when his dead body was carried in the funeral procession. St. John, both at Rome and in the East, would have seen this ceremony, possibly in the case of a crowned priest at Smyrna. "The crown of life" would be the exact opposite of that. The narrative of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp draws to a close with these words: "Having by his <span class="accented">patience</span> vanquished the unjust ruler, and having thus received <span class="accented">the crown of immortality,"</span> etc. The writer seems to have had <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> in his mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;den)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3367.htm">Strong's 3367: </a> </span><span class="str2">No one, none, nothing. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">fear</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(phobou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5399.htm">Strong's 5399: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phobos; to frighten, i.e. to be alarmed; by analogy, to be in awe of, i.e. Revere.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7939;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(melleis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3195.htm">Strong's 3195: </a> </span><span class="str2">A strengthened form of melo; to intend, i.e. Be about to be, do, or suffer something.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to suffer.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(paschein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3958.htm">Strong's 3958: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am acted upon in a certain way, either good or bad; I experience ill treatment, suffer. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Look,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
