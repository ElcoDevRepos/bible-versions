The number "two hundred million" is often interpreted symbolically rather than literally, representing an innumerable multitude. In biblical numerology, large numbers often signify completeness or vastness beyond human comprehension. The imagery of mounted troops suggests a formidable and swift military force, reminiscent of ancient cavalry units known for their speed and effectiveness in battle. Historically, the use of cavalry was a significant advancement in warfare, and their mention here underscores the severity of the judgment being described. This vast army can be seen as a representation of divine judgment, echoing the locust army in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>, which also symbolizes an unstoppable force of destruction.<p><b>I heard their number.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the certainty and precision of the number, as it is not merely seen but heard by the apostle John. This auditory confirmation suggests divine revelation, ensuring the reader understands the significance and reality of the vision. In biblical literature, hearing often signifies receiving a message directly from God, as seen in the prophetic books where prophets frequently "hear" the word of the Lord. This detail underscores the authority and authenticity of the vision, as John is not relying on his own perception but on a divinely communicated truth. The emphasis on hearing also connects to the broader theme in Revelation of the importance of listening to God's message, as seen in the repeated exhortation, "He who has an ear, let him hear."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mounted_troops.htm">Mounted Troops</a></b><br>These are the vast army described in the vision given to John.
