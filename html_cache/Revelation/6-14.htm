This symbolizes a dramatic transformation or upheaval in the natural order, often associated with divine judgment. The scroll imagery suggests the revelation of hidden truths or the completion of God's plan, as scrolls were used to record important decrees and prophecies. The act of rolling up indicates the end of an era or the fulfillment of prophecy, aligning with the apocalyptic themes of Revelation.<p><b>and every mountain and island was moved from its place</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and universality of the upheaval. Mountains and islands, often seen as symbols of stability and permanence, are depicted as being displaced, indicating a profound and cataclysmic change. This echoes prophetic passages such as <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-24.htm">Jeremiah 4:24</a>, where mountains quake and hills melt in the presence of the Lord. The movement of these geographical features signifies the power of God's judgment and the impermanence of the created order in the face of divine intervention. It also foreshadows the new creation described later in Revelation, where the old order is replaced by a new heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sky.htm">The Sky</a></b><br>In this verse, the sky is described as receding like a scroll.

This is not figurative language for social upheaval; it is a literal cosmic event God has scheduled, signaling that the present order is nearing its end and His direct rule is about to be revealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a scroll being rolled up</b><p>The image of a scroll illustrates swift, visible collapse. A parchment pulled from both ends curls inward instantly; likewise, the sky will retreat at God&#8217;s command. <a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-26</a> notes that the heavens &#8220;will wear out like a garment; like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a> presents the same moment from another angle: &#8220;Earth and heaven fled from His presence, and no place was found for them.&#8221; These passages emphasize that the Creator, not chance, controls the timing and manner of this cosmic folding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every mountain moved from its place</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;every mountain&#8230;was moved from its place.&#8221; Mountains represent stability (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), yet during the sixth seal even these immovable masses shift. <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a> reports, &#8220;He shatters eternal mountains.&#8221; <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> adds, &#8220;The mountains quake before Him.&#8221; God is demonstrating that what humanity deems permanent is, in fact, subject to His sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every island moved from its place</b><p>John also sees each island displaced. <a href="/isaiah/42-15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a> foretold, &#8220;I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will make the rivers islands.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/16-20.htm">Revelation 16:20</a> revisits this future moment: &#8220;Every island fled, and the mountains could not be found.&#8221; Oceans themselves will heave; tectonic foundations realign.
