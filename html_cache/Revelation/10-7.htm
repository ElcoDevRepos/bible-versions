The "seventh angel" is part of a series of seven angels who sound trumpets, each heralding significant events in the end times. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, suggesting the culmination of God's plan. The "voice" indicates a divine announcement, emphasizing the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>when he begins to sound his trumpet</b><br>The sounding of the trumpet is a recurring motif in biblical prophecy, often associated with divine intervention and judgment. In the context of Revelation, the trumpet signifies the final stages of God's judgment upon the earth. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament traditions, such as the trumpets used in the battle of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the call to assembly or war (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>). The trumpet's sound marks a pivotal moment in the unfolding of eschatological events.<p><b>the mystery of God will be fulfilled</b><br>The "mystery of God" refers to God's redemptive plan, which has been progressively revealed throughout Scripture. In the New Testament, a "mystery" often denotes a divine truth previously hidden but now revealed (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-6</a>). This fulfillment indicates the completion of God's purposes, including the final defeat of evil and the establishment of His kingdom. It echoes the anticipation of God's ultimate victory and the restoration of creation.<p><b>just as He proclaimed to His servants the prophets</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuity of God's revelation, linking the prophecies of the Old Testament with the events described in Revelation. The prophets, such as Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel, foretold aspects of God's plan, including the coming of the Messiah and the end times. This connection affirms the reliability and consistency of God's word, as His promises and prophecies are brought to fruition. It highlights the role of the prophets as God's messengers, entrusted with revealing His divine will to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_angel.htm">Seventh Angel</a></b><br>This angel is one of the seven who sound the trumpets in the Book of Revelation, heralding significant events in the unfolding of God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_of_the_seventh_angel.htm">Voice of the Seventh Angel</a></b><br>Represents the proclamation and the execution of God's final judgments and the culmination of His divine plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mystery_of_god.htm">Mystery of God</a></b><br>Refers to God's ultimate plan and purpose, which has been partially revealed through the prophets and will be fully realized at this time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_the_prophets.htm">Servants the Prophets</a></b><br>These are the prophets of the Old and New Testaments who have been given revelations about God's plan throughout history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/days_of_the_voice.htm">Days of the Voice</a></b><br>This phrase indicates a specific period when the seventh angel's trumpet will sound, marking the fulfillment of God's mystery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_timing.htm">Understanding God's Timing</a></b><br>God's plans unfold according to His divine timeline, and believers are called to trust in His perfect timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy serves as a guide and assurance for believers, showing that God has a plan and purpose that He will fulfill.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_god.htm">The Mystery of God</a></b><br>While some aspects of God's plan remain a mystery, believers can have confidence that it will be revealed and fulfilled in God's time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_fulfillment.htm">Faith in Fulfillment</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to have faith that God's promises and prophecies will come to pass, as He has revealed to His prophets.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_expectation.htm">Living in Expectation</a></b><br>Christians are called to live with an expectation of God's ultimate fulfillment, motivating them to live holy and purposeful lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_10_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 10:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_10_7_God_s_plan_for_us.htm">How does Revelation 10:7 reveal God's plan to "be fulfilled" in our lives?

Alford points out the propriety of the expression. "When the seventh angel does sound, the completed time of the fulfilment is simultaneous with his blowing (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>), so that it is properly said that the fulfilment comes in the days when he is about to blow." <span class="cmt_word">The mystery of God should be finished;</span> <span class="accented">also</span> (or <span class="accented">then</span>, as Revised Version) <span class="accented">the mystery of God was fulfilled.</span> "The prophetic past" (Wordsworth). "The mystery of God" is all that man does not now understand in connection with God's dealings with man, but of the existence of which he is cognizant, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the existence of evil in the world, and God's modes of dealing with that and all mankind, which we only know in part. God's plans are being steadily and surely worked out, though we are not able to comprehend them. <span class="cmt_word">As he hath declared to his servants the prophets</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as he evangelized his servants the prophets</span>; <span class="accented">or</span>, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.</span> Thus <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." The promise of the complete fulfilment of the mystery of God is good news indeed for the fainting Christian, for it tells of the end of his trials and the overthrow of his enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
