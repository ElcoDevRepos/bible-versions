The opening of the seals represents the unfolding of divine judgment and revelation. The Lamb's role as the opener of the seals emphasizes His authority and sovereignty over the events of the end times, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5-7</a>.<p><b>I saw under the altar</b><br>The altar here is symbolic, drawing imagery from the Old Testament sacrificial system, particularly the altar of burnt offering in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>). In the heavenly context, it represents the place where the sacrifices of the faithful are acknowledged by God. The location "under the altar" suggests a place of honor and divine protection, indicating that the souls are precious in God's sight.<p><b>the souls of those who had been slain</b><br>This phrase refers to the martyrs who have died for their faith. Historically, Christians have faced persecution and martyrdom, beginning with the early church under Roman rule. The mention of their souls highlights the belief in the immortality of the soul and the hope of resurrection. The concept of martyrdom is deeply rooted in the Christian tradition, as seen in the accounts of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>) and other early Christian martyrs.<p><b>for the word of God</b><br>The reason for their martyrdom is their steadfast commitment to the word of God. This phrase underscores the centrality of Scripture in the life of believers and the cost of discipleship. Throughout history, many have faced persecution for upholding biblical truth, reflecting Jesus' warning in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> about the world's hatred towards His followers.<p><b>and for the testimony they had upheld</b><br>The testimony refers to their witness to the truth of the Gospel and their personal faith in Jesus Christ. This testimony is not only verbal but also demonstrated through their lives and, ultimately, their deaths. The call to bear witness is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are empowered by the Holy Spirit to be witnesses to the ends of the earth.

It is not introduced by the voice of the living beings, and the cry "Come." The voice which is now heard is not the cry of the groaning world, but of the oppressed and troubled Church. In the fourth seal the climax of world-sorrow seemed to be reached in the accumulation of war, famine, pestilence, and noisome beasts. It declared to the evangelist that there were evils which would continue and even increase in the world. "Ye shall hear of wars; nation shall rise against nation." Social troubles, war, poverty, and privation would still exist; religious troubles, evil men and seducers would wax worse and worse. Worldly policy, selfishness, and the untamed passions of mankind would still trouble humanity. Then if such troubles and disorders remain, what has the Church been doing? Where is the promise of that early vision of victory? The answer is given in the fifth seal. The Church has been following her Lord. As the vision of Bethlehem and the angel-song of "peace on earth" passed, and made way for the agony of Gethsemane, the cross of Calvary, and the cry "My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" so the glowing dream of a quick conquest over all evil passes away, and the picture of an agonising, persecuted Church takes its place, and the voice of its anguish is heard, "How long, O Lord!" The Church has her Bethlehem, her Nazareth, her Gethsemane, her Calvary, her Easter morn; for Christ said, "Where I am there shall also My servant be" (<a href="/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a>). The seals, then, are not merely visions of war, famine, &c., they are the tokens that the victory of Christ's Church must, like her Lord's, be a victory through apparent failure and certain death. The four seals proclaim her apparent failure; she has not brought peace and social and political harmony to the world. The fifth seal shows her suffering, the witness of the servants of Christ has been rejected; in the world they have tribulation (<a href="/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">I saw under the altar </span>. . .--Read, <span class= "ital">when He opened</span>, and, instead of "were slain," &c., <span class= "ital">had been slain because of the Word of God, and</span> <span class= "ital">(because of) the testimony which they held.</span> The seal indicates that the mission of the Christian Church can only be carried out in suffering. An altar is seen, and at its foot tokens of the martyrs who had laid down their lives upon it. The word "souls" is to be taken as the equivalent of "lives"; the vision tells that their lives had been sacrificed. The blood of the victims was in the temple service poured out at the foot of the altar. St. Paul makes use of the same imagery--"I am now ready to be <span class= "ital">poured out</span>" ("offered" in English version). In union with Christ Christians are called upon to suffer with Him, even to carry on to its great end the work of Christ in the world, and so fill up that which is lacking of the sufferings of Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>). The word "souls" has been made a resting-place for an argument respecting the intermediate state. There is no ground for this: it is quite beside the object of the seal, which simply exhibits the sufferings of Christ's people as the necessary accompaniment of the progress of the gospel. These sufferings are because of the Word of God and the testimony which they held. It was because of the Word of God and the testimony that the sacred seer himself suffered (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a>). The words here remind us that the same issue which St. John fought, the suffering ones of after ages would be fighting. Their witness and his was the God-man; to this testimony they clung. They were not ashamed of Christ, or of His words, and they suffered for their courage and fidelity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had opened the fifth seal;</span> <span class="accented">and when he opened</span>, as in vers. l, 3, 5, 7, which see. The second group of visions connected with the opening of the seals now commences. The first group deals with events more immediately attached to this life. By the visions of the first four seals St. John has shown that it is with God's knowledge and consent that afflictions and persecutions are allowed to try the faith of his servants on earth; while yet the ultimate triumph of those who endure is certain. In the last three appearances he goes a step further - he gives his readers a glimpse of events more immediately connected with the life in the world to come. He shows them <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the faithful, resting from their labours, though longing, in sympathy with those left on earth, for the completion of Christ's triumph; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the circumstances attendant upon our Lord's final coming, which he describes in language which is almost a repetition of Christ's words on the same subject; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the inexplicable life with God in heaven, which is denoted by the silence following the opening of the last seal. I saw under the altar. This representation is doubtless suggested by the arrangements of the temple. Victims were sacrificed on the brazen altar which stood at the door of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a> and Exodus 40:29), and the blood was poured out at the foot of this altar (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>). The martyrs are therefore regarded as having offered themselves as sacrifices upon the altar of God by yielding up their lives for him. St. Paul uses a similar figure concerning himself. In <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a> he says, "For I am now ready to be offered ['to pour out as a libation,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;</span>], and the time of any departure is at hand;" and in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, "If I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith." Bleek and De Wette understand the golden altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and consider that the figure is representative of the hearing of the martyrs' prayers. Bossuet says the altar is Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The souls of them that wore slain;</span> <span class="accented">them that had been slain.</span> An "aesthetical difficulty" (see on Revelation 4:6). How could St. John <span class="accented">see</span> the souls? Of course, he did not see them with his bodily vision, nor indeed did he thus see any part of the revelation. He "sees" them while "in the Spirit," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is somehow made conscious of the existence of the souls. <span class="accented">Slain</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "sacrificed;" the same word used of the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. The word is in harmony with the use of the word" altar," with which it is naturally connected. It fixes the signification of the altar, which therefore cannot bear the meaning ascribed by Block and De Wette, as mentioned above. St. John sees the <span class="accented">souls</span> only of the martyrs, since their bodies will not be reunited with their souls until the judgment day. Meanwhile, the <span class="accented">souls</span> rest (see ver. 11) in peace, yet in expectation of the final accomplishment of their perfect bliss, which the words used in ver. 10 show them to desire. Wordsworth quotes (as illustrating this passage) Tertullian, "The souls of martyrs repose in peace under the altar, and cherish a spirit of patience until others are admitted to fill up their communion of glow;" and Irenaeus, "The souls of the departed go to the place assigned them by God, and there abide until the resurrection, when they will be reunited to their bodies; and then the saints, both in soul and body, will come into the presence of God." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</span> B, Syriac, add, "and of the Lamb." <span class="accented">On account of the word</span>, etc. Exactly the same expression which St. John uses in <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a> in describing the cause of his own exile at Patmos. The language is peculiarly St. John's (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>, "John: who bare record of the Word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw;" also <a href="/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>, "The dragon... went to make war with... them which have the testimony of Jesus Christ;" also <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>, "I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.' The "Word of God" is of course <span class="accented">the truth which God has declared</span>, not <span class="accented">the Word</span> as in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. "The testimony which they held" may differ slightly in signification in different places. It may mean  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
