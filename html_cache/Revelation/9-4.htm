Unlike natural locusts, which typically consume vegetation, these creatures are instructed to avoid harming the grass, plants, or trees. This command highlights the supernatural nature of the judgment and suggests a targeted purpose. In biblical symbolism, grass and trees often represent life and prosperity (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). The restriction emphasizes that the judgment is not ecological but rather spiritual and moral, focusing on humanity rather than the environment.<p><b>but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads</b><br>This part of the verse identifies the specific targets of the judgment: people who lack the seal of God. The seal of God is a mark of divine protection and ownership, reminiscent of the blood on the doorposts during the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7, 13</a>) and the sealing of the 144,000 servants of God earlier in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3-4</a>). This seal signifies those who belong to God and are under His protection, contrasting with those who follow the beast and receive his mark (<a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16-17</a>). The sealing indicates a spiritual allegiance and protection from divine wrath, underscoring the theme of divine justice and mercy throughout Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locusts.htm">The Locusts</a></b><br>These are symbolic creatures released during the fifth trumpet judgment.

Everyone bears a mark; the only question is whose.<p>&#8226; Old Testament commandments were to be &#8220;between your eyes&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>), symbolizing continual, conspicuous devotion. Likewise, the seal here proclaims the believer&#8217;s covenant with God for all to see.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a> shows the fifth-trumpet locusts acting under strict divine orders. Their attack bypasses earth&#8217;s vegetation and falls exclusively on people lacking God&#8217;s protective seal. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty, His faithful distinction between His own and the unbelieving, and the public nature of spiritual allegiance. Those marked by God remain secure, while the unsealed face torment, proving yet again that refuge is found only in belonging to the Lamb.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And it was commanded </span>. . .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And it was commanded them that they shall not injure the grass of the earth, nor yet any green thing</span>, <span class= "ital">nor yet any tree; but only</span> (or, <span class= "ital">except) the men whosoever have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> The locusts which are sent not to injure the vegetation are clearly not literal locusts, and the security of those who have the seal of God in their foreheads (those who were described as sealed, and so assured of safety against the tempest blast: see <a href="/context/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1-3</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.) </span>may confirm us in this view. Whatever the plague be, it is one which cannot injure God's children. "Nothing," Christ has said, "shall by any means hurt you. I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy" (<a href="/luke/10-19.htm" title="Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.">Luke 10:19</a>). It is interesting and suggestive to notice that this promise of our Lord was given immediately after the saying, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven," as the safety of the sealed ones is mentioned here after the vision of the star fallen from heaven. The coincidence is hardly undesigned; at least, the sense in which we understand the danger from which Christ promised His disciples protection may afford us a guiding meaning here. Now, none have maintained that Christ promised His disciples entire freedom from danger, pain, and death. He said, "They shall persecute you and kill you; ye shall be hated of all men for My name's sake, but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." No real injury can happen to them; pain and death might be encountered, but all things work together for their higher good. They have a joy which no pain or peril can take away; they have a joy in this (it is the same chapter as above--Luke 10), that their "names are written in heaven." For such, death has no sting, the grave no victory. They meet famine and nakedness, and peril and sword; but in these they are more than conquerors. No plague can hurt those who have the seal of God in their foreheads. A plague from which those whose way is through tribulation are exempt can hardly be a physical one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree.</span> The force of this plague is to fall directly upon mankind, not, as in the former judgments, upon the earth, and then indirectly upon men. This appears to be stated with the greater plainness, because it might readily be inferred, from the nature of locusts, that the immediate object of their destructiveness would be the vegetation of the world. <span class="cmt_word">But only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;</span> <span class="accented">but only such men as have not</span>, etc. (Revised Version; cf. <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>, to which this is an allusion). Here, by proleipsis, the servants of God are described as "those that have the seal of God in their foreheads." It is not stated, nor is it necessarily implied, that the seal is visible to man at the time of the infliction of this judgment upon the ungodly. In a similar way our Lord speaks of the elect (<a href="/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>), not thereby implying that there is any visible manifestation by which the elect may be known to men, though known to God (so also <a href="/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>, etc.). Thus also it is said in <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his." The frequent use of the term to denote those who were sealed by baptism may have led to the employment of the expression in this place, as being equivalent to "the servants of God" (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>). The locusts may not hurt God's servants (see on ver. 3). Thus we are taught that God in reality preserves his own, though it may sometimes appear to man as though the innocent suffer with the guilty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autais)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Feminine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
