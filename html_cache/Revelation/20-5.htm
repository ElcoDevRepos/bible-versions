In the context of <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>, the "rest of the dead" are those who have not been resurrected to reign with Christ during the millennial kingdom. This period, often referred to as the Millennium, is a thousand-year reign of Christ on earth, a concept rooted in Jewish eschatology and expanded in Christian theology. The idea of a millennial reign is linked to Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>, which describe a time of peace and divine rule. The phrase suggests a distinction between two groups: those who are resurrected to reign with Christ and those who await a later resurrection. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of a final judgment, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>, where a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked is anticipated.<p><b>This is the first resurrection.</b><br>The "first resurrection" is a term that signifies the resurrection of the righteous, those who have been faithful to Christ and are granted the privilege of reigning with Him during the Millennium. This concept is central to the hope of eternal life and victory over death, as promised in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>. The first resurrection is often interpreted as a reward for those who have remained steadfast in their faith, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, where those who have been martyred for their testimony are specifically mentioned. This resurrection is a fulfillment of the promise of eternal life and is seen as a precursor to the final resurrection and judgment, where all will be raised and judged according to their deeds, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. Theologically, the first resurrection underscores the hope of believers in the ultimate triumph over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who is the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rest_of_the_dead.htm">The Rest of the Dead</a></b><br>Refers to those who did not partake in the first resurrection.

The righteous rise first and share Christ&#8217;s millennial reign; the unrighteous remain dead until the thousand years end, when they are raised for final judgment. The verse therefore underscores both the completeness of salvation for believers and the certainty of judgment for unbelievers, all on a literal timeline God has revealed and will unfailingly keep.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">But the rest of the dead lived not again . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">The rest of the dead lived not</span> (we must omit the word "<span class= "ital">again"</span>)<span class= "ital"> until the thousand years be finished. This is the first resurrection.</span> In those words we meet one of the keys to the controversy respecting the millennium. What is this resurrection? Is it the resurrection at which the saints shall assume the glorified bodies, and their perfect consummation and bliss? It has been argued that the word must be understood literally as of a bodily resurrection. It is further said that the contrasting words ("the rest of the dead lived not") necessitate this literal interpretation. But there is no reason for restricting the word Resurrection to a literal meaning. The sacred writers frequently use the idea figuratively. They speak of a resurrection which is spiritual; the dead in sin are summoned to rise from the dead that Christ might give them light (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>); indeed, the figure often underlies the language and arguments of New Testament writers (<a href="/context/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24-25</a>; <a href="/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2Corinthians 5:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>). But do the words, "the rest of the dead lived not," force upon us so sharp a contrast that we must understand the first resurrection literally? Undoubtedly the words are in contrast. If the words "lived not" necessarily mean that the rest of the dead did not enjoy physical life on earth, then the living with Christ of the saints and the first resurrection must be understood as giving physical life on earth to the saints. But are we bound to thus understand literally the "lived" of <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm" title="And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.">Revelation 20:4</a> and the "lived not" of <a href="/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5</a>? There are two or three considerations which will be enough to show that they need not be understood thus. (1) The word "to <span class= "ital">live"</span> is used about sixteen times in the Apocalypse. On nine of these it is applied to the eternal life of God the Father or God the Son; it is twice used in the passage before us (<a href="/context/revelation/20-4.htm" title="And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.">Revelation 20:4-5</a>). Of the remaining five occasions where the word is used, it is four times employed in what can scarcely be other than a figurative sense (<a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm" title="For the Lamb which is in the middle of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm" title="And deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm" title="And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.">Revelation 19:20</a>--some <span class= "ital">might</span> doubt the figurative use in this last passage), but only once is it employed in a sense which can fairly be defended as literal (<a href="/revelation/16-3.htm" title="And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.">Revelation 16:3</a>). (2) There will be faithless people during the millennium--the nations <span class= "ital">to be deceived </span>(<a href="/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.">Revelation 20:8</a>). Are we then to picture saints with glorified resurrection bodies living on the earth, which at the same time is tenanted by men and women still in the natural body? (3) There is a resurrection, which surely is the second resurrection, described in <a href="/context/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12-13</a> : this last is a general resurrection of the dead, small and great. There seems no adequate reason to affirm that this first resurrection, then, <span class= "ital">must</span> be physical. Our notions of life and death are so circumscribed by the geography of earth, that we seldom give to the word "life" in our thoughts its true richness and fulness of meaning. We fail to remember that the faithful ones who live, because Christ lives, have the promise of the life that now is, as well as that which is to come; we forget that God is not God of the dead, but of the living. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished;</span> <span class="accented">should be finished.</span> Omit "but;" omit "again." It is important to notice the omission of "again;" <span class="accented">the rest of the dead lived not until</span>, etc. The best explanation of these words seems to be that the "rest of the dead" refers to those Old Testament saints and others (such as godly heathens) who were in the world before Christ's act of atonement - "the thousand years" (see on ver. 2, above) - had been accomplished. They could not be said to have <span class="accented">lived</span>, in the high sense in which St. John uses the word, not having known Christ; for "in him was life" (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>, etc.). But by Christ's redeeming work, these were placed on a level with Christians (cf. <a href="/luke/7-28.htm">Luke 7:28</a>, "John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he;" also <a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39, 40</a>, "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect"). <span class="cmt_word">This is the first resurrection.</span> These words refer both to the reigning of those mentioned in ver. 4, and to the living of those in ver. 5 (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This "first resurrection" is the spiritual rising with Christ, which is a consequence of his redeeming work. It is to be noticed that St. John nowhere makes use of the phrase, "second resurrection," though he does use the words, "second death."
