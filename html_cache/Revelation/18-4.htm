The voice from heaven suggests a direct communication from God or an angelic messenger. In biblical literature, heavenly voices often convey important revelations or instructions, as seen in other instances like the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Come out of her, My people,</b><br>This call to "come out" is reminiscent of God's call to Lot to leave Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-12.htm">Genesis 19:12-14</a>) and the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-33</a>). It signifies a separation from sin and impending judgment. "My people" indicates that God is addressing believers, urging them to dissociate from the corrupt system symbolized by "her," often interpreted as Babylon, representing a world system opposed to God.<p><b>so that you will not share in her sins</b><br>The warning to avoid sharing in her sins highlights the danger of complicity and moral contamination. This echoes the biblical principle of being in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). The call to holiness and separation from sin is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, urging believers to live distinctively (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>or contract any of her plagues.</b><br>The mention of plagues draws a parallel to the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-11), symbolizing divine judgment. It serves as a warning of the consequences of remaining aligned with a sinful system. The plagues in Revelation are part of the eschatological judgments, emphasizing the severity of God's wrath against sin and the protection offered to those who heed His call to separate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_from_heaven.htm">Voice from Heaven</a></b><br>This is a divine command, likely from God or an angel, urging God's people to separate themselves from Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>Symbolic of a corrupt and sinful system or city, often interpreted as representing worldly powers or influences that oppose God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_people.htm">My People</a></b><br>Refers to the followers of God, those who are called to live according to His will and separate themselves from sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sins_and_plagues.htm">Sins and Plagues</a></b><br>Represents the moral and spiritual corruption of Babylon and the divine judgment that will befall it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_holiness.htm">Call to Holiness</a></b><br>Believers are called to live distinct lives, separate from the corrupt systems of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_obedience.htm">Urgency of Obedience</a></b><br>The command to "come out" is immediate, emphasizing the need for prompt action in aligning with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_complicity_in_sin.htm">Avoiding Complicity in Sin</a></b><br>Engaging with or tolerating sinful systems can lead to sharing in their judgment.

It is not necessary to say whose voice it is; that it is a voice of divine love giving warning is enough. The coming forth is not to be understood of a bodily exodus from Rome. It is rather the warning which is so needful in every corrupt state of society, to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; to practise that separation from the spirit of the world which is essential lest we should be entangled in the meshes of its sinful habits. This duty of separation may sometimes lead to a literal exodus, and even under the pressure of overwhelming necessity to secession from a world-corrupted church; but the jeopardy lies in attachment to the world-spirit (<a href="/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1John 2:15</a>). The parallel warnings in <a href="/jeremiah/51-6.htm" title="Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.">Jeremiah 51:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-45.htm" title="My people, go you out of the middle of her, and deliver you every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.">Jeremiah 51:45</a>, and <a href="/context/zechariah/2-6.htm" title="Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:6-7</a>, should be read; but the story of Lot in Sodom best illustrates the spirit of the passage (Genesis 19), for it is participation in sin which is to be primarily guarded against.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying.</span> Probably the voice of another angel in succession to the one mentioned in ver. 1. Another angel takes up the theme, because the message is now directly addressed to Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</span> The angel says, "my people," because he is representing God. These words, resembling <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52.htm">Isaiah 52</a>:l; <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; and especially <a href="/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a> (cf. also ver. 8), 45, recall also the warning of our Lord in <a href="/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a> (cf. also <a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>, "I cannot do anything till thou be come thither"). Since the harlot, who is identical with Babylon, is representative of the faithless part of the Church of God, these words form a direct warning to Christians. The departure which is commanded is not necessarily a literal, visible one; but the command implies a dissociation from, and condemnation of, the works of Babylon. Lot's wife literally departed from Sodom, but was overtaken with punishment, because her heart was not dissevered from the wickedness of the city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/18-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
