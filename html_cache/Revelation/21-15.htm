Angels often serve as messengers or guides in biblical visions, as seen in Daniel and Ezekiel. The presence of an angel underscores the divine authority and significance of the revelation being given. Angels are frequently depicted as God's servants who execute His will, emphasizing the heavenly origin of the message.<p><b>had a golden measuring rod</b><br>The use of a measuring rod is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>, where a man with a measuring rod measures the temple. Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, suggests the perfection and holiness of what is being measured. The act of measuring signifies God's ownership and the precision of His plans. It also indicates the importance of the city being measured, as it is set apart for a divine purpose.<p><b>to measure the city</b><br>The city being measured is the New Jerusalem, a central theme in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. This city represents the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to dwell with His people. Measuring the city signifies its completeness and readiness as the eternal dwelling place for believers. The New Jerusalem is depicted as a place of perfect harmony and beauty, reflecting God's glory.<p><b>and its gates</b><br>The gates of the city are significant as they symbolize access and security. In ancient cities, gates were crucial for protection and controlled entry. The New Jerusalem's gates, described later in Revelation as being made of pearl, signify the beauty and value of entry into God's eternal kingdom. The gates also represent the tribes of Israel, connecting the New Jerusalem to God's covenant people.<p><b>and walls</b><br>The walls of the city symbolize protection and separation from all that is unholy. In biblical times, city walls were essential for defense against enemies. The walls of the New Jerusalem, described as being made of jasper, indicate the strength and impenetrability of God's eternal kingdom. They also serve as a boundary, ensuring that only those who are redeemed may enter, highlighting the purity and sanctity of the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who guides John in his vision, symbolizing God's authority and precision in the unfolding of His plans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>The apostle and author of Revelation, receiving visions of the end times and the new creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the New Jerusalem, a symbol of God's eternal dwelling place with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates_and_walls.htm">Gates and Walls</a></b><br>Represent the security, perfection, and holiness of the New Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/golden_measuring_rod.htm">Golden Measuring Rod</a></b><br>A tool used by the angel, symbolizing divine standards and the perfection of God's creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_precision.htm">Divine Precision</a></b><br>God's plans are exact and perfect, as symbolized by the measuring rod.
