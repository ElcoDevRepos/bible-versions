The term "deeds" refers to their works and actions, which are visible expressions of their faith. "Labor" suggests hard work and toil, indicating that their efforts were not without cost or sacrifice. "Perseverance" highlights their endurance and steadfastness in the face of challenges. Historically, Ephesus was a major city in Asia Minor, known for its commerce and the Temple of Artemis. The church there faced significant opposition, both from pagan practices and from within, as false teachings began to emerge. This commendation reflects their commitment to maintaining their faith despite these pressures.<p><b>I know that you cannot tolerate those who are evil,</b><br>The church in Ephesus is praised for its intolerance of evil, which aligns with biblical teachings that call for holiness and separation from sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). This intolerance is not about personal dislike but a commitment to uphold the truth and purity of the Gospel. In a city like Ephesus, where idolatry and immorality were rampant, maintaining such a stance would have been challenging. This phrase underscores the importance of discernment and moral integrity within the Christian community.<p><b>and you have tested and exposed as liars those who falsely claim to be apostles.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the church's role in safeguarding doctrinal purity. The early church faced numerous false teachers and prophets, as warned by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and Paul in <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>. The Ephesian church is commended for their discernment and ability to test these claims against the truth of the Gospel. The term "apostles" refers to those who claimed authority and teaching rights within the church. By exposing them as liars, the Ephesian believers protected the community from false doctrines. This vigilance reflects the broader biblical theme of testing spirits and teachings (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>) to ensure alignment with the truth of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_ephesus.htm">The Church in Ephesus</a></b><br>This is the recipient of the message.

The Revised Version is to be preferred throughout. <span class="cmt_word">I know thy works</span>. This introductory "I know" appears in all seven letters. He whose eyes are "as a flame of fire" (<a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>) has perfect knowledge of his servants, and this knowledge is the basis of the praise and blame. "Works," a favourite word with St. John, and very frequent in both Gospel and Apocalypse, is used in a wide sense, including the whole of conduct (comp. <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19, 20</a>; <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 7</a>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39, 41</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8, 12</a> 2John 11 <a href="/3_john/1-10.htm">3 John 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy toil and patience</span>. Explanatory of "thy works;" the Ephesians know how to toil and how to suffer patiently. They have "learned to labour and to wait." St. Ignatius says that he must be trained "in patience and long suffering" by the Ephesians ('Ephes.,' 3.). <span class="cmt_word">And that thou canst not bear evil men</span>. Again St. Ignatius supplies a commentary: "Now, Onesimus of his own accord highly praiseth your orderly conduct in God, for that ye all live according to truth, and that <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">heresy hath a home among you</span>; nay, ye <span class="accented">do not so much as listen to any one</span>, if he speak of aught else save concerning Jesus Christ in truth" ('Ephes.,' 6.). The word for "evil" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), though one of the commonest in the Greek language, is rare in St. John; it occurs only here and in <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a> (see note); <a href="/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a> 3John 11. <span class="cmt_word">Didst try them which call themselves apostles, and they are not</span>. It is incredible that this can mean St. Paul. Even allowing the prodigious assumption that the "Jewish Christianity" of St. John was opposed to the "Gentile Christianity" of St. Paul, what chance would an opponent of St. Paul have had in a Church which St. Paul founded and fostered? And had such opposition existed, could St. Polycarp, St. John's own disciple, have spoken of "the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul" ('Philippians,' 3.)? This mention of false apostles is doubly interesting: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a fulfilment of warnings given by St. Paul himself to the Ephesian Church (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-30</a>; comp. 2 Timothy, <span class="accented">passim</span>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a strong incidental mark of the date of the book. In A.D. , when contemporaries of the apostles were abundant, the claim to be an apostle might with some show of reason be made; in A.D. such a claim would be ridiculous. This Trench admits, and hence tells us that the meaning of "apostles" must not be pressed, "as though it implied a claim to have seen and been sent by the Lord Jesus," But this is just what "apostle" does imply (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
