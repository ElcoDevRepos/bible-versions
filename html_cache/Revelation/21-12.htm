In ancient times, city walls were essential for defense against enemies, symbolizing strength and stability. This wall represents the impenetrable nature of the New Jerusalem, ensuring that nothing impure can enter (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>). The wall's grandeur also reflects the glory and majesty of God&#8217;s eternal kingdom.<p><b>with twelve gates</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout Scripture, often symbolizing completeness and God's divine order. The twelve gates suggest accessibility and the welcoming nature of God's kingdom, open to all who are redeemed. In <a href="/ezekiel/48-30.htm">Ezekiel 48:30-35</a>, a similar vision of a city with twelve gates is described, each named after the tribes of Israel, indicating continuity between the Old and New Covenants.<p><b>inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel</b><br>The inscription of the twelve tribes' names highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the integral role of the Jewish people in salvation history. It underscores the unity of God's people, both Jews and Gentiles, in the New Jerusalem. This connection to the tribes of Israel also points to the covenantal faithfulness of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> and <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the tribes are listed and blessed.<p><b>and twelve angels at the gates</b><br>The presence of twelve angels at the gates signifies divine guardianship and the holiness of the city. Angels often serve as messengers and protectors in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where cherubim guard the way to the Tree of Life. Their role here emphasizes the sacredness of the New Jerusalem and the divine order maintained within its walls.

There is perhaps allusion in the present passage to this wilderness encampment, and to the re-adjustment of the order of the tribes in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 48); but there is more than order here: the gates lie open to all quarters; there is no refusal of admission to any people.
