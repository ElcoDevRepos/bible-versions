In <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, God leads the Israelites by a pillar of cloud, signifying His guidance and protection. The white cloud here suggests purity and holiness, indicating a heavenly scene. Clouds are frequently associated with theophanies, or appearances of God, as seen in the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).<p><b>and seated on the cloud was One like the Son of Man</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. This phrase is a direct reference to Jesus Christ, who often used this title for Himself (e.g., <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). The seated position indicates authority and sovereignty, as sitting is a posture of judgment and kingship.<p><b>with a golden crown on His head</b><br>The golden crown signifies victory and kingship. Gold, being a precious metal, represents value and purity. In Revelation, crowns are often associated with authority and reward (<a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10, 4</a>:4). This crown indicates Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, affirming His role as King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>and a sharp sickle in His hand</b><br>The sickle is a tool for harvesting, symbolizing judgment and the gathering of the righteous and the wicked. In <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>, a similar image is used to describe the judgment of nations. The sharpness of the sickle emphasizes the decisiveness and thoroughness of Christ's judgment. This imagery aligns with the parable of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where the harvest represents the end of the age and the separation of the righteous from the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>This title is often used for Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His authority in judgment.
