Pergamum was a significant city in Asia Minor, known for its cultural and political influence. It was a center of pagan worship, which included temples dedicated to Zeus, Athena, and other deities. The phrase reassures the believers that Christ is aware of their challenges and the spiritual environment they face.<p><b>where the throne of Satan sits</b><br>This refers to the pervasive pagan worship and possibly the altar of Zeus, which was prominent in Pergamum. The city was also a center for emperor worship, which Christians would have found particularly oppressive. The "throne of Satan" symbolizes the stronghold of idolatry and opposition to the Christian faith in the city.<p><b>yet you hold fast to My name</b><br>Despite the hostile environment, the believers in Pergamum remained steadfast in their faith. Holding fast to Christ's name implies loyalty and commitment to His teachings and identity. This perseverance is commendable and reflects the call to remain faithful amidst persecution, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>.<p><b>You did not deny your faith in Me</b><br>The believers' refusal to renounce their faith, even under pressure, highlights their courage and dedication. This echoes the call to endure in <a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>, where Jesus promises salvation to those who stand firm to the end. Their faithfulness serves as an example for all believers facing trials.<p><b>even in the days of My faithful witness Antipas</b><br>Antipas is described as a "faithful witness," a title also used for Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>. This suggests that Antipas exemplified Christ-like faithfulness, even unto death. Although little is known about Antipas outside this passage, his martyrdom underscores the severe persecution faced by early Christians.<p><b>who was killed among you</b><br>This indicates that Antipas was martyred in Pergamum, making his death a public testimony of faith. His martyrdom would have been a significant event for the local church, serving both as a warning and an inspiration to other believers.<p><b>where Satan dwells</b><br>Reiterating the earlier mention of "the throne of Satan," this phrase emphasizes the spiritual darkness and opposition present in Pergamum. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing spiritual battle and the need for vigilance and faithfulness in the face of evil, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pergamum.htm">Pergamum</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, known for its cultural and religious significance.

The word is translated elsewhere "throne," and should be here, "Where the throne of Satan is." But why should this pre-eminence in evil be assigned to Pergamos? The answer is difficult. Some leave it unsolved, saying that in the absence of any historical notice, it must remain one of the unsolved riddles of these epistles. Prof. Plumptre suggests that the general character of the city, its worship and customs, in addition to the persecutions which the Christians had encountered, may well account for the description. 'sculapius was worshipped as the "Preserver," or "Saviour." The symbol of the serpent must have been conspicuous among the objects of adoration in his temple. Curious arts were practised; lying wonders were claimed; persecution had extended to death. Such evil in such a city may have led to its being regarded as the very head-quarters of the enemy.<p><span class= "bld">Hast not denied.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Thou didst not deny My faith in the days in which Antipas My faithful witness, was slain, </span>&c.<p><span class= "bld">Antipas.</span>--Short for Antipater.

The words, "thy works and," are certainly an insertion here - both external and internal evidence are against them. Even where Satan's throne is. We must translate <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "throne" here, as in <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10</a>, etc. Throughout the Apocalypse heaven and hell are set over against one another; and as God has his throne, so also has Satan. The Authorized Version inconsistently alternates between "seat" (<a href="/revelation/11-16.htm">Revelation 11:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>) and "throne," even in the same verse (<a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). "The throne of Satan" has perplexed commentators. It probably refers to the infamous idolatry practised at Pergamum, which had a cluster of temples to Zeus, Apollo, Athene, Dionysus, Aphrodite, and AEsculapius. These all lay together in a beautiful grove called the Nicephorium, the pride of Pergamum, as the temple of Artemis was the pride of Ephesus. Some have thought that the mention of Satan points to the serpent, which is so prominent in the cultus of Aesculapius. But the context leads us rather to understand the abominations connected with the worship of Dionysus and Aphrodite. Others, again, think that "the <span class="accented">throne</span> of Satan" indicates the persecuting judgments pronounced against Christians; for Pergamum was a great judicial centre. We must be content to leave the question open. <span class="cmt_word">Thou holdest fast my Name</span>. We have the same expression (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with the accusative) three times in this epistle and again in ver. 25 and <a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>. Just as in the literal sense <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the accusative means "to seize" a man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his whole person (<a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-29.htm">Matthew 18:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>), as distinct from laying hold of a part (<a href="/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>; <a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>), so in the figurative sense <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with the accusative is "to hold fast" the whole of (<a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3, 4, 8</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>), as distinct from keeping a share in a possession common to many (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>). On the emphatic repetition obtained by denying the opposite, "holdest fast and didst not deny," see notes on Revelation 3:8. The Greek text in what follows is a good deal confused, and cannot be determined with certainty; but the general sense is clear. In any case, "my witness, my faithful one" (Revised Version), is more accurate than "my faithful martyr" (Authorized Version). The reduplication of the article is frequent in St. John's writings, but in some cases it produces clumsiness to reproduce it in English: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> occurs here of Antipas, and in <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a> of Christ; compare <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>), with <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9, 11</a>; <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38, 42, 44, 50, 51, 58</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; 7:68; 8:16; 12:26; 14:15, 27; 15:9, 11; 17:13, 24; 18:36; <a href="/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7</a> 2John 13. Of Antipas nothing is known. The name is a shortened form of Antipater, as Nicomas of Nicomedes, Artemas of Artemidorus, Hermes of Hermodorus, Zenas of Zenodorus, Menas of Menodorus, Lucas of Lucanus, Domas of Demetrius; and therefore is not derived from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Much mystical trifling has been expended over the name Antipas, which no doubt is the actual name of a once well-known sufferer for the truth. Probably of the Pergamene confessors, Antipas was the only one who was called upon to suffer death. The silence of Church history respecting a martyr thus honoured in Scripture is strange. Attalus, one of the chief martyrs of Lyons, was of Pergamum (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' V. 1:17; comp. IV. 15:48). The repetition of <span class="accented">"where</span> Satan dwelleth" emphasizes this point, like the repetition of <span class="accented">"repent"</span> in ver. 5. It rather confirms the view that by "Satan's throne" is meant the judgment throne where the martyrs were condemned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(pou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4226.htm">Strong's 4226: </a> </span><span class="str2">Genitive case of an interrogative pronoun pos otherwise obsolete; as adverb of place; at what locality.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you live,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(katoikeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2730.htm">Strong's 2730: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dwell in, settle in, be established in (permanently), inhabit.
