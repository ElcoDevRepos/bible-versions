In ancient times, a name inscribed on a garment or body part indicated possession or identity. The robe represents majesty and righteousness, often associated with kingship and priesthood. The thigh, a symbol of strength and power, suggests the might and authority of the one who bears the name. This dual inscription emphasizes the visible and undeniable authority of Christ as He returns in glory. The act of writing on the thigh may also allude to ancient practices where warriors bore marks or symbols of their allegiance.<p><b>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</b><br>This title affirms the supreme sovereignty of Christ over all earthly and heavenly rulers. It echoes the language found in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>, where Christ is described as the "blessed and only Sovereign." The title "King of Kings" and "Lord of Lords" underscores His ultimate authority and dominion, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies like those in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the Son of Man is given everlasting dominion. This phrase also contrasts with earthly kings and lords, highlighting the futility of human power in comparison to divine sovereignty. The repetition of "King" and "Lord" emphasizes the completeness and perfection of His rule, a central theme in the book of Revelation, which portrays the final victory of Christ over all opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the triumphant King.

The supper or banquet is the chief meal in the day, the meal to which guests would be invited. The banquet or supper here is in contrast with the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

All classes--the great and small, the master and slave--are mentioned. Those who follow the world-power, and array themselves in hostility to the true King, belong not to one class, but may be found among all. The war is not between class and class, but between righteousness and unrighteousness, truth and falsehood, Christ and Belial. We must remember that the vision is a great figurative representation of the defeat of the anti-Christian powers and principles in the world; this will save us from misapprehending its purpose, and from a bondaged literalism. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written.</span> What this means is doubtful.
