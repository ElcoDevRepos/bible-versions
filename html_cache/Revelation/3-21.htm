The concept of "overcoming" is a recurring theme in the letters to the seven churches in Revelation. It implies a spiritual triumph over sin, temptation, and the trials of life. The term "overcomes" is linked to the Greek word "nikao," which means to conquer or gain victory. This victory is not achieved through human strength but through faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4-5</a>, which states that faith is the victory that overcomes the world.<p><b>I will grant the right to sit with Me on My throne</b><br>This promise signifies a sharing in Christ's authority and victory. In ancient times, sitting on a throne was a symbol of power, authority, and rulership. The imagery here reflects the believer's future participation in Christ's reign, as also mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, where it is stated that if we endure, we will also reign with Him. This promise is a profound assurance of the believer's ultimate destiny and reward.<p><b>just as I overcame</b><br>Jesus' overcoming is a reference to His victory over sin, death, and the powers of darkness through His life, death, and resurrection. This phrase highlights the pattern that believers are to follow, as Jesus is the ultimate example of overcoming. His victory is the foundation for the believer's victory, as He has already conquered the world (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><b>and sat down with My Father on His throne</b><br>This part of the verse points to the exaltation of Christ after His resurrection, as He ascended to heaven and took His place at the right hand of the Father. This is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and is affirmed in <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, which describes Jesus sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high. It signifies the completion of His redemptive work and His supreme authority over all creation. The believer's future sharing in this throne is a testament to the intimate relationship and unity with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_overcomer.htm">The Overcomer</a></b><br>Refers to believers who remain faithful and victorious in their spiritual journey, overcoming sin and the challenges of the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this promise, who overcame sin and death through His life, death, and resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes authority, power, and victory.

The pattern is Christ&#8217;s own journey: He conquered, was exalted, and now invites us to follow. The promise is relational (&#8220;with Me&#8221;), royal (&#8220;on My throne&#8221;), and gracious (&#8220;I will grant&#8221;). Grounded in His completed work and present authority, it calls believers to steadfast, overcoming lives, confident that eternal communion and co-reigning with the Savior await.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">To him that overcometh </span>... .--He will share Christ's throne as Christ shared His Father's throne. Here are two thrones mentioned. My throne, saith Christ: this is the condition of glorified saints who sit with Christ in His throne. "But My Father's <span class= "ital">(i.e., </span>God's) throne is the power of divine majesty." Herein none may sit but God, and the God-man Jesus Christ. The promise of sharing the throne is the climax of an ascending series of glorious promises, which carry the thought from the Garden of Eden (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>) through the wilderness (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>), the temple (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>), to the throne. The promise bears marked resemblance to the language of St. Paul to the Ephesians (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>). This crowning promise is made to the most unpleasing of the churches. But it is well that thus the despondency which often succeeds the sudden collapse of self-satisfied imaginations should be met by so bright a prospect. Though their religion has been proved an empty thing, there is a hope which may well drive away despair. "The highest place is within the reach of the lowest; the faintest spark of grace may be fanned into the mightiest flame of divine love."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne</span>.

There are two points to be noticed in this promise: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the position promised to the conqueror, "in my throne;" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the two thrones mentioned. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Note the expression, "<span class="accented">in</span> my throne" (not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which occurs nowhere else. The mother of St. James and St. John had requested for them a place on the right hand and the left of our Lord - the highest dignity which she could conceive. The twelve apostles are promised to sit on twelve thrones, to judge the tribes of Israel.
