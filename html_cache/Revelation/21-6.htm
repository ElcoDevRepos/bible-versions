It emphasizes the personal nature of the revelation and the authority of the message. Throughout the Bible, God speaks directly to His prophets, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p><b>It is done!</b><br>This declaration signifies the completion of God's redemptive plan. It echoes Jesus' words on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), indicating the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His eternal kingdom. The phrase underscores the finality and certainty of God's purposes.<p><b>I am the Alpha and the Omega</b><br>Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing completeness and eternity. This title for God appears in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8 and 22</a>:13, affirming His eternal nature and sovereign control over history. It highlights God's omnipresence and omnipotence, encompassing all time and creation.<p><b>the Beginning and the End</b><br>This phrase reinforces God's eternal existence and His role as the Creator and Consummator of all things. It connects to <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>, where God declares Himself as the first and the last. It assures believers of God's unchanging nature and His ultimate authority over the universe.<p><b>To the thirsty I will give freely</b><br>This promise reflects God's grace and generosity. The imagery of thirst is often used in Scripture to describe spiritual longing (<a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>). The offer of free water signifies salvation and the satisfaction of spiritual needs without cost, emphasizing the gift of grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>from the spring of the water of life</b><br>The water of life symbolizes eternal life and spiritual renewal. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a> and finds fulfillment in Jesus' offer of living water (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).

The Almighty announces the irreversible completion of His plan, identifies Himself as the sovereign Lord of all time, and extends a gracious, cost-free invitation to every parched heart. The same God who authored creation now offers everlasting refreshment from His own life-giving spring, assuring us that His victory and our satisfaction are both eternally secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And he said unto me, It is done.</span>--Or, rather, <span class= "ital">They</span> (the things promised) <span class= "ital">have come to pass.</span> He spake, and it was done. The assurance is made trebly sure. "I am making all things new." "These words are true." "They are fulfilled." "Twice," says Bengel, "twice it is said in this book 'It is done.' First at the completion of the wrath of God in <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>, and here again at the making of all things new."<p><span class= "bld">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end . . .</span>--The definite article must be placed before Alpha and Omega. <span class= "ital">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.</span> He is the Alpha and Omega, whose words are faithful and true, and He is the beginning and the end, who is before all things and by whom all things consist (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). He finishes as well as begins. He who begins the good work will perform it (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>); all grace flows from Him; and all love flows back to Him, who is Love, who is the cause and end of all, who first makes us, and lastly makes us rest in Him. All the unsatisfied yearnings of the heart may find satisfaction in Him. Hence, perhaps, this promise, <span class= "ital">I to him that thirsteth will give out of the spring of the water of life freely.</span> No promise shall fail--the needy and thirsty so often invited to Him may find fresh springs of life in Him. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/context/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10-14</a>; <a href="/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-38</a>.) The blessing is promised freely, as an unbought gift, without money and without price. This is the genius of the good news of God--the gift is free to all. He who understands this will not be afraid to say, "Nothing in my hand I bring;" and he who says this will be he who will also say, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ," so that he who brings everything brings nothing; and he who brings nothing brings everything, knowing that all is nothing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, It is done;</span> <span class="accented">and he said unto me, They are come to pass</span> (Revised Version). It is uncertain what is the nominative intended. It may be the "words" just mentioned; or the incidents described in vers. 1-5; or the Divine promises and judgments in general. The analogy of <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a> supports the last, but it is not conclusive. <span class="cmt_word">I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End;</span> <span class="accented">the Alpha and the Omega.</span> As the book opens, so it closes, with the solemn assurance of the certainty and unchangeableness of God's eternal promises (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>). The second clause interprets the first; a third form of expressing the same idea occurs in <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the First and the Last." I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. The same ideas are repeated in <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13-17</a>. Again the symbolism of the prophet (cf. ver. 3). There is also another reminiscence of <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. also ver. 4 of this chapter). In exactly the same sense the words, "living water," are used in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a> (cf. also <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "thirst after righteousness"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/21-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#941;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
