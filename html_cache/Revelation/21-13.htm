The east holds significant biblical symbolism, often representing the direction from which God's glory appears (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). The Garden of Eden was placed in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the wise men came from the east to worship Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). The gates facing east may symbolize the entrance of God's presence and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>three on the north</b><br>The north is sometimes associated with God's judgment and power (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). In ancient Israel, enemies often attacked from the north, making it a direction associated with danger and divine protection. The inclusion of gates on the north side signifies God's sovereignty and the protection He offers from all directions. It also emphasizes the universality of God's kingdom, open to all nations.<p><b>three on the south</b><br>The south is often associated with warmth and blessing, as it is the direction of the Negev, a region in Israel known for its fertility and abundance. The presence of gates on the south side may symbolize the blessings and prosperity that come from God. It also reflects the inclusivity of the New Jerusalem, welcoming people from all directions and backgrounds.<p><b>and three on the west</b><br>The west is significant in biblical history as the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, representing the unknown and the Gentile nations. The western gates highlight the expansion of God's kingdom beyond Israel to include all peoples. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the prophecy of the inclusion of the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).
