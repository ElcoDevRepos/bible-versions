In the context of Revelation, Jesus addresses the seven churches in Asia Minor, each with specific messages. The commendation here serves as a positive reinforcement amidst the rebuke for having lost their first love (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>). It highlights the importance of discernment and standing against false teachings, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>).<p><b>You hate the works of the Nicolaitans,</b><br>The Nicolaitans are mentioned in <a href="/revelation/2-6.htm">Revelation 2:6 and 2</a>:15, but little is known about them outside these references. They are believed to be a sect that promoted a form of antinomianism, which is the belief that Christians are released by grace from the obligation of observing the moral law. This aligns with the warnings against false teachings and immoral practices found in other New Testament writings (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). The church in Ephesus is commended for rejecting these practices, showing their commitment to doctrinal purity and moral integrity.<p><b>which I also hate.</b><br>This phrase underscores the alignment between the church's stance and Jesus' own perspective. It emphasizes the seriousness with which Jesus views false teachings and immoral practices. The use of the word "hate" indicates a strong disapproval, reflecting the biblical principle that God is holy and calls His people to holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). This alignment with Christ's values is crucial for the church's witness and mission, as seen throughout the New Testament (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicolaitans.htm">Nicolaitans</a></b><br>A group mentioned in the early Christian church, known for practices and teachings that were contrary to apostolic doctrine.

The life and conduct were little thought of, and the faith professed was everything. Some have thought that they were a sect who derived their name, under some colourable pretext, from Nicolas the Proselyte; others hold that the name is purely symbolical, signifying "destroyer of the people," and that it is no more than the Greek form of Balaam. (See Notes on <a href="/context/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14-15</a>, below.) The existence of a sect called Nicolaitanes in the second century is attested by Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - They are again commended for their good points. But it is possible to hate what Christ hates without loving what he loves. It is possible to hate false doctrine and lawlessness, and yet be formal and dead one's self. Who the <span class="cmt_word">Nicolaitans</span> were we cannot now determine with certainty. The name Nicolaus may be intended as a Greek equivalent of Balaam, but this is by no means certain. Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria write as if the sect of Nicolaitans existed in their day. A common belief was that their founder was Nicolaus of Antioch, one of the seven deacons. Irenaeus (1:26), followed by Hippolytus ('Refut.,' 7:24), supports this view; Ignatius ('Trall.,' 9) and the Apostolic Constitutions (6:8), are against it. The Nicolaitans may have claimed him as their founder, or similarity of name may have caused confusion with a different person. The doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and that of Balaam (ver. 14), and that of the woman Jezebel (ver. 20), seem to have this much in common - a contention that the freedom of the Christian placed him above the moral Law. Neither idolatry nor sensuality could harm those who had been made free by Christ. The moral enactments of the Law had been abrogated by the gospel, no less than the ceremonial. The special mention of "the pollutions of idols" and "fornication," in the decrees of the Council of Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>), seems to show that this pernicious doctrine was already in existence in A.D. . In <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2</a> and <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7-13</a> a similar evil is denounced. It appears in other heretical sects, especially those of Gnostic origin, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Cerinthians, Cainites, Carpocratians. In this way we may explain the statement of Eusebius ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:29), that the Nieelaitan heresy lasted only for a short time; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its religious libertinism did not die out, but passed over into other sects. Note that it is "the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Nicolaitans," not the men themselves, that Christ hates. He loves the sinner, while he hates the sin. "It would have been well with the Church had this always been remembered" (Alford). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
