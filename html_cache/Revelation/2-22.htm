The "bed of sickness" symbolizes both literal and metaphorical consequences. In biblical times, a bed often represented a place of rest or intimacy, but here it is transformed into a place of suffering. This reflects the seriousness of her sin and the resulting punishment. The imagery connects to the Old Testament, where God often used physical ailments as a form of judgment (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). The use of "behold" emphasizes the certainty and imminence of this judgment.<p><b>and those who commit adultery with her</b><br>This phrase refers to those who have been led astray by Jezebel's teachings and practices. In a spiritual sense, adultery often symbolizes idolatry and unfaithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>). The church in Thyatira is being warned about the dangers of compromising with pagan practices and false teachings. Historically, Thyatira was known for its trade guilds, which often involved pagan rituals. The believers are being cautioned against participating in these practices, which are akin to spiritual infidelity.<p><b>will suffer great tribulation</b><br>The "great tribulation" signifies severe trials and distress as a consequence of their actions. This is not the eschatological tribulation described elsewhere in Revelation but a specific judgment on those who follow Jezebel's ways. The severity of the tribulation underscores the seriousness of their sin and serves as a call to repentance. This aligns with the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><b>unless they repent of her deeds</b><br>Repentance is presented as the only means of escaping the impending judgment. This highlights God's mercy and willingness to forgive those who turn away from sin. The call to repent of "her deeds" indicates that the followers are not only guilty by association but have actively participated in her sinful actions. This echoes the broader biblical theme of repentance as a necessary step for restoration and reconciliation with God (e.g., <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>A symbolic reference to a false prophetess in the church of Thyatira, representing idolatry and immorality.

Forbearance having failed, God tries severity; and, as so often in his dealings with man, the instrument of wrong doing is made the instrument of punishment. The bed of sin becomes a bed of suffering. Compare "In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;" and "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord" (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is one of many words which has become weakened in meaning in late Greek: it often means no more than "place" or "put" (<a href="/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>; <a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>).

But perhaps we should rather compare such expressions as "cast into prison, into the sea, into the fire, into Gehenna" (<a href="/matthew/18-30.htm">Matthew 18:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a>).

Jezebel anticipates the harlot of <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, as Balaam anticipates the false prophet of <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. The remarkable construction, "repent <span class="accented">out of"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>), is peculiar to this book (vers. 21, 22; 9:20, 21; 16:11; but in <a href="/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, and in <a href="/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> (compare the converse, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>). <span class="accented">"Her</span> works" is to be preferred to "their works." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> might easily be changed to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, either accidentally, owing to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or deliberately, because it seems strange to talk of repenting from the works of another person. But the point is that those who have become partakers in her sins have abandoned their own works for hers; and it is therefore from her works that they are bidden to repent (compare "my works" in ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(Idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
