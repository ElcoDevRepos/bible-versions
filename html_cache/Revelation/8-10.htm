These judgments are a response to the prayers of the saints and signify divine intervention in human history. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology, suggesting the significance of this event in the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven</b><br>The imagery of a "great star" falling from heaven is symbolic and can represent a significant and catastrophic event. Stars in biblical literature often symbolize angels or celestial beings, as seen in <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>. The description of the star "burning like a torch" suggests a dramatic and fiery descent, indicating judgment or destruction. This imagery is reminiscent of the fall of Lucifer, described as a "morning star" in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>, and may symbolize a fallen angel or a divine messenger executing judgment.<p><b>and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water</b><br>The impact on "a third of the rivers and on the springs of water" indicates a partial but significant judgment affecting the earth's freshwater sources. Water is essential for life, and its contamination or destruction would have dire consequences for humanity. The fraction "a third" is consistent with other judgments in Revelation, emphasizing the severity yet restraint of God's wrath. This event echoes the plagues of Egypt, where water was turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>), and serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/third_angel.htm">Third Angel</a></b><br>One of the seven angels who sound the trumpets, each bringing a specific judgment upon the earth.

The advancing progress of Christianity is to be marked by many such a fall. The rulers of earth, burning with lust of conquest or with pride of fanaticism, will be plucked from their seat among the stars (<a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm" title="Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, there will I bring you down, said the LORD.">Obadiah 1:4</a>); but their fall is accompanied, as in the last instance, with miseries.

In <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a> the falling of stars is part of the general picture of the coming of the judgment day. The description here may therefore symbolize an act of judgment - one more of the troubles inflicted by God upon the guilty world. The frequent use of the symbol, <span class="accented">star</span>, as a type of one in an exalted position, has led most commentators to interpret the star of individual rulers, especially of those who poisoned the waters of Divine truth by heresy. But it seems more likely that the event here portrayed carries one step further the description of God's vengeance on the wicked, which has been already partially set forth. At first vegetation, then the sea, now the land waters, are smitten. The star, as the means employed by God, is typical of the awe striking nature of the punishment, and is indicative of the fact that the judgment is the act of God, and proceeds directly from heaven, and is not to be attributed to merely natural circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">And it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.</span> Not upon a third part of the fountains, but upon all fountains, just as in ver. 7 "all green grass" is visited with the plague. As stated above, another part of creation (and therefore another portion, of mankind) is afflicted. It is, of course, Impossible to point out the complete fulfilment of this judgment, Which is yet being fulfilled, but we may mention as illustrations the trouble caused to man by means of land waters, by floods, by drought, by pestilence. As before, only <span class="accented">part</span> suffers from this visitation; the greater part is spared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
