The act of deceiving the nations highlights Satan's primary method of leading people astray, consistent with his role as the "father of lies" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The nations here represent the peoples of the earth who have not fully embraced Christ's rule during the millennium. This deception echoes the serpent's deception of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, illustrating a recurring theme of Satan's influence throughout biblical history.<p><b>in the four corners of the earth</b><br>This expression signifies the entirety of the earth, indicating that Satan's deception will be widespread and global. The phrase "four corners" is a figurative way to describe the whole world, similar to the use of "four winds" in other biblical passages (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). It emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the final rebellion against God, involving people from all over the world.<p><b>Gog and Magog</b><br>Gog and Magog are symbolic names drawn from <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a>, where they represent forces opposed to God's people. In Ezekiel, Gog is a leader from the land of Magog, and they are depicted as enemies of Israel. In Revelation, these names symbolize the ultimate enemies of God's kingdom, representing the collective opposition to Christ's reign. The use of these names connects the prophecy in Ezekiel with the eschatological battle described in Revelation, suggesting a typological fulfillment of the earlier prophecy.<p><b>to assemble them for battle</b><br>This phrase indicates the gathering of forces for a final confrontation against God. The assembly for battle is a recurring motif in apocalyptic literature, symbolizing the ultimate showdown between good and evil. This battle is not just a physical conflict but a spiritual one, reflecting the cosmic struggle between God's kingdom and the forces of darkness. It parallels the battle of Armageddon mentioned in <a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>, where the kings of the earth are gathered for the great day of God Almighty.<p><b>Their number is like the sand of the seashore</b><br>This simile emphasizes the vast number of people who will be deceived and join in the rebellion against God. The imagery of "sand of the seashore" is used elsewhere in Scripture to denote an innumerable multitude, such as God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). Here, it underscores the overwhelming size of the opposition, yet it also serves to highlight the futility of their efforts against the omnipotent God. Despite their numbers, they are ultimately defeated, demonstrating God's sovereignty and the certainty of His victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The deceiver who is released to lead the nations astray.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_in_the_four_corners_of_the_earth.htm">Nations in the Four Corners of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of the entirety of the world, indicating a global scope of deception.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog_and_magog.htm">Gog and Magog</a></b><br>Symbolic names representing the enemies of God, drawing from Old Testament imagery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The final confrontation between the forces of evil and God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sand_of_the_seashore.htm">Sand of the Seashore</a></b><br>A metaphor for an innumerable multitude, emphasizing the vast number of those deceived.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_deception.htm">The Reality of Deception</a></b><br>Satan's primary tool is deception, and believers must be vigilant and discerning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_scope_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">Global Scope of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The battle is not localized but involves the entire world, reminding us of the universal nature of spiritual conflict.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_gog_and_magog.htm">Symbolism of Gog and Magog</a></b><br>These names symbolize the perennial enemies of God, reminding us that opposition to God has historical and spiritual roots.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_finality_of_god's_victory.htm">The Finality of God's Victory</a></b><br>Despite the vast number of those deceived, God's victory is assured, offering hope and assurance to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_faithfulness.htm">Call to Faithfulness</a></b><br>In light of the coming deception, believers are called to remain faithful and grounded in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_20_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_deception_like_Gog_Magog.htm">How can we guard against deception like "Gog and Magog" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_20_8_on_spiritual_warfare.htm">What does Revelation 20:8 teach about the nature of spiritual warfare?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38-39_link_to_Rev_20_8_s_Gog_Magog.htm">How does Ezekiel 38-39 connect with Revelation 20:8's mention of "Gog and Magog"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_Revelation_20_8.htm">In what ways can we prepare for the end times described in Revelation 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Rev_20_8_on_daily_Christian_life.htm">How does understanding Revelation 20:8 influence our daily walk with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Gog_and_Magog_s_role_in_Revelation_20_8.htm">What is the significance of Gog and Magog in Revelation 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_20_8_s_link_to_final_battle.htm">How does Revelation 20:8 relate to the final battle between good and evil?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_nations_misled_in_Rev_20_8.htm">Why are the nations deceived in Revelation 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_gog_and_magog_battle.htm">What is the battle involving Gog and Magog?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_no_precedent_for_ezekiel_38's_attack.htm">If Ezekiel 38 describes events yet to come, why is there no clear archaeological or historical precedent for such a massive, unified attack on Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_the_bible_say_earth_has_corners.htm">Why does the Bible state that the Earth has "four corners" if it's a sphere?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_ezekiel_38_5-6_align_with_other_prophecies.htm">How does the prophecy of a coalition of nations in Ezekiel 38:5&#8211;6 align or conflict with other biblical prophecies of end-time alliances?

The nations deceived and led astray are designated as Gog and Magog. The names are derived from Ezekiel (Ezekiel 38, 39). In rabbinical books the names were used to describe the nations who would rise against the reign of the Messiah. The names are to be understood figuratively. No particular nation could be well spoken of as "the nations in the four corners of the earth." The origin of the figure is not difficult. In Ezekiel, Gog is called the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; or, adopting another rendering, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Magog is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm" title="The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.">Genesis 10:2</a> as one of the sons of Japheth. The name is there associated with Gomer, Madai, and Meshech. Gomer is thought to correspond with the Cimmerians, Madai with the Medes, and Meshech with the Muscovites. Mr. Smith, in his history of Assurbanipal from cuneiform inscriptions, thinks that a certain chief of the Saka (Scythians), named Gaagi, is the same as Gog. The sons of this Gaagi are mentioned in connection with Birighudri, a chief of Madai (Medes). Josephus also identifies Magog with the Scythians. The remembrance of the Scythian invasion lingered long in the minds of Asiatic nations; and the names of those northern nations were adopted as representative of the great and undefined enemies who would in after ages assail the Messiah's kingdom, or wage unprovoked war against the true Israel of God. Ezekiel's language in <a href="/ezekiel/38-17.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring you against them?">Ezekiel 38:17</a> seems to imply as much. The Evangelist here accepts the names employed by the earlier prophet. Gog and Magog stand for the great hosts of the nations, and their leaders, who would break forth into uncalled-for hostility against the people of the Lord. It must be remembered that the imagery is derived from the history of Israel. Jerusalem, the beloved city of the true Israel of God, looks out upon her foes. They are Babylon, Egypt, or they may come from the far northern regions, the abode of Gog and Magog, whence the wild and relentless invaders had poured upon the land. Gog and Magog are thus used as typical names. Under the auspices of such, the great gathering of turbulent and reckless enemies of the faith would take place. The hosts of the foes of Jerusalem are described as innumerable as the sand of the sea. This great concourse of countless hosts is moved by hostility to the faith of Christ. The nations, thus multitudinous, have been restrained during the millennial reign. Evil and unbelief have been held in check, but they have not been extinguished. The millennial reign is clearly, therefore, not a period in which the rule of Christ is universally and sincerely accepted. There are powers at work which compete for human affections and interests; but the general acceptance of Christian principles keeps the evil forces in abeyance, and the gracious strength of God limits the power of the archenemy. But when the restraints are removed, the long-suppressed evil breaks forth, and the reluctantly submissive nations are gathered together to <span class= "ital">the war</span>--not to battle, as in our version, but to the war--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the war which has been before spoken of in Revelation 16, 19. All the restraints which Christ and Christian teaching had supplied to the world are gradually removed. The Euphrates is dried, the Devil is loosed, the unclean spirits have gone forth, the last phase of the long war between good and evil, between Christ and Belial, has been entered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog;</span> <span class="accented">four corners.</span> The signification of "Gog and Magog" (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) shows in what sense "the nations" is used. It is in the limited sense of the ungodly of the world, not in the wider sense in which the expression is used (without any qualifying clause) in ver. 3. <span class="accented">Magog</span> in <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> is mentioned among the sons of Japheth who were the ancestors of the northern nations (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a> and Ezekiel 39:2). Hence the name <span class="accented">Magog</span> is used to denote the northern tribes, whose invasion of Palestine and adjoining parts took place about <span class="date">B.C. 630-600</span>. From <a href="/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>, it seems that Gog was originally a leader among these tribes; and from <a href="/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a> it seems that Ezekiel took these names to be symbolical of all the foes of the people of God. Jewish tradition makes use of these names to indicate those nations who were expected to war against Jerusalem in the last days, and to be overthrown by the Messiah. Hence the employment of the terms here by St. John as denoting the ungodly people of the world, amongst whom Satan still exercises his power, though that power is limited to these, and he is completely bound as regards true believers. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea;</span> <span class="accented">to the war</span>; the article points definitely to the war of <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a> and Revelation 16:14. It is a prolonged <span class="accented">war</span>, not a <span class="accented">battle</span>, because lasting throughout life. The vastness of the hosts of Gog and Magog is alluded to in <a href="/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9, 16</a>. This is in conformity with our Lord's teaching: "Many are called, but few are chosen" (<a href="/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>; cf. also Revelation 7:14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">will go out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(exeleusetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
