The imagery of bowls being poured out is reminiscent of the Old Testament plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12), symbolizing God's wrath and judgment. The act of pouring out signifies the completeness and finality of God's judgment. The earth, as the target, indicates a global impact, affecting all humanity and creation, similar to the universal scope of the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>.<p><b>and loathsome, malignant sores broke out</b><br>The sores are reminiscent of the sixth plague of Egypt, where boils afflicted the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>). These sores are described as "loathsome" and "malignant," indicating their painful and incurable nature. In a biblical context, physical afflictions often symbolize spiritual corruption or divine punishment. The severity of these sores underscores the seriousness of God's judgment against sin and rebellion.<p><b>on those who had the mark of the beast</b><br>The mark of the beast is a symbol of allegiance to the Antichrist, as described earlier in <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16-17</a>. It represents a conscious decision to reject God and align with the forces of evil. The mark is often interpreted as a literal or symbolic identifier that distinguishes those who follow the beast from those who remain faithful to God. The judgment specifically targets those who have chosen to bear this mark, highlighting the consequences of their allegiance.<p><b>and worshiped its image</b><br>Worshiping the image of the beast signifies idolatry and the ultimate rejection of God. This act of worship is a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), which prohibit the worship of other gods and the making of idols. The image of the beast is a counterfeit to the true worship of God, and those who participate in this idolatry face divine retribution.

The &#8220;first angel&#8221; acts at God&#8217;s exact timing, showing that history moves under His sovereign direction, just as He earlier directed the plagues of Egypt through Moses (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>). In the same way that the first trumpet judgment struck the earth (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>), this first bowl is aimed at the planet itself, underscoring that every realm&#8212;earth, sea, sky&#8212;is subject to the Creator (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and poured out his bowl on the earth</b><p>The imagery of &#8220;pouring&#8221; recalls God&#8217;s wrath being &#8220;poured out&#8221; in Old Testament prophecies against rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-33.htm">Ezekiel 20:33&#8211;34</a>). Here the bowl contains undiluted judgment (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>). Unlike earlier judgments that affected a fraction, this one is total in scope, signaling that time for repentance has passed (<a href="/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>). It is literal, visible, and unavoidable, emphasizing that God&#8217;s wrath is as real as His mercy (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and loathsome, malignant sores broke out</b><p>The plague resembles the sixth Egyptian plague (<a href="/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8&#8211;12</a>) and anticipates <a href="/zechariah/14-12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>, where flesh and eyes rot in the Day of the LORD. &#8220;Loathsome, malignant&#8221; highlights both the physical agony and the moral hideousness of sin&#8217;s fruit (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>). These sores are not symbolic inner guilt; they are tangible, painful ulcers that testify to a literal fulfillment of God&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on those who had the mark of the beast</b><p>Only people who consciously received the mark (<a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16&#8211;17</a>) are struck. God distinguishes between the sealed servants (<a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2&#8211;3</a>) and the marked rebels, just as He spared Israel in Goshen while judging Egypt (<a href="/exodus/8-22.htm">Exodus 8:22&#8211;23</a>). The mark signified allegiance; now it becomes a brand of judgment, proving that every choice has eternal consequences (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and worshiped its image</b><p>The judgment targets not mere economic participation but heart-level idolatry (<a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14&#8211;15</a>). Worship of the beast is the ultimate rejection of the true God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>). By linking worship and sores, the text shows that idolatry always brings ruin (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1&#8211;2</a>). God vindicates His holiness by revealing the ugliness of false worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The first bowl demonstrates that God&#8217;s wrath is personal, precise, and proportional. Those who defiantly align with the beast experience immediate, bodily affliction, echoing past judgments and foreshadowing eternal punishment (<a href="/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9&#8211;11</a>). At the same time, God protects His own, underscoring the unbreakable link between allegiance to Christ and ultimate safety. <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a> challenges every reader to remain steadfast to the Lamb, knowing that what we worship today determines our destiny tomorrow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">the</span> <span class= "bld">first . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the first went forth, </span>&c.

The plague here described resembles the sixth of the Egyptian plagues, the plague of boils (comp. <a href="/context/exodus/9-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.">Exodus 9:8-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). Egypt is one type of the world-power; and the plagues are used as types also, and are not to be understood literally. The plague of the "evil sore" denotes some throbbing and hateful sore, perhaps spiritual or mental, which distracts attention and disturbs the personal serenity and self-complacency of the worshippers of the world-power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;</span> <span class="accented">his bowl into</span>, etc. (Revised Version). (On "vial," see on Revelation 5:8.) The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "into," distinguishes the first three vials from the last four, which have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," and some writers make this the basis for classifying the vials into groups of three and four; but it seems better to divide into groups of four and three (see on ver. 1, and preliminary remarks on the trumpet visions). And there fell; <span class="accented">and it became</span> (Revised Version). Compare the phraseology of <a href="/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>. A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. The counterpart of the sixth plague of Egypt. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "sore," used here, is the same used in LXX., <a href="/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>. It is impossible to say with certainty what (if any) particular judgment upon the ungodly is intended to be signified by St. John in this plague. From amongst the numerous interpretations which have been given to illustrate this passage, we may mention that of Andreas, who sees in it a reference to the "ulcer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of conscience. Or it may be that the writer has in contemplation that bodily disease which is the inevitable outcome of sin, and which often afflicts men in this world as the direct result of their misdoings; though, of course, it cannot always be asserted to be a consequence of a man's own personal misdoings. (On the latter part of the verse, see on Revelation 13.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
