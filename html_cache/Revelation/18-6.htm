In biblical context, this is often seen as God's justice being executed. The "her" refers to Babylon, symbolizing a corrupt system or city that has led others into sin. This principle is echoed in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>, where Babylon is called to be repaid for her deeds. The idea of reaping what one sows is a consistent biblical theme, seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>.<p><b>pay her back double for what she has done;</b><br>The concept of "double" repayment signifies the severity of Babylon's sins and the completeness of her judgment. In the ancient Near Eastern context, double restitution was a legal principle for certain crimes, indicating a full and just recompense. This is seen in <a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>, where a thief must repay double. The doubling emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment against the wickedness and idolatry represented by Babylon.<p><b>mix her a double portion in her own cup.</b><br>The imagery of a "cup" often symbolizes God's wrath and judgment in the Bible. In <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, the cup is filled with foaming wine, representing divine wrath. The "double portion" again underscores the intensity and certainty of the judgment. The use of "her own cup" suggests that Babylon's punishment is a direct result of her own actions, reinforcing the idea of justice being served. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's ultimate victory over evil and the establishment of His righteous kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon_the_great.htm">Babylon the Great</a></b><br>Symbolic of a corrupt and idolatrous system, often interpreted as representing a powerful, worldly empire or institution that opposes God and His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup.htm">The Cup</a></b><br>Represents the judgment and wrath of God.
