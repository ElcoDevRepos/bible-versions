The term "Lord's day" is distinct from the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) and reflects the shift in worship practices among early Christians. This day became significant for gathering, worship, and breaking bread, as seen in <a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>.<p><b>I was in the Spirit</b><br>Being "in the Spirit" indicates a state of spiritual ecstasy or prophetic vision, where the Holy Spirit enables a deeper level of revelation.

By calling it &#8220;the Lord&#8217;s day,&#8221; John ties his vision to that weekly celebration of resurrection life and worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>).

God initiates; John simply yields.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I heard behind me</b><p>The voice comes from behind, reminding us that revelation is received, not manufactured. Isaiah wrote, &#8220;Your ears will hear this command behind you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>). Like a shepherd calling his sheep (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>), the Lord directs John&#8217;s attention. He must turn to see, anchoring the vision in time and space. God leads; the servant responds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a loud voice like a trumpet</b><p>The voice&#8217;s volume and tone match Old Testament scenes where God&#8217;s presence thundered:<p>&#8226; Sinai shook with &#8220;a very loud trumpet blast&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; At Christ&#8217;s return &#8220;the Lord Himself will descend&#8230; with the trumpet call of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; John later hears, &#8220;Come up here,&#8221; from a voice &#8220;like the sound of a trumpet&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>).<p>A trumpet cuts through every distraction, gathers people, and signals authority. In <a href="/bsb/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, the risen Christ speaks with that same commanding clarity, preparing to unveil messages for His churches (<a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>On a literal Sunday set aside for worship, John is overtaken by the Holy Spirit. God calls from behind with a trumpet-like voice, capturing John&#8217;s full attention. The verse shows Jesus taking the initiative, using a day already devoted to Him, empowering His servant by the Spirit, and speaking with unmistakable authority. Revelation begins in worship, proceeds by the Spirit, and centers on the living voice of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">I was</span> (or, <span class= "ital">I became</span>) <span class= "bld">in the Spirit.</span>--The mind, drawn onward by the contemplation of things spiritual, is abstracted from the immediate consciousness of outward earthly forms of life. In great natures this power is usually strong. Socrates is related to have stood rapt in thought for hours, and even days, unconscious of the midday heat, or the mocking wonder of his comrades. To high-souled men, set upon the spiritual welfare of the race, this power of detaching themselves from the influence of the outward is the result of their earnestness; the things spiritual are to them the real; the things seen are temporal. It is the Holy Spirit alone which can give the power of this spiritual abstraction; but it is through the ordinary use of means that this power is bestowed. In St. John's case it was on the Lord's Day that this spiritual rapture was vouchsafed.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord's day.</span>--There is no ground whatever for the futurist interpretation that this expression refers to the "Day of the Lord," as in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>. The phrase in this latter passage is totally different. The phrase here is. <span class= "ital">en te kuriake hemera.</span> The adjective is applied by St. Paul (perhaps coined by him for the purpose) to the Lord's Supper: from the Supper it came to be applied to the day on which Christians met for the breaking of bread. The day is still called <span class= "greekheb">???????</span> (<span class= "ital">kuriake</span>) in the Levant. On the Lord's Day the vision came to the Apostle. It was the hour of sweetest, closest communion, when the memories of Christ risen, and the fellowship he had enjoyed at Ephesus, would work on his spirit, and aid in raising him in highest adoration, like St. Paul (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2-4</a>). When so rapt, he heard a voice, strong, clear, and resonant as a trumpet. The Apostle's voice could not be heard among his beloved flock at Ephesus; but there was a voice which would reach from the exile at Patmos, not to Ephesus and its sister churches, but to all churches and throughout all time. The mouth which persecution closes God opens, and bids it speak to the world. So St. Paul, through the Epistles of his Captivity, still speaks. Luther, by his translation of the Bible, spoke from his confinement at Wartburg; and Bunyan, by his divine allegory, shows how feeble were the walls of his cell at Bedford to silence the voice of God. If speech be silver and silence golden, it is also true in the history of the Church that from the captivity of her teachers she has received her most abiding treasures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was in the Spirit</span>.

This is, therefore, the earliest use of the phrase in this sense. That it means Easter Day or Pentecost is baseless conjecture. The phrase had not yet become common in A.D. , as is shown from St. Paul writing, "on the first of the week" (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>), the usual expression in the Gospels and Acts (<a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>; <a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>; <a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; comp. <a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). But from Ignatius onwards, we have a complete chain of evidence that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> became the regular Christian name for the first day of the week; and <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is still the name of Sunday in the Levant. "No longer observing sabbaths, but fashioning their lives after the Lord's day" (Ign., 'Magn.,' 9.). Melito, Bishop of Sardis (A.D. 170), wrote a treatise <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' IV. 26:2). Dionysius of Corinth (A.D. 175), in an epistle to the Romans, mentions that the Church of Corinth is that day keeping the Lord's holy day (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' IV. 23:11). Comp. also Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' VII. 12:98 (p. 377, Potter); Tertull., 'De Con.,' 3. and 'De Idol.,' 14, where <span class="accented">Dominicus dies</span> is obviously a translation of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; and fragment 7 of the lost works of Irenaeus. That "the Lord's day" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) in this place is the same as "the day of the Lord" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is not at all probable. The context is quite against any such meaning as that St. John is spiritually transported to the day of judgment. Contrast <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>; <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39, 40, 44, 54</a>; <a href="/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24</a>; <a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>. Whereas, seeing that the visions which follow are grouped in sevens (the seven candlesticks, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials), the fact that they begin on the first day of the seven is eminently appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Great voice</span>. The voice is evidently Christ's; but throughout the Apocalypse the speaker is frequently not named. By a construction common in Hebrew, "saying" agrees with "trumpet," the nearest substantive, instead of with "voice" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).
