It signifies God's majesty, power, and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence. The throne represents God's sovereign rule, and the accompanying phenomena emphasize His authority and the seriousness of His judgments. In biblical literature, such manifestations often precede significant divine actions or revelations, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>) and the visions of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>). The use of these elements in Revelation underscores the continuity of God's revelation and His unchanging nature.<p><b>Before the throne burned seven torches of fire.</b><br>The seven torches symbolize completeness and perfection, often associated with God's Spirit. In the ancient world, torches were used for illumination and guidance, suggesting the enlightening and purifying work of the Holy Spirit. The number seven is significant throughout Scripture, representing fullness and divine perfection, as seen in the seven days of creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and the seven churches addressed earlier in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). The presence of fire also indicates judgment and purification, aligning with the refining work of the Spirit in believers' lives (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>These are the seven spirits of God.</b><br>This phrase refers to the fullness of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which describes the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah with attributes such as wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. The seven spirits are not separate entities but rather a symbolic representation of the Holy Spirit's complete and perfect work. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2-6</a>, where the prophet sees a vision of a lampstand with seven lamps, symbolizing God's Spirit empowering His people. The presence of the seven spirits before the throne highlights the Spirit's role in executing God's will and empowering the church to fulfill its mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>Represents the sovereign authority and majesty of God.

The sights and sounds are not mere theatrics; they signal God&#8217;s awesome, holy presence and His readiness to act.<p>&#8226; The same trio of lightning, rumblings, and thunder accompanied the giving of the Law at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; 20:18). Just as Israel trembled, creation itself now quakes before the enthroned Lord.<p>&#8226; In Ezekiel&#8217;s inaugural vision the prophet saw &#8220;fire flashing back and forth&#8221; around God&#8217;s throne-chariot (<a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>). John&#8217;s scene matches and heightens Ezekiel&#8217;s, reminding us that the God of the prophets is unchanged.<p>&#8226; Later in Revelation the storm imagery reappears whenever God&#8217;s judgments intensify (<a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; 11:19; 16:18). The pattern teaches that what John hears is an advance notice of coming justice.<p>&#8226; Practically, for believers this portrays a Father powerful enough to defend and vindicate His people, yet so holy that He must be approached with reverent fear (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the throne burned seven torches of fire</b><p>John sees literal, blazing lamps. They are stationed &#8220;before&#8221; the throne, indicating ministry in God&#8217;s immediate presence.<p>&#8226; The sight recalls the seven-branched lampstand that stood before the veil in the earthly tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>). That menorah pointed forward to this heavenly original.<p>&#8226; Zechariah&#8217;s night visions featured a golden lampstand and two olive trees, symbolizing God&#8217;s Spirit empowering His work (<a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2-6</a>). John&#8217;s vision shows the ultimate fulfillment&#8212;unending divine light.<p>&#8226; The Lord Jesus walks among seven lampstands representing the churches (<a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>). Here, however, the torches stand in heaven. Earthly congregations shine only because the heavenly lamps blaze first.<p>&#8226; The intensity of fire communicates purity (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>) and discernment (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). Nothing unclean survives before this throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These are the seven spirits of God</b><p>John immediately interprets the torches: they are &#8220;the seven spirits of God.&#8221; Scripture consistently identifies this phrase with the Holy Spirit&#8217;s sevenfold fullness, not seven separate beings.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4 and 3</a>:1 link &#8220;the seven spirits&#8221; with both Father and Son, proving they belong to the one divine essence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> pictures the Lamb having &#8220;seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth,&#8221; showing the Spirit&#8217;s omniscient, world-ranging ministry.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> outlines the Spirit&#8217;s complete attributes&#8212;wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, fear of the Lord, and the Spirit of the Lord Himself&#8212;seven qualities that match the symbolism.<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s position &#8220;before the throne&#8221; affirms His eternal procession from the Father and His role in mediating God&#8217;s presence to creation (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>; 15:26).<p>&#8226; For believers, this means the same Spirit who empowers the churches is eternally ablaze before God, guaranteeing our prayers reach the throne and His power reaches us (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a> unveils the throne room just as it is: awe-inspiring storms announce God&#8217;s holiness and coming judgment; seven fiery torches illuminate His majesty and purity; and those torches are the Holy Spirit in His sevenfold fullness. The verse assures us that the God we serve is both infinitely powerful and intimately present, ready to judge wickedness and to empower His people with the blazing light of His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And out of the throne proceeded </span>(rather, <span class= "ital">proceed;</span> there is a change in the tense used) <span class= "bld">lightnings and thunderings and voices.--</span>These are viewed by some as the indications of approaching judgments. Perhaps it is better to view them as the tokens of God's power of judgment than as hints of immediately approaching judgments. The scene at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>) was no doubt in the prophet's mind. There the clouds and lightnings were not so much tokens of coming judgment as the symbols of that righteous power which can show itself in judgment. "Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne" (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a>). They are the constant tokens of that power of God<p>"Which makes the darkness and the light,<p>And dwells not in the light alone,<p>But in the darkness and the cloud<p>As over Sinai's peaks of old."<p><span class= "bld">And there were seven lamps </span>(or, <span class= "ital">torches)</span> of <span class= "bld">fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.--</span>See <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>. The Spirit of God in His manifold powers is thus described under emblems of fire. Not merely as a fire of judgment. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a baptism of fire (<a href="/context/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11-12</a>). The flaming presence purges the spirit from sin. The Holy Spirit consumes evil. It is an unquenchable fire against all evils, whether in men's hearts or in men's lives, or in the world. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a>.) May there not be allusion to the covenant with Abraham, which was ratified by fire? Lamps, or torches, of fire <span class= "ital">(lampades puros</span>, LXX., same as in this passage) went between the divided pieces of the heifer and the she-goat. If this be correct, the vision of this chapter reminds us that God is ever mindful of His covenant. The rainbow, the token of the covenant with Noah; the flaming torches, tokens of the covenant with Abraham; and the thunderings and lightnings, the tokens of the covenant at Sinai, are ever with Him. (Comp, also <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thundering and voices.
