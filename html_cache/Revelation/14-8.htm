In the context of Revelation, angels often serve as messengers of God's will and judgment. The sequential nature of the angels in <a href="/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a> suggests a structured and deliberate unfolding of God's plan.

Babylon, historically a powerful empire and a symbol of human pride and idolatry, represents the epitome of worldly opposition to God. In the prophetic literature, Babylon often symbolizes the ultimate enemy of God's people. This phrase echoes Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a>, which also declares the fall of Babylon. The term "the great" underscores Babylon's perceived power and influence, which makes its fall even more significant.<p><b>who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality.&#8221;</b><br>This imagery of making nations drink wine suggests the pervasive and intoxicating influence of Babylon's immorality. The "wine of the passion" indicates a seductive and destructive force that leads nations into spiritual adultery and idolatry. The metaphor of drinking wine is used throughout Scripture to describe participation in sin and judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>). The immorality here is not just sexual but encompasses all forms of idolatry and rebellion against God.

Better, <span class= "ital">And another, a second, angel followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has given all the nations to drink of, </span>&c. The second angel follows on the first: the doom of the world-city, the metropolis of the empire of the world-power, follows the proclamation of the gospel. The principles of Christ's gospel must undermine the world-power; the fall of some Babylon principle has almost always succeeded the age of spiritual revival. Pagan Rome goes down before the gospel. Civil freedom follows the wake of religious freedom, for Babylon belongs not to one age. Pagan Rome was Babylon to St. John; papal Rome was often Babylon to a later age. Dante, Savanarola, Tauler, Luther, felt her to be so in the days when their eyes were enlightened; but Babylon was not on the Euphrates alone: she has reared palaces on the Seine, and on the Thames, Tiber, and on the Bosphorus. She may yet erect her power in more imposing form; but faith in that gospel which is the power of God, will cast her down along with everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God. The influence of Babylon is declared in this: that she has given all nations to drink of deadly wine--the wine alike of her sin and of her doom, of her fornication and of the wrath which will overtake it. Babylon, then, is clearly an emblem of some principles which have been more or less accepted by all nations, and which will more or less involve all in the consequences of her fall. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>, where the features of this Babylon are more fully developed.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there followed another angel, saying;</span> <span class="accented">and another, a second angel, followed.</span> That is, of course, the second of the three who here make their appearance in close connection.

Omit "city." <span class="accented">Babylon</span> is the type of the world power. Like so much of the Apocalypse, the image is supplied by the Book of Daniel. There the kingdom is spoken of as <span class="accented">great</span> (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>; cf. also <a href="/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>.). In its oppression of the Jewish nation, Babylon is a type of the world power which persecutes the Church of God. At the time when St. John wrote, this power was preeminently possessed and wielded by Rome, and that empire may thus be intended as the immediate antitype of Babylon. But the description is also applicable to the persecuting power of the world in all ages, and its denial of and opposition to God. Babylon is representative of the world, as Jerusalem is of the true Church of God. Alford observes, "Two things are mingled: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wine of her fornication, of which all nations have drunk (<a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>); and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wine of the wrath of God, which he shall give her to drink (ver. 10 and <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>). The latter is the retribution for the former; the former turns into the latter; they are treated as one and the same." The description seems taken from <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7, 8</a>, "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed."
