In biblical literature, signs often point to deeper spiritual truths or forthcoming events. The setting in heaven suggests a perspective beyond earthly limitations, emphasizing the importance and divine origin of the vision. This aligns with other biblical instances where signs in heaven indicate God's intervention or messages, such as in <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>.<p><b>A woman clothed in the sun:</b><br>The woman symbolizes a figure of great importance and purity, often interpreted as representing Israel, the Church, or Mary, the mother of Jesus. Being "clothed in the sun" suggests glory, righteousness, and divine favor. This imagery echoes Joseph's dream in <a href="/genesis/37-9.htm">Genesis 37:9</a>, where celestial bodies represent Jacob's family, linking the woman to the people of God. The sun's brilliance signifies God's presence and protection, as seen in <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>.<p><b>With the moon under her feet:</b><br>The moon under her feet may symbolize dominion and victory over changeable and temporal things, as the moon often represents the passage of time and earthly cycles. This imagery reinforces the woman's exalted status and authority. In biblical symbolism, the moon can also represent reflection of the sun's light, suggesting the woman's role in reflecting divine glory.<p><b>And a crown of twelve stars on her head:</b><br>The crown signifies victory, authority, and honor. The twelve stars are commonly interpreted as representing the twelve tribes of Israel or the twelve apostles, symbolizing the people of God. This connection to the number twelve underscores completeness and divine governance, as seen throughout Scripture in contexts like the twelve tribes (Genesis 49) and the twelve apostles (<a href="/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2-4</a>). The crown also points to the fulfillment of God's promises to His people, highlighting themes of redemption and covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's people, often interpreted as Israel or the Church.

It is doubtful whether any particular signification is to be attached to the expression, though Wordsworth notes concerning the Church, "For her origin is from above; hers is the kingdom of heaven." And Bengel, "The woman, the Church, though on earth, is nevertheless, by virtue of her union with Christ, in heaven." <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> The <span class="accented">woman</span> is undoubtedly the Church of God; not necessarily limited to the Christian Church, but the whole company of all who acknowledge God, including the heavenly beings in existence before the creation, as well as creation itself. The figure is found both in the Old Testament and in the New. Thus <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5, 6</a>, "For thy Maker is thine Husband .... For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved" (cf. also <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with the sun.</span> The whole description is intended to portray the glory and beauty of the Church. Most of the ancient commentators give particular interpretations of the symbols employed. Thus the <span class="accented">sun</span> is believed to represent Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. Primasius quotes <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." <span class="cmt_word">And the moon under her feet.</span> This is interpreted as showing the permanent nature of the Church; she treads underfoot the moon, the symbol of changing times and seasons. It is thought that a reference is thus intended to the futility of the endeavours made to subvert the Church (cf. <a href="/songs/6-10.htm">Song of Solomon 6:10</a>). Others variously interpret the <span class="accented">moon</span> of <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Mosaic Law; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the irreligion of the world; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Mohammedan power.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a great</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(mega)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">Large, great, in the widest sense. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">sign</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#275;meion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4592.htm">Strong's 4592: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of a presumed derivative of the base of semaino; an indication, especially ceremonially or supernaturally.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">appeared</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8036;&#966;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(&#333;phth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
