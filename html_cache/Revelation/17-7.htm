In biblical literature, angels often serve as messengers or interpreters of divine visions (<a href="/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15-17</a>). John's amazement may reflect the shocking nature of the vision, which reveals the spiritual realities behind earthly powers. The angel's role here is to guide John to a deeper understanding, emphasizing that the vision is not meant to confuse but to reveal truth.<p><b>&#8220;I will tell you the mystery of the woman</b><br>The "woman" in this context is symbolic, often interpreted as representing a corrupt system or city, traditionally identified with Babylon. In biblical symbolism, women can represent cities or nations (<a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The term "mystery" suggests a hidden truth that requires divine revelation to be understood, a common theme in apocalyptic literature (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>).<p><b>and of the beast that carries her,</b><br>The "beast" is a recurring symbol in Revelation, representing oppressive political powers or empires (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-7</a>). The imagery of the beast carrying the woman suggests a relationship where the political power supports and upholds the corrupt system. This reflects the historical context of the Roman Empire, which many early Christians saw as embodying such a beastly power.<p><b>which has the seven heads and ten horns.</b><br>The "seven heads" and "ten horns" are symbolic features that appear elsewhere in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). The seven heads are often interpreted as seven hills, alluding to Rome, known as the city on seven hills, or as seven kings or kingdoms (<a href="/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9-10</a>). The ten horns are typically seen as ten kings or rulers who will align with the beast (<a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>). This imagery connects to the prophetic visions in Daniel, where beasts with multiple heads and horns represent successive empires and rulers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who provides John with insight and understanding about the vision he is witnessing.

The woman, the wilderness, the reliance upon the world power, the inscription, the similar description of Judah in <a href="/jeremiah/2.htm">Jeremiah 2</a> and 3.
