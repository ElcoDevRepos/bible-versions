It emphasizes the seriousness and urgency of the message being delivered, underscoring the divine authority behind the unfolding events.<p><b>&#8220;Come!&#8221;</b><br>The command "Come!" is an invitation or summons, possibly directed towards the rider of the first horse, signaling the commencement of the events that follow.

It also echoes the call to witness the fulfillment of God's purposes, as seen in other prophetic contexts like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, symbolizing His sacrificial role and authority to execute God's plan.

He is still in heaven, looking on as events unfold in real time, just as he earlier &#8220;saw&#8221; the throne (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>) and the scroll (<a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>). That repeated eyewitness wording underscores the plain-sense, chronological flow of the prophecy&#8212;just as Daniel &#8220;watched&#8221; successive beasts rise (<a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2-4</a>). Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we can take John&#8217;s watching as a genuine preview of history about to break into time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals</b><p>The Lamb is Jesus, freshly presented in <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6-9</a> as the only One worthy to break the seals. By opening the first seal, He launches the series of judgments that will run all the way to His visible return (compare <a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-31</a>, where Jesus Himself outlined parallel stages). Seven seals mean a complete, divinely determined sequence. The moment the Lamb acts, the end-time clock starts ticking&#8212;no power on earth or in heaven can pause it (<a href="/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I heard one of the four living creatures say</b><p>These living creatures stand closest to God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>), reflecting His holiness and authority much like the cherubim Ezekiel saw (<a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-10</a>). Their participation signals that the coming judgments arise from God&#8217;s own character, not random chaos. Because one of them speaks, heaven itself authorizes what is about to ride forth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in a voice like thunder</b><p>Thunder in the Bible often marks God&#8217;s awe-inspiring presence and decisive action (<a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>; <a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28-29</a>). The thunder-like voice announces that what follows is unstoppable and serious. Every listener&#8212;angelic or human&#8212;must pay attention because almighty authority backs the command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come!</b><p>With that single word, the first horseman is summoned (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). &#8220;Come&#8221; does not invite John but calls forth the rider who represents conquering power&#8212;foreshadowed in <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-8</a> and matching Jesus&#8217; warning of global deception and conflict (<a href="/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5-7</a>).

A throne-room cherub speaks with thunderous authority, summoning the first horseman. Every detail affirms that the coming judgments flow directly from the Lamb&#8217;s sovereign hand, unfold in God-ordained order, and signal that history is moving, by divine decree, toward the triumphant return of the King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And </span>I <span class= "bld">saw when the Lamb </span>(the diminutive form of Lamb is still used) . . .--The words "and see" are doubtful. They are found in some MSS. and omitted in others: the authority for their omission and for their retention is about equally divided. Under these circumstances we may fairly be guided by the context. To whom is the summons addressed? Who is bidden to come? If it was taken to be addressed to the seer, we can understand why some copyist should add the words "and see." But are they addressed to the seer? It seems difficult to see the purpose of such a command. He was near already. He had seen the Lamb opening the seal. There was no object in his drawing near. Are the words, then, addressed, as Alford supposes, to Christ? It is difficult to believe that the living creature would thus cry to the Lamb, who was opening the scroll. The simplest way of answering the question is to ask another: Who did come in obedience to the voice? There is but one answer--the horseman. The living beings cry "Come," and their cry is responded to by the appearance of the several riders. What is the spiritual meaning of this? The living beings represent, as we have seen, animated nature--that nature and creation of God which groans and travails in pain, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. These summon the emblems of war and pestilence to come on the scene, for these things must needs be, and through these lies the way for the final coming of God's Christ, for whom creation longs. They bid the pains and troubles come, because they recognise them as the precursors of creation's true King. Thus their voice has in it an undertone which sighs for the advent of the Prince of Peace, who is <span class= "ital">to come.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw</span>. A new departure in the series of visions is marked (see on Revelation 4:1). We have here the commencement of the Revelation proper, to which the first five chapters have formed an introduction (cf. Tabular analysis). The vision of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, which, although related first, exhibits events concurrent with those symbolized by the <span class="accented">trumpets</span> and <span class="accented">vials</span>, is contained chiefly in <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a> is occupied with an account of an episodal character, similar to that which occurs in <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:14</a> after the sixth trumpet; and the vision is completed by the opening of the seventh seal, described in <a href="/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. The opening of the first seal pictures the triumph of Christ and his Church, for the comfort and hopeful assurance of those to whom St. John was writing, and for the edification of struggling Christians of all time. To this theme, touched upon here proleptically, the apostle returns at the conclusion of the <span class="accented">trumpets</span>; the first six of which bear a general likeness to the last six of the <span class="accented">seals.<span class="cmt_word"></span> When the Lamb opened one of the seals;</span> <span class="accented">one of the seven seals</span> (Revised Version). The insertion of "seven" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) is supported by A, B, C, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and others; Vulgate, De Dieu's Syriac, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, Victorinus, AEthiopic. (On the <span class="accented">right</span> of the Lamb to open the <span class="accented">seals</span>, see on Revelation 5.) <span class="cmt_word">And I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">the voice of thunder</span>... <span class="accented">four living creatures</span> (Revised Version). (For the <span class="accented">four living beings</span>, see on Revelation 4:6.) Here each living being invites attention to the revelation of the future of that creation of which they are all representative. The <span class="accented">thunder</span> is the usual accompaniment of a special revelation of the Divine will, and indicative of the majesty of him whose will is declared (see <a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a> and Revelation 14:2; also <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>). Nothing in the text warrants us in particularizing the four living creatures in these four invitations uttered by them, though many writers have endeavoured to do so. Thus, adopting the order in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, they have supposed that the first voice was uttered by the lion, since the revelation of the first seal is distinguished by the prophecy of victory. The sacrificial nature of the second living being - the steer - is thought to be connected with the slaughter predicted under the second seal by the vision of war and persecution. The man is considered typical of the heresy which it is believed the third seal predicts, and especially of the false opinions concerning the Incarnation; while the eagle is regarded as a symbol of resurrection and the harbinger of the final victory of the just over the death and Hades of the fourth seal. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Come and see.</span> The Revised Version omits "and see."

The authorities are thus very evenly balanced; but the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, even if not warranted, seems to indicate that the sentence was generally considered to be addressed to St. John; and was intended as an invitation to him to witness the appearances which accompanied the breaking of the seals. Alford contends that the cry, "Come," is addressed, on behalf of creation, to the Lord Jesus, and is a petition to him to speedily bring these things to pass, that his own advent may follow. In support of this, Alford remarks that there is no example of the use by St. John of <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the sense of "Come and see," "Come hither," without <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, or some qualifying particle; but, on the contrary, it is exactly the expression used of our Lord's advent in <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17, 20</a>, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come," etc. Though there is much reason in this contention, yet, on the whole, the weight of evidence, as stated above, makes it probable that the sentence is addressed to St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I watched</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
