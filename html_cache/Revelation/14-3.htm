In the Psalms, new songs are sung in response to God's mighty works (<a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3, 40</a>:3, 96:1). Here, the new song likely represents the unique experience and testimony of the 144,000, who have been preserved through tribulation. It signifies a new chapter in the unfolding of God's kingdom.<p><b>before the throne</b><br>The throne is a central image in Revelation, symbolizing God's sovereign rule and authority (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>). The presence of the new song before the throne indicates that this act of worship is directed towards God Himself, acknowledging His ultimate power and the fulfillment of His promises. It emphasizes the heavenly setting and the divine approval of the song.<p><b>and before the four living creatures and the elders</b><br>The four living creatures and the elders are introduced in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-10</a>. The living creatures, with their unique appearances, represent all of creation, while the elders symbolize the redeemed people of God, possibly the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. The song being sung in their presence suggests a universal acknowledgment of God's redemptive work, witnessed by both creation and the redeemed.<p><b>And no one could learn the song</b><br>This exclusivity highlights the unique relationship and experience of the 144,000. It suggests a level of spiritual insight and understanding granted only to them, possibly due to their faithfulness and purity (<a href="/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4-5</a>). This mirrors the idea that spiritual truths are often revealed to those who are spiritually prepared (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>except the 144,000</b><br>The 144,000 are first mentioned in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>, where they are described as being sealed from the twelve tribes of Israel. They are often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the faithful remnant of God's people, preserved through the tribulation. Their ability to learn the song underscores their special status and role in God's plan.<p><b>who had been redeemed from the earth</b><br>Redemption is a key theme in Christian theology, referring to the act of being saved from sin and its consequences through Christ's sacrifice. The phrase indicates that the 144,000 have been purchased or set apart by God, emphasizing their purity and dedication. This redemption from the earth suggests a separation from worldly values and a commitment to God's kingdom, aligning with the call to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_144,000.htm">The 144,000</a></b><br>This group is described as those who have been redeemed from the earth.

As heaven listens, creation is reminded that every promise of God stands firm, and every redeemed heart has its own song of deliverance waiting to be sung.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And they . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And they</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the heavenly harpers) <span class= "ital">sing a new song</span> (the words "as it were" ought, perhaps, to be omitted) <span class= "ital">before the throne, and before the living creatures, and the elders </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the presence of God Himself, and creation, and the Church), <span class= "ital">and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.</span> It is a heavenly song, and no spirit dulled by earthly desires can learn it. The Spirit of the Lord can open the dull ear to hear and to rejoice in the songs of God's saints. Amid the world-noises of Babylon men can neither hear nor sing aright the Lord's song (<a href="/psalms/137-4.htm" title="How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?">Psalm 137:4</a>); but the redeemed (the purchased from the earth) of the Lord can come with singing unto Zion (<a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm" title="Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.">Isaiah 51:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders.</span> <span class="accented">They sing</span>; that is to say, the heavenly inhabitants. <span class="accented">The four living beings</span>; viz. those of <a href="/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>, where see an explanation of the positions occupied, and of the nature and signification of the "living beings and the elders."
