It echoes the idea found in <a href="/daniel/12-10.htm">Daniel 12:10</a>, where the wicked will continue in their ways, unable to understand the truth. This is a call to recognize the permanence of one's spiritual state at the time of judgment. The unrighteous are those who have rejected God's offer of salvation and persist in their sinful ways. This phrase serves as a warning that there will come a time when change is no longer possible, emphasizing the urgency of repentance.<p><b>and the vile continue to be vile</b><br>The term "vile" refers to those who are morally corrupt and depraved. This phrase underscores the idea that those who have chosen a path of wickedness will remain in that state. It highlights the biblical principle that one's character becomes fixed at the time of judgment. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49-50</a>, where the wicked are separated from the righteous at the end of the age. The continuation of vileness signifies the eternal consequences of rejecting God's grace.<p><b>let the righteous continue to practice righteousness</b><br>In contrast to the unrighteous, the righteous are those who have accepted God's salvation and live according to His commandments. This phrase encourages believers to persevere in their faith and good works. It reflects the biblical theme of sanctification, where the righteous are called to grow in holiness and live out their faith. This is supported by passages such as 1 <a href="/john/3-7.htm">John 3:7</a>, which urges believers to practice righteousness as a reflection of their relationship with God. The continuation of righteousness signifies the eternal reward for those who remain faithful.<p><b>and the holy continue to be holy</b><br>The term "holy" refers to those who are set apart for God's purposes. This phrase emphasizes the call for believers to maintain their sanctity and dedication to God. Holiness is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, where believers are called to be holy as God is holy. This reflects the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, enabling them to live in a manner that honors God. The continuation of holiness signifies the eternal state of those who are in Christ, set apart for His glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unrighteous_and_the_vile.htm">The Unrighteous and the Vile</a></b><br>Represents those who reject God's commandments and live in sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_and_the_holy.htm">The Righteous and the Holy</a></b><br>Represents those who follow God's commandments and live a life set apart for Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_jerusalem.htm">The New Jerusalem</a></b><br>The ultimate destination for the righteous, described earlier in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_final_judgment.htm">The Final Judgment</a></b><br>The context of this verse, where eternal destinies are sealed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_finality_of_choices.htm">The Finality of Choices</a></b><br>This verse emphasizes the permanence of one's spiritual state at the time of judgment.

But what does the verse mean? Does it mean that the time is so short that it is hardly sufficient to allow of men reforming themselves, so as to be ready for their Lord, and that therefore the lesson is, let those who would be ready for Him remember that <span class= "ital">now</span> is the day of salvation? This is the view adopted by some: it contains a truth, but the meaning of the verse seems more general. Is it not the declaration of the ever terrible truth, that men are building up their destiny by the actions and habits of their lives? "Sow an act--reap a habit: sow a habit--reap a character: sow a character--reap a destiny." The righteous become righteous: the godly become godly.<p>"Thus, all characters<p>Must shrink or widen, as our wine-skins do,<p>For more or less that we can pass in them:<p>And added years give ever a new key<p>To fixed prediction."<p>So, slowly, but surely, may the power of being masters of our fate pass out of our hands. It is in this law of our nature that the key to many of the darkest problems of the future may lie; and not without a solemn declaration of this law does the Book of Revelation close.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still;</span> <span class="accented">he that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still, etc.</span> (Revised Version). These words seem to be used ironically, as was sometimes the case with the prophets (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-39.htm">Ezekiel 20:39</a>). The intention seems to be to stir men up to a realization of the nature of their conduct in continuing to reject the warnings of God. Note that the words immediately succeeding, as well as those immediately preceding, are connected with the judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/22-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Let} the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
