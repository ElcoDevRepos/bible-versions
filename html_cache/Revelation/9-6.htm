This is a time of intense suffering and judgment upon the earth, as described in the book of Revelation. The phrase "in those days" is used throughout the Bible to denote significant prophetic periods (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-29.htm">Joel 2:29-31</a>).<p><b>men will seek death</b><br>The suffering and torment during this period will be so severe that people will desire death as an escape. This reflects the intensity of the plagues and judgments described in Revelation, such as the locusts from the abyss (<a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3-5</a>). Historically, seeking death in times of extreme distress is not uncommon, as seen in <a href="/job/3-21.htm">Job 3:21</a>, where Job laments his suffering.<p><b>and will not find it</b><br>Despite their desire to die, death will elude them. This suggests a supernatural intervention where God prevents death, emphasizing the inescapable nature of divine judgment. It highlights the sovereignty of God over life and death, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>.<p><b>they will long to die</b><br>The longing for death underscores the hopelessness and despair that will characterize this period. It is a reversal of the natural human instinct to preserve life, indicating the severity of the tribulation. This longing is reminiscent of the despair expressed by figures like Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>.<p><b>but death will escape them</b><br>This phrase indicates that death, often seen as a release from suffering, will not be available. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate control God has over life and death, as well as the inescapable nature of His judgment. This can be contrasted with the hope of eternal life offered through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Refers to humanity, specifically those who are experiencing the torment described in the preceding verses.

Men will seek for death in vain; they will long to die, and lo ! death is seen fleeing from them. We can see an age in which death will be regarded as a sweet respite from the tormenting trials of life: men will stretch out their hands to death as to a welcome deliverer; but behold! death is seen fleeing from them. The word translated "desire" in our English version is a strong word; it has been rendered <span class= "ital">vehemently desire:</span> it is a passionate longing, as the yearning of the soul after one we love. There have been ages in which men have thus pined for death, in which light and life seem but mockeries to the miserable, and men "long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures" (<a href="/context/job/3-20.htm" title="Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;">Job 3:20-21</a>).
