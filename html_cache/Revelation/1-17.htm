The context is the island of Patmos, where John was exiled. The vision is a theophany, a divine appearance, similar to those experienced by prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel. The sight of Christ in His glory is overwhelming, indicating His divine majesty and holiness.<p><b>I fell at His feet like a dead man.</b><br>John's reaction is one of utter awe and reverence, common in biblical encounters with the divine. This response is seen in other scriptural accounts, such as Daniel's vision (<a href="/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8-9</a>) and Paul's encounter on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). It signifies the overwhelming power and holiness of God, which often renders humans powerless.<p><b>But He placed His right hand on me</b><br>The right hand symbolizes authority, power, and blessing. In biblical times, the right hand was often associated with strength and favor. By placing His right hand on John, Christ conveys reassurance and empowerment, indicating His personal care and authority over the situation.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Do not be afraid.</b><br>This command is a common divine reassurance found throughout Scripture, from the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>) to the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). It reflects God's desire to comfort and encourage His people, especially in moments of fear or uncertainty. The presence of Christ dispels fear, emphasizing His role as the Prince of Peace.<p><b>I am the First and the Last,</b><br>This title affirms Christ's eternal nature and divine sovereignty, echoing God's self-revelation in <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>. It underscores His preexistence and eternal reign, affirming His deity.

Stand in holy fear, yet rest in His fearless love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">I fell at his feet as dead</span>.--At the sight of Him, the Evangelist fell as one dead. "Was this He whom upon earth St. John had known so familiarly? Was this He in whose bosom He had lain at that Last Supper, and said, 'Lord, which is he that betrayeth Thee?' When I saw Him thus transformed, thus glorified, I fell at His feet as one dead. Well might such be the effect, even upon the spirit of a just man made perfect--and St. John was still in the body--of such an open revelation of the risen glory of Christ" (Dr. Vaughan). It was pity, and the pang felt at the severity of retribution which overtook sin, which made Dante fall as a dead body falls (<span class= "ital">Inferno,</span> v.); it is the felt consciousness of unworthiness which seems to have overcome the Evangelist. This consciousness has its witness outside the Bible as well as in it. "Semele must perish if Jupiter reveals himself to her in his glory, being consumed in the brightness of that glory." (Comp. <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, "Thou canst not see My face; for there shall no man see Me and live.") For every man it is a dreadful thing to stand face to face with God. Yet the consciousness of this unworthiness to behold God, or to receive a near revelation of His presence, is a sign of faith, and is welcomed as such. Of him who said, "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof," Christ said, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel" (<a href="/context/matthew/8-8.htm" title="The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.">Matthew 8:8-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not.</span>--The words "unto me" should be omitted. The gesture is designed to give the assurance of comfort; the hand which was raised up to bless (<a href="/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>), which was reached forth to heal the leper, to raise the sinking Peter (<a href="/matthew/14-31.htm" title="And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?">Matthew 14:31</a>), and to touch the wounded ear of Malchus, is now stretched out to reassure His servant; and the words, like those which John had heard upon the Mount of Transfiguration, and when toiling against the waves of Galilee, bid him not to be afraid. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I fell at his feet as dead</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as one dead - as a dead man.</span> St. Peter had fallen at Jesus' feet when he became conscious of the ineffable difference between sinlessness and sinfulness (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>). How much more, therefore, would consciousness of the glorified Christ overwhelm St. John! Long years of contemplation of the incarnate Son would not prevent that. In like manner, Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17, 27</a>), and St. Paul (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>) are affected by the Divine presence. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not</span>. Thus Christ encouraged the terrified apostles on the lake (<a href="/john/6-20.htm">John 6:20</a>) and at the Transfiguration. So also the angel cheered Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>), Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), the shepherds (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>), and the women at the sepulchre (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
