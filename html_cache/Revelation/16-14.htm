In biblical context, demonic spirits are often associated with deception and opposition to God's purposes. The presence of demonic spirits in Revelation highlights the spiritual warfare that underlies the events of the end times. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of the struggle against spiritual forces of evil.<p><b>that perform signs</b><br>The ability of these spirits to perform signs suggests a supernatural power intended to deceive and manipulate. In the Bible, signs and wonders can be used by both God and false prophets (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). The signs performed by these demonic spirits are likely counterfeit miracles meant to lead people astray, reminiscent of the magicians in Pharaoh's court who mimicked Moses' miracles (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>).<p><b>and go out to all the kings of the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the global scope of the demonic influence, reaching all the rulers of the world. The kings of the earth often symbolize political and military power. The demonic spirits' mission to influence these leaders suggests a coordinated effort to unite them against God. This echoes <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the kings of the earth set themselves against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>to assemble them for battle</b><br>The purpose of the demonic spirits is to gather the kings for a climactic confrontation. This assembly for battle is a recurring theme in apocalyptic literature, symbolizing the ultimate conflict between good and evil. The gathering for battle is reminiscent of the gathering of nations against Jerusalem in <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>.<p><b>on the great day of God the Almighty</b><br>This phrase refers to the eschatological "day of the Lord," a time of divine intervention and judgment. The "great day" signifies the culmination of God's plan and the final defeat of evil. The title "God the Almighty" emphasizes God's supreme power and authority over all creation. This day is prophesied in <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>, where it is described as a day of both judgment and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/demonic_spirits.htm">Demonic Spirits</a></b><br>These are malevolent spiritual beings that oppose God and His purposes.

Scripture consistently portrays demons as fallen angels who oppose God and deceive humanity (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>). Here they are unmasked, so readers grasp that coming world turmoil is not merely political but spiritual.<p>&#8226; Demons operate under Satan&#8217;s authority (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>).<p>&#8226; They tempt, oppress, and blind people to truth (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their exposure here underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;He reveals the enemy&#8217;s plans so believers are not caught off guard (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that perform signs</b><p>The spirits gain influence through supernatural displays. Jesus warned that &#8220;false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). Miraculous phenomena alone never authenticate truth; Scripture is the test (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>Remember:<p>&#8226; Signs can be genuine displays of power yet serve deception (<a href="/exodus/7-10.htm">Exodus 7:10&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God permits these signs to sift hearts&#8212;those who refuse the truth will embrace the lie (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers discern spirits by comparing every message to the gospel (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go out to all the kings of the earth</b><p>The reach is global.

Unlike ordinary battles, this day centers on the Almighty&#8217;s direct intervention, final judgment, and vindication of His people.<p>Highlights:<p>&#8226; Certainty&#8212;God set the day; it cannot be delayed (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Finality&#8212;sin, Satan, and death will face decisive defeat (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10, 14</a>).<p>&#8226; Hope&#8212;believers look forward to Christ&#8217;s appearing and kingdom (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a> pulls back the curtain on the unseen realm. Demonic spirits, truly personal and active, will dazzle the world&#8217;s leaders with signs, rallying them into a last, futile stand against God. Every phrase underscores both the reality of spiritual warfare and the absolute sovereignty of &#8220;God the Almighty.&#8221; For believers, the passage is a sober reminder to remain discerning, anchored in Scripture, and confident that the great day will vindicate Christ and all who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles.</span> This explains the account given in ver. 13. In the plague of the frogs, the Egyptian magicians imitated the plague of Moses; the second beast (the false prophet) is represented as leading men astray by his miracles (<a href="/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>). After the sixth trumpet came the digression, in which an account was given of the two witnesses of God, who worked miracles (<a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.); here, after the sixth vial, we have a short digression, in which an account is given of the three witnesses of Satan, who endeavour rework on his behalf, by exhibiting miracles. (For the meaning of this working of miracles, see on Revelation 13:13.) <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world;</span> <span class="accented">the kings of the whole world -</span> omitting "of the earth" (Revised Version). <span class="accented">The kings of the world</span> are those whose aim and delight is the possession of the pleasures of this world; those who have their treasure in this world, and whose hearts are therefore also there; those who exercise their influence and power in regard only to the things of this world; in short, the worldly. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty;</span> <span class="accented">God, the Almighty.</span> This battle is described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, which see. <span class="accented">The great day</span> is the last great judgment day. The battle referred to here, and described in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, and again in <a href="/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-10</a>, is apparently the battle which is being waged against God by the forces of evil all through the history of the world, from the fall of Adam until the last judgment day. This seems certain from the description given in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. and 20. How, then, can it be described as the "battle of the great day"? Probably because on that day will occur the crisis, as it were, of the conflict; on that day will the issue be plainly determined, and the struggle terminated. Though the battle is proceeding daily, there is little to remind us of it; the very existence of, and necessity for, such warfare is sometimes forgotten in the daily round of life: at the last day will be plainly exhibited the nature of the incessant hostility between God and the devil, and the power of the latter will be manifested only to be visibly shattered and finally destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[These] are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eisin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
