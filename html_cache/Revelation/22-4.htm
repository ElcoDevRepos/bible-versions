In biblical context, seeing God's face is a privilege denied to humanity since the fall, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, where God tells Moses that no one can see His face and live. The promise of seeing God's face in <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a> indicates a restored relationship and the removal of sin's barrier. This aligns with the Beatitude in <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God," suggesting purity and holiness are prerequisites for this vision. Theologically, it represents the consummation of salvation and the believer's transformation into Christlikeness, as mentioned in 1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>, "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."<p><b>and His name will be on their foreheads</b><br>This phrase symbolizes ownership, identity, and protection. In the ancient world, marking or sealing indicated possession and authority. The name on the forehead signifies that believers belong to God, contrasting with the mark of the beast in <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16-17</a>, which denotes allegiance to the Antichrist. This imagery echoes the high priest in <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>, who wore a plate on his forehead inscribed with "Holy to the Lord," signifying consecration. Theologically, it reflects the fulfillment of the New Covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people. It also assures believers of their eternal security and divine protection, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where the overcomer is promised God's name written upon them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose face the redeemed will see.

The barrier that once kept fallen humanity from gazing on God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>) is forever removed.<p>&#8226; Fulfilled longing. From David&#8217;s yearning to &#8220;behold the beauty of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>) to Jesus&#8217; pledge that &#8220;the pure in heart&#8230;will see God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), Scripture builds toward this climactic moment.<p>&#8226; Perfect fellowship. Paul anticipated a day when we would know God &#8220;face to face&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). John adds that when Christ appears &#8220;we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). Our glorified state enables a direct, unfiltered communion with our Savior.<p>&#8226; Eternal satisfaction. Every glimpse of God&#8217;s presence in Scripture&#8212;Isaiah&#8217;s temple vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>), the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>)&#8212;left witnesses awestruck. In the New Jerusalem this awe becomes our constant reality (<a href="/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His name will be on their foreheads</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and His name will be on their foreheads&#8221;, a mark rich with meaning.<p>&#8226; Identity and ownership. Just as servants bore a master&#8217;s seal, believers display God&#8217;s name, showing we belong to Him forever (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; 14:1).<p>&#8226; Public witness. The forehead is visible to all, contrasting sharply with the hidden mark of the beast (<a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>). Our allegiance to Christ is open and unmistakable.<p>&#8226; Priestly privilege. Aaron wore &#8220;HOLY TO THE LORD&#8221; on his forehead (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>). In eternity every saint shares that priestly honor (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; 5:10).<p>&#8226; Protection and security. Before the judgments fell, God&#8217;s servants were sealed on the forehead for safety (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3-4</a>). That protective seal now becomes a permanent emblem of our inviolable security.<p>&#8226; Transformation of character. Bearing His name signifies sharing His holy nature (<a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>), a complete reversal of the fall&#8217;s defilement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a> assures believers of two eternal realities: unhindered, face-to-face fellowship with God and an indelible mark of belonging to Him.
