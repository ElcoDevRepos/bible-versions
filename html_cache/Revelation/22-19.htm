The warning against altering the text reflects a broader biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>, where adding to or subtracting from God's word is strictly prohibited. The "book of prophecy" refers specifically to the Book of Revelation, which is considered a culmination of biblical prophecy, revealing the ultimate victory of Christ and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>God will take away his share in the tree of life</b><br>The "tree of life" is a symbol of eternal life and blessing, first introduced in <a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a> in the Garden of Eden. Its reappearance in Revelation signifies the restoration of paradise and the eternal life promised to believers. The warning here is severe, indicating that tampering with the divine message results in forfeiting one's right to eternal life. This underscores the gravity of maintaining the integrity of Scripture.<p><b>and the holy city</b><br>The "holy city" refers to the New Jerusalem, described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a> as descending from heaven. It represents the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people, a place of perfect peace, holiness, and communion with God. The loss of one's share in the holy city signifies exclusion from the eternal fellowship and blessings that God has prepared for His faithful.<p><b>which are described in this book</b><br>This phrase points back to the detailed descriptions found throughout Revelation, particularly in chapters 21 and 22, where the tree of life and the holy city are vividly depicted. The book serves as a comprehensive revelation of God's final plan for humanity, and the descriptions are meant to provide hope and assurance to believers.

Any deliberate editing of God&#8217;s Word is viewed as rebellion against the Author.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will take away his share</b><p>&#8226; Divine justice mirrors the offense: remove God&#8217;s words, and God removes the offender&#8217;s privileges.<p>&#8226; Scripture pictures salvation as an inheritance or &#8220;share&#8221; granted to believers (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). Here that share is forfeited, underscoring that genuine faith reveres and preserves God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning is not aimed at momentary doubts or honest questions but at willful, persistent distortion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the tree of life</b><p>&#8226; The tree of life, first seen in Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22-24</a>), reappears in the new creation as the symbol of eternal life (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; 22:2, 14).<p>&#8226; Losing access to it means exclusion from everlasting fellowship with God.<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: guarding Scripture leads to &#8220;the right to the tree of life&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-14.htm">Revelation 22:14</a>); tampering with Scripture loses that right.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the holy city</b><p>&#8226; The holy city is the New Jerusalem, the eternal dwelling of God with His people (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Nothing unclean or deceitful enters that city (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).
