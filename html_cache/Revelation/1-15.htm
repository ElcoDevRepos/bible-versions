In biblical times, bronze was a symbol of judgment and endurance, often used in the construction of altars and temple furnishings (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-6</a>). The refining process in a furnace indicates purification and perfection, suggesting that Christ's judgment is both pure and righteous. This description connects to <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, where a similar vision of a heavenly being is described, emphasizing the divine nature and authority of Christ. The polished bronze also reflects the glory and majesty of Jesus, who stands firm and unmovable, symbolizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<p><b>and His voice was like the roar of many waters</b><br>The comparison of Christ's voice to the roar of many waters conveys power, authority, and majesty. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>, where the glory of God is described with a voice like the sound of many waters, indicating divine presence and overwhelming authority. The sound of many waters can be both awe-inspiring and fearsome, suggesting that Christ's words carry immense power and command attention. This also reflects the idea that His voice is heard throughout the earth, reaching all nations and peoples, much like the sound of a mighty waterfall or ocean waves.

The Son of Man stands upon that same picture&#8212;His footing is anchored in righteous judgment.<p>&#8226; The metal is &#8220;polished&#8221; and &#8220;refined,&#8221; meaning every impurity has been driven out. Nothing in Him is tarnished (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel saw a similar figure: &#8220;His arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>), linking the glorified Christ with the heavenly messenger who terrified Daniel.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s cherubim had &#8220;soles&#8230; like the gleam of polished bronze&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>), underscoring a heavenly, other-worldly brilliance.<p>&#8226; When Christ addresses Thyatira He repeats the image: &#8220;whose feet are like polished bronze&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>), stressing His authority to search hearts and repay works.<p>Takeaway: those feet move through the churches and the nations alike, unsoiled, unstoppable, and fully prepared to crush wickedness (<a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His voice was like the roar of many waters</b><p>Having shown His feet, John next hears His voice&#8212;a thunderous, cascading power.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel felt the same overwhelming sound: &#8220;His voice was like the roar of many waters&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>).

The exact meaning of this word (used only here) is not certain. The most trustworthy authors incline to take it as a hybrid word, half Greek, half Hebrew--<span class= "ital">chalcos, </span>brass, and <span class= "ital">laban, </span>white, to whiten--and understand it to signify brass which has attained in the furnace a white heat. "Such technical words were likely enough to be current in a population like that of Ephesus, consisting largely of workers in metal, some of whom--if we may judge from the case of Alexander the coppersmith (<a href="/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>)--were, without doubt, Jews. I believe the word in question to have belonged to this technical vocabulary.

This image the Evangelist adopts to describe the voice of Christ--strong and majestic, amid the Babel-sounds of earth. That voice, whose word stilled the sea, sounds as the waves of the sea, which St. John heard Him rebuke. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fine brass</span>.

In what follows, the Revised Version is to be preferred: "as if <span class="accented">it had been refined</span> in a furnace; and his voice as the <span class="accented">voice</span> of many waters." It is tempting to think that "the roar of the sea is in the ears of the lonely man in Patmos;" but the image seems rather to be that of the sound of many cataracts (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>).
