This specific address confirms that the message applies to a local body, yet, as with all Scripture (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>), it remains relevant to every church today.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Write&#8221; commands John to record the words verbatim (<a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 19</a>). Scripture&#8217;s authority rests on its written form; as <a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a> instructs, God&#8217;s revelations are to be inscribed so they may be read and obeyed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;These are the words of Him&#8221; signals divine authorship.

John had just seen this in the vision: &#8220;In His right hand He held seven stars&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>). The right hand is the place of power (<a href="/psalms/118-16.htm">Psalm 118:16</a>).<p>&#8211; The same hand keeps believers secure: &#8220;No one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-29.htm">John 10:29</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a> reminds us that &#8220;in Him all things hold together,&#8221; so the churches&#8212;and their leaders&#8212;rest firmly in His grasp.<p>&#8226; The number seven, repeatedly used in Revelation, represents completeness.

Jesus holds the stars&#8212;church leaders&#8212;in His powerful right hand, demonstrating ownership and protection, and He walks among the lampstands, signifying His close, ongoing oversight of every congregation.

Accepting the earlier date--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the reign of Nero, or (with Gebhardt) of Galba--the angel is no other than Timothy. Some striking coincidences favour this view. Labour, work, endurance, are what St. Paul acknowledges in Timothy, and which he exhorts him to cultivate more and more (<a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm" title="The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.">2Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>). Again, against false teachers he warns him (<a href="/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.">1Timothy 1:7</a>). Further, there is "a latent tone of anxiety" in the Epistles to Timothy. The nature with which he had to do was emotional even to tears, ascetic, devout; but there was in it a tendency to lack of energy and sustained enthusiasm. "He urges him to stand up, to rekindle the grace of God, just as here there is a hint of a first love left." (See Prof. Plumptre, <span class= "ital">Ep. to Seven Churches.</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-3:22.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistles to the seven Churches.</span> Once more we have to consider rival interpretations. Of these we may safely set aside all those which make the seven letters to be pictures of <span class="accented">successive periods</span> in the history of the Church. On the other hand, we may safely deny that the letters are <span class="accented">purely typical</span>, and relate to nothing definite in history. Rather they are <span class="accented">both historical and typical.</span> They refer primarily to the actual condition of the several Churches in St. John's own day, and then are intended for the instruction, encouragement, and warning of the Church and the Churches throughout all time. The Catholic Church, or any one of its branches, will at any period find itself reflected in one or other of the seven Churches. For two Churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, there is nothing but praise; for two, Sardis and Laodicea, nothing but blame; for the majority, and among them the chief Church of all, Ephesus, with Pergamum and Thyatira, praise and blame in different degrees intermingled. The student will find it instructive to place the epistles side by side in seven parallel columns, and note the elements common to each and the order in which these elements appear. These common elements are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's command</span> to the seer to write; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">his title</span>, which in most cases is taken from the descriptions in <a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">praise</span>, or <span class="accented">blame</span>, or both, addressed to the angel, based in all cases on intimate personal knowledge - "I know thy works;"  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
