In biblical literature, a loud voice often indicates divine revelation or significant announcements (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 7</a>:10). The collective voice suggests unity and agreement among the heavenly beings, emphasizing the universal acknowledgment of the Lamb's worthiness.<p><b>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain:</b><br>The "Lamb" is a title for Jesus Christ, symbolizing His role as the sacrificial offering for humanity's sins (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The imagery of the Lamb is rooted in the Passover lamb of <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, which was a type of Christ. The phrase "who was slain" refers to Jesus' crucifixion, highlighting the centrality of His sacrificial death in Christian theology.

The Lamb&#8217;s sacrificial death secures sevenfold fullness&#8212;power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing&#8212;rightly returned to Him. Heaven&#8217;s worship models the believer&#8217;s calling: loudly, joyfully, and comprehensively proclaim the worth of the slain yet victorious Lamb.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Saying with a loud voice . </span>. .--The second chorus: the chorus of angels--<p>"Worthy is the Lamb,<p>That hath been slain,<p>To receive the power.<p>And riches, and wisdom, and might,<p>And honour, and glory, and blessing."<p>The doxology is seven-fold. We have noticed (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>) the increasing strength of the doxologies in which the redeemed take part. This, though a <span class= "ital">sevenfold</span> one, does not interrupt that advance of praise; for in this chorus the redeemed do not take part. The definite article is prefixed to the word "power" only; in the doxologies of <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm" title="Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 7:12</a> it stands before each word. This has led some to view the single article as prefixed to all that follows, and to regard all the words as though they formed one word. May it not, however, be used to give emphasis to the "power"? None, above or below, was "able" (same word as "power" here) to open the book (<a href="/revelation/5-3.htm" title="And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.">Revelation 5:3</a>); but the Lamb has conquered to open it, and the chorus proclaims the Lamb worthy of that power. Some have thought that the seven terms of the doxology refer to the seven seals which the Lamb is about to open. This seems strained. The notion of completeness is common to this seven-fold blessing and the seven seals; this is the only connection between them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">great voice</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "saying," is irregular construction, and to be referred to <span class="accented">angels</span> as being a nominative understood. <span class="cmt_word">Worthy is the Lamb that was slain;</span> <span class="accented">that hath been slain</span> (Revised Version).
