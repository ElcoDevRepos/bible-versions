Wisdom in biblical terms often refers to a God-given ability to perceive spiritual truths (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The book of Revelation is apocalyptic literature, rich in symbolism and requiring divine insight to interpret its meanings accurately. This call for wisdom echoes the need for understanding in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, where wisdom is paramount.<p><b>The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</b><br>The "seven heads" symbolize seven mountains, which many scholars and theologians associate with the city of Rome, historically known as the city on seven hills. This geographical reference would have been familiar to the original audience of Revelation, as Rome was the center of power and persecution against Christians at the time. The "woman" is often interpreted as representing a corrupt system or city, possibly symbolizing the Roman Empire or a future manifestation of worldly power opposed to God. The imagery of mountains can also be seen in other biblical contexts as symbols of strength and stability (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), but here they are linked to a worldly power that is ultimately transient and opposed to God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolic of a great city or entity that holds significant power and influence.

Believers are expected to approach prophetic truth humbly, trusting God to reveal meaning in His timing (<a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The seven heads are seven mountains</b><p>&#8226; John identifies the seven heads of the beast (first seen in <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>) as &#8220;seven mountains.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Mountains frequently symbolize ruling powers in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the phrase evokes the famous seven-hilled city of Rome&#8212;a natural match for the contemporaneous seat of imperial power. This fits the first-century context of John&#8217;s readers (<a href="/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>), who associated Rome with persecution and idolatry.<p>&#8226; Yet prophecy often layers meaning. <a href="/bsb/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2 and 7</a> link successive empires with symbolic imagery; likewise, these &#8220;mountains&#8221; can anticipate a series of kingdoms culminating in the beast&#8217;s final form (<a href="/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus, the mountains represent both a real geographic setting and successive political entities opposed to God&#8212;each embraced by the woman&#8217;s corrupting influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On which the woman sits</b><p>&#8226; The woman, earlier called &#8220;Babylon the Great&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>), is shown sitting on both the beast (<a href="/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>) and these mountains.<p>&#8226; Her posture of sitting conveys authority, alliance, and exploitation (<a href="/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, Babylon typifies organized rebellion against God (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>). In the end times, this rebellion coalesces into a global religious-political system that rides, directs, and ultimately is destroyed by the beast it once controlled (<a href="/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery portrays:<p>&#8211; Geographical scope: rooted in earthly centers of power.<p>&#8211; Political reach: intertwined with ruling empires.<p>&#8211; Spiritual corruption: intoxicating &#8220;the kings of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God permits this arrangement for a season, then judges it decisively (<a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9</a> urges Spirit-guided insight to grasp how the woman (Babylon) exerts influence over successive earthly powers, pictured as seven mountains.

Attention is asked to the fuller explanation which follows. It needs true wisdom to behold many incidents of the world's history and not find stumbling-blocks in them (<a href="/context/psalms/73-2.htm" title="But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well near slipped.">Psalm 73:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-165.htm" title="Great peace have they which love your law: and nothing shall offend them.">Psalm 119:165</a>). <span class= "ital">The seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sitteth upon them.</span> The description seems to be drawn from Rome, the seven-hilled city. This keeps the reference to Rome before us, but at the same time the further explanation (in <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>) widens our thoughts, and shows us that the literalism on which the imagery is based is used to convey a broader symbolical meaning. <span class= "ital">The seven heads are seven mountains, &c.,</span> <span class= "ital">and they</span> (the seven heads; the words "There are seven kings" in the English version are confusing) <span class= "ital">are seven kings:</span> the woman rides on the seven-headed beast; even so Rome dwells on her seven hills, and so also the world-city, seen in vision, sits among the various empires which have risen, like great mountains, in the history of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And here is the mind which hath wisdom.</span> Omit "and." Read, <span class="accented">Here is the mind</span> (or, <span class="accented">meaning</span>), etc. These words (as in <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>) draw attention to the explanation which follows - or else that which precedes (cf. <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). They also make it appear that the explanation which the angel offers of the "mystery" is not one to be understood without some difficulty. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. The diversity of opinions on the interpretation of this passage is mainly owing to the fact that writers are not consistent in their application of symbols and numbers; in one place interpreting figuratively, in another literally. We have repeatedly seen that the language of the Apocalypse and its numbers are symbolical. The seals are not literal seals, the Lamb is not a literal Lamb, the beast is not a literal beast, etc. So here, the <span class="accented">mountains</span> are not literal mountains. A mountain is a symbol of power (see on Revelation 8:8); <span class="accented">seven</span> is the number significant of universality (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). The plain meaning of the passage, therefore, is that the woman relies upon a visibly universal power. This is precisely the idea contained in ver. 3, which describes the faithless part of the Church (the harlot) trusting to the power of the world (the beast). Of course, the most prominent form of this world power in St. John's time was heathen Rome, hence some writers believe that "the seven-hilled city," Rome, is referred to here - either pagan or papal Rome. And, indeed, this may be a partial fulfilment of the vision; but it is not the whole signification. To understand <span class="accented">seven mountains</span> literally in this place renders it necessary to interpret forty-two weeks, etc., literally in another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This calls for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8047;&#948;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5602.htm">Strong's 5602: </a> </span><span class="str2">From an adverb form of hode; in this same spot, i.e. Here or hither.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a mind</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(nous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3563.htm">Strong's 3563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the base of ginosko; the intellect, i.e. Mind; by implication, meaning.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
