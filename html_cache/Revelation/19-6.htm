In biblical context, a "great multitude" often refers to the collective body of believers or heavenly beings. This imagery is reminiscent of the worship scenes in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>, where a multitude from every nation stands before the throne. The sound signifies the power and unity of worship in heaven, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promises to gather His people.<p><b>like the rushing of many waters</b><br>The comparison to "many waters" suggests a powerful, continuous, and overwhelming sound. This imagery is used in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a> to describe the voice of God, indicating majesty and authority. The sound of rushing waters can symbolize the voice of God or the collective voice of His people, emphasizing the grandeur and awe-inspiring nature of divine worship.<p><b>and like a mighty rumbling of thunder</b><br>Thunder often symbolizes God's voice and presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. It conveys power, authority, and the awe-inspiring nature of God's revelation. The use of thunder here underscores the majesty and authority of the proclamation being made, aligning with the themes of divine judgment and sovereignty found throughout Revelation.<p><b>crying out: &#8220;Hallelujah!</b><br>"Hallelujah" is a Hebrew word meaning "Praise the Lord." It is a call to worship and adoration, used frequently in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/146.htm">Psalm 146-150</a>). In Revelation, it marks a climactic moment of praise, celebrating God's victory and reign. This is one of the few places in the New Testament where "Hallelujah" appears, highlighting its significance in the heavenly worship scene.<p><b>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.</b><br>This declaration affirms God's sovereignty and ultimate authority over all creation. The title "the Almighty" emphasizes His omnipotence and eternal rule, a recurring theme in Revelation (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 4</a>:8). The phrase echoes Old Testament proclamations of God's kingship, such as in <a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, and anticipates the fulfillment of His kingdom as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>.

These words connect the present passage with <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>. They exhibit, as it were, the culminating reason for this adoration of God. He has exhibited his almighty power in the overthrow of Babylon, who said, "I sit a queen;" and in the overthrow (which has yet to be narrated more fully) of the kings of the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/19-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
