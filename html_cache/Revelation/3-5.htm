The concept of overcoming is a recurring theme in Revelation, emphasizing perseverance and victory over sin and the world (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 2</a>:11, 2:17, 2:26). The "white" garments symbolize purity, righteousness, and victory. In the ancient world, white robes were often worn during celebrations and symbolized festivity and triumph. Biblically, white garments are associated with holiness and the righteousness of the saints (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). This imagery connects to the transfiguration of Jesus, where His clothes became dazzling white (<a href="/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>), symbolizing divine glory and purity.<p><b>And I will never blot out his name from the Book of Life,</b><br>The "Book of Life" is a metaphorical record of those who have eternal life. This concept appears throughout Scripture, indicating those who belong to God (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). The assurance that one's name will not be blotted out underscores the security of salvation for those who are faithful. In ancient cities, citizens' names were recorded in a register, and names could be removed if someone was deemed unworthy. This promise assures believers of their eternal citizenship in the heavenly kingdom, contrasting with the potential erasure from earthly records.<p><b>but I will confess his name before My Father and His angels.</b><br>This promise echoes Jesus' words in the Gospels, where He states that whoever acknowledges Him before others, He will also acknowledge before His Father in heaven (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>). The act of confessing one's name signifies acceptance and approval by Christ. In the cultural context, public acknowledgment by a figure of authority was a significant honor, affirming one's status and relationship with that authority. This assurance highlights the intimate relationship between Christ and the believer, as well as the believer's ultimate vindication and acceptance in the divine court.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_is_victorious.htm">The One Who is Victorious</a></b><br>Refers to believers who overcome spiritual challenges and remain faithful to Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/white_garments.htm">White Garments</a></b><br>Symbolize purity, righteousness, and victory over sin, often associated with the redeemed in heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_life.htm">The Book of Life</a></b><br>A heavenly record of those who have eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who promises to acknowledge the faithful before God the Father and the angels.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_sardis.htm">The Church in Sardis</a></b><br>The original audience of this message, known for its reputation of being alive but spiritually dead.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_through_faith.htm">Victory Through Faith</a></b><br>Emphasize that spiritual victory is achieved through steadfast faith in Jesus Christ, despite trials and temptations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_white_garments.htm">Symbolism of White Garments</a></b><br>Encourage believers to pursue a life of purity and righteousness, reflecting their identity in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Highlight the assurance that comes from having one's name in the Book of Life, providing comfort and motivation for holy living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_confession.htm">Public Confession</a></b><br>Stress the importance of openly confessing faith in Christ, knowing that He will acknowledge us before the Father.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Urge believers to remain spiritually alert and active, avoiding the complacency that plagued the church in Sardis.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_3_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 3:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Rev_3_5_inspire_perseverance.htm">How does Revelation 3:5 encourage perseverance in your Christian walk today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_white_garments_in_Rev_3_5.htm">What does "clothed in white garments" symbolize for believers in Revelation 3:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Rev_3_5_to_John_3_16_s_eternal_life.htm">How does Revelation 3:5 connect with the promise of eternal life in John 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_your_name_in_the_Book_of_Life.htm">In what ways can you ensure your name remains in the "Book of Life"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_honor_Christ_publicly.htm">How can you publicly acknowledge Christ, as mentioned in Revelation 3:5, daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_clothed_in_white_garments.htm">What does Revelation 3:5 mean by "clothed in white garments"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_3_5_and_eternal_security.htm">How does Revelation 3:5 relate to the concept of eternal security?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Book_of_Life_Rev_3_5.htm">What is the significance of the "Book of Life" in Revelation 3:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_rev_3_5_align_with_free_will.htm">How can Revelation 3:5&#8217;s promise of not erasing names from the Book of Life align with the concept of free will or potential apostasy in other scriptures?

Jesus is saying, &#8220;Follow their example; keep walking in purity.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The promise is conditional: victory belongs to believers who stay true. This fits the consistent New Testament call to endure (<a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be dressed in white</b><p>&#8226; White garments picture righteousness made possible by Christ&#8217;s atonement (<a href="/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13&#8211;14</a>; 19:7&#8211;8).<p>&#8226; White also conveys victory and celebration, as in Roman culture where conquerors wore white robes&#8212;an image the first-century readers would feel.<p>&#8226; Jesus clothes His people, just as the prodigal was robed by the father (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>); we bring the need, He supplies the purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will never blot out his name from the Book of Life</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;Book of Life&#8221; is a real, heavenly register of those saved for eternity (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 15</a>; 21:27).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Never blot out&#8221; underscores absolute security for the believer who overcomes. The double negative in Greek amplifies the guarantee: removal is impossible for the faithful.<p>&#8226; Old Testament background: Moses pleaded that his name be blotted out for Israel&#8217;s sake, but God declared, &#8220;Whoever has sinned against Me I will blot out of My book&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32&#8211;33</a>).

Those who keep trusting Christ are clothed in His righteousness, kept eternally secure in the Book of Life, and openly owned by Jesus before the Father and the angels. The verse calls every disciple to steadfast faith, confident that victory in Christ brings unending honor and life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He that overcometh.</span>--The promise is repeated to all who overcome; all, not who have never fallen, or failed, but who conquer, shall be clothed in glistening white raiment. On this glistering appearance comp. Dante's words, "robed in hue of living flame," and the description so frequent in the <span class= "ital">Pilgrim's Progress</span>--"the shining ones." Trench, who reminds us that this glistening white is found in the symbolism of heathen antiquity, says: "The glorified body, defecated of all its dregs and impurities, whatever remained of those having been <span class= "ital">precipitated</span> in death, and now transformed and transfigured into the likeness of Christ's body (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>), this, with its robe, atmosphere, and effluence of lights, is itself, I believe, the white raiment which Christ here promises to His redeemed." Professor Lightfoot thinks (see his <span class= "ital">Epistle to Col.</span> p. 22) that there may be a reference to the purple dyes for which Sardis, as well as Thyatira, was celebrated.<p><span class= "bld">I will not blot out . . .</span>--The negative is emphatic, "I will in no wise blot out." This figure of speech--a book and the blotting out--was ancient. (See <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm" title="For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm" title="They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.">Psalm 69:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm" title="And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.">Daniel 12:1</a>; comp. also <a href="/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.) The name shall not be erased from the roll or register of the citizens of heaven. "A process of erasure is ever going on, besides the process of entering. When the soul has finally taken its choice for evil, when Christ is utterly denied on earth and trodden under foot, when the defilement of sin has become inveterate and indelible, then the pen is drawn through the guilty name, then the inverted style smears the wax over the unworthy characters; and when the owner of that name applies afterwards for admittance, the answer is, 'I know thee not; depart hence, thou willing worker and lover of iniquity'" (Dr. Vaughan). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments</span>. It is difficult to see on what principles of criticism Alford retains the reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of that rightly accepted by the Revisers, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The latter has a very decided balance of external evidence in its favour; the former is a corruption very likely to occur either accidentally or in order to introduce a construction very frequent in St. John (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>; <a href="/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-9.htm">2 John 1:9</a>). The change from "clothed" (Authorized Version) to "arrayed" (Revised Version) here and elsewhere is no doubt made in order to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But neither the Authorized Version (John 17:4; 19:8) nor the Revised Version (John 11:3; 15:6) is consistent. The Authorized Version generally renders both words "clothed." The Revised Version generally has "arrayed" for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and "clothed" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version is singularly capricious in having "garments" for <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and "raiment" for the same word in ver. 5. The construction, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, occurs again in <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, and once or twice in the LXX. (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>); the usual construction is with the accusative. The promise in this verse is again threefold, the last of the three promises in ver. 4 being repeated here as the first in this triplet. Repetitions of a similar kind are very frequent in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 5</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; <a href="/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will in no wise blot out his name</span>. The negative, as in vers. 3 and 12, is in the strongest form. Here we seem to have a figure borrowed from the custom of striking the names of the dead out of the list of citizens. But the figure is a very ancient one, as is seen from parallels in the Old Testament. The present passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> is singularly close to the LXX. of <a href="/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; and to <a href="/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a>, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; comp. <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; and for the exact expression, "the book of life," see <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; and (without articles) <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, where Bishop Lightfoot comments as follows: "The 'book of life' in the figurative language of the Old Testament is the register of the covenant people (comp. <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>). Hence 'to be blotted out of the book of the living' means 'to forfeit the privileges of the theocracy, to be shut out from God's favour.' But the expression, though perhaps confined originally to temporal blessings, was in itself a witness to higher hopes; and in the Book of Daniel first it distinctly refers to a blessed immortality (comp. Hermas, 'Vis.,' 1:3; see also <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>)? And I will confess his name. Without the smallest manuscript authority or any encouragement from previous versions, Latin, German, or English, the Genevan and Authorized Versions here render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "but"! The simple connexion with "and" is thoroughly in St. John's style: "He shall be... <span class="accented">and</span> I will... <span class="accented">and</span> I will" (comp. vers. 12, 17; <a href="/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26-28</a>, etc.; <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 10, 11, 14</a>, etc.).
