In the ancient world, the sea often represented chaos and danger, but here it is calm and clear, indicating God's sovereign control over chaos. The imagery may also connect to the "molten sea" in Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>), which was a large basin used for ritual purification, suggesting themes of cleansing and sanctification. The clarity "as clear as crystal" emphasizes the perfection and transparency of God's presence, inviting believers to approach with reverence and awe.<p><b>In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures,</b><br>The "four living creatures" are reminiscent of the cherubim described in <a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-14</a> and the seraphim in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>. These beings serve as guardians of God's holiness and are often associated with His throne. Their placement "in the center, around the throne" signifies their close proximity to God, indicating their role in worship and service. The number four may symbolize universality, representing all of creation, as it often does in Scripture (e.g., four corners of the earth).<p><b>covered with eyes in front and back.</b><br>The eyes "in front and back" suggest complete awareness and knowledge, symbolizing God's omniscience. This imagery indicates that nothing escapes God's sight, and His creatures are endowed with the ability to perceive and understand His will fully. The eyes also imply vigilance and readiness to act according to God's commands, reflecting the creatures' role in executing divine judgment and mercy. This motif of eyes is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, where the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth, emphasizing God's all-seeing nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>Central to the vision, representing God's sovereign rule and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_glass.htm">Sea of Glass</a></b><br>Symbolic of purity, calmness, and the transcendence of God's presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_living_creatures.htm">Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>Mysterious beings that are full of eyes, symbolizing vigilance and knowledge, often interpreted as cherubim or seraphim.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who receives this vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_vision.htm">Heavenly Vision</a></b><br>The setting of this chapter, where John is given a glimpse into the heavenly realm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_majesty.htm">God's Sovereignty and Majesty</a></b><br>The throne and the sea of glass emphasize God's supreme authority and the peace that comes from His rule.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The crystal-clear sea symbolizes the purity and holiness required to approach God, reminding believers of the call to live holy lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_and_knowledge.htm">Vigilance and Knowledge</a></b><br>The eyes of the living creatures represent God's omniscience and the call for believers to be watchful and discerning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_worship.htm">Heavenly Worship</a></b><br>The presence of the living creatures around the throne highlights the importance of worship in the believer's life, reflecting the worship that takes place in heaven.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>This vision encourages believers to maintain an eternal perspective, focusing on the realities of heaven rather than the temporary struggles of earth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_4_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 4:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_4_creatures_in_Revelation.htm">What do the "four living creatures" symbolize in Revelation 4:6 for believers today?

By analogy, the calm glass-like sea, which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame (<a href="/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>), represents the counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love, often fathomless, but never obscure; always the same, though sometimes glowing with holy anger (<a href="/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>). (Comp. the Psalmist's words, "Thy judgments are like the great deep," <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>, Prayer Book version. See also <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm" title="Your way is in the sea, and your path in the great waters, and your footsteps are not known.">Psalm 77:19</a>, and <a href="/context/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33-36</a>.) The position of the crystal sea is analogous to that of the molten sea in front of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.">2Chronicles 4:9-10</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. <span class="accented">Sea of glass</span>, or <span class="accented">a glassy sea.</span> The quality of "glassiness" may refer to the pure <span class="accented">appearance</span> of the sea; or it may mean that the sea was in consistency like unto glass; that is, solid and unyielding, so that there was nothing strange in the fact that it supported weights. In either case, the notion is repeated by parallelism in the next clause, "like unto crystal." But the glassy sea may mean "a glass laver," and bear no reference to what is usually called a sea. The brazen laver is described (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>) as a "molten sea." St. John may therefore mean that before the throne of God was a laver of the purest material, just as the brazen laver was before the temple. One difficulty here presents itself, viz. that there would be no use for a laver in heaven, where all is pure, and the figure therefore appears a little incongruous. But as it stood <span class="accented">before</span> the throne, where all who came would have to pass by, it may fitly typify the waters of Baptism, passed by all Christians; and the figure would be aptly suggested to St. John by the furniture of the temple to which he has such constant allusions. <span class="cmt_word">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne</span>. This may mean either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, the throne being rectangular, the four living beings were in the middle of each side of the parallelogram; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> while one was in front of the throne, the other three formed a semicircle round it, one being directly behind, and two towards the ends. <span class="cmt_word">Were four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">or, four living creatures</span> (Revised Version); or, better still, <span class="accented">four living beings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>). The "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="/revelation/6-7.htm">Revelation 6:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc., must not be confounded with the "living ones" of this passage. The one quality connoted by the term here used is the possession of life. The question of the precise meaning and interpretation of the vision of "the living beings" is a difficult one, and much has been written concerning it. The vision is evidently connected with the appearances described in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10, and which are called in Isaiah "seraphim," in Ezekiel "cherubim." We are led, therefore, to inquire what mental ideas were pictured to the Jews under the symbolical forms of cherubim and seraphim. Cheyne shows ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 272) that the name <span class="accented">cherub</span> is probably connected with <span class="accented">kirubu</span>, the winged ox god of the Assyrians, and with <span class="accented">kurubu</span>, the vulture or eagle (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the guardians of the treasures of the gods); and he infers that among heathen nations the mythic cherubim denote the cloud-masses which appear to guard the portals of the sky, and on which the sun-god issues at break of day. With regard to the seraphim, he compares the name of the fiery serpents(<span class="accented">s'rafim</span>) of <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, and concludes that the term was symbolical of the lightning, the weapon of the gods. Now, in Old Testament passages the cherubim and seraphim are always pictured as the attendants of God, and the workers of his purposes and judgments - an idea which may readily have been assimilated by the Jews from the conceptions of their heathen neighbours. Thus cherubim with the flaming sword are placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); Jehovah rode upon a cherub, and did fly (<a href="/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>); he communes with his people from between the cherubim (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); he is the Shepherd of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim (<a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>); the temple in <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> is adorned with cherubim, as being the dwelling-place of God; they are the attendants of the glory of God in <a href="/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22-28</a>; and the seraphim fill an analogous position (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). We may therefore infer that the appearance of the "living beings" implied the presence of some order of beings in attendance upon God, the workers of his will, and the manifestation of his glory. Again, the term used (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>) and the characteristics of the appearance naturally and almost irresistibly lead us to interpret the form as one symbolical of <span class="accented">life.</span> The human face, the ox as the representative of domestic, and the lion of wild animals, and the eagle among birds, appear to be typical of the four most conspicuous orders of animal life. The ceaseless movements described in ver. 8 portray the same idea. The four living beings draw attention to the woes heaped upon created life (<a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote never-resting activity. We may therefore believe that the living beings are symbolical of all creation fulfilling its proper office - waiting upon God, fulfilling his will, and setting forth his glory. It is noteworthy that the human face, as distinct from the Church, which is represented by the four and twenty elders, appears to indicate the power of God to use, for his purposes and his glory, that part of mankind which has not been received into the Church - the part which constitutes the "other sheep, not of this fold" (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). These representatives of created life worship God, and give (ver. 11), as a reason for ascribing glory and honour to him, the circumstance that "thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created." The following are other interpretations: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The living beings represent the four Gospels. This view is held by many ancient writers, though there are many variations in assigning to each Gospel its own representative. Victorinus considers the <span class="accented">man</span> to be a type of St. Matthew, who sets forth prominently the human nature of our Lord; the kingly <span class="accented">lion</span> is referred to St. Mark; the sacrificial ox to St. Luke; the aspiring <span class="accented">eagle</span> to St. John. Amongst the supporters of this interpretation (though varying in the precise applicability) are St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Athanasius, St. Irenaeus, St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, Andreas, Primasius, Bede, I. Williams, Wordsworth (for a lull exposition of this view, see <span class="accented">Wordsworth, in loc.</span>).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">before</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;&#974;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en&#333;pion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1799.htm">Strong's 1799: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of a compound of en and a derivative of optanomai; in the face of.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
