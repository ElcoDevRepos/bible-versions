The temple is often seen as the dwelling place of God, symbolizing His holiness and sovereignty. In the context of Revelation, angels frequently serve as messengers or agents of God's will, emphasizing the divine orchestration of events. The temple imagery connects to the Old Testament, where the temple in Jerusalem was central to worship and God's presence among His people.<p><b>crying out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies urgency and authority, ensuring that the message is heard and heeded. In biblical literature, a loud voice often accompanies divine revelation or commands, underscoring the importance of the message. This urgency reflects the imminent nature of the events being described, aligning with the apocalyptic theme of Revelation.<p><b>to the One seated on the cloud</b><br>The One seated on the cloud is commonly interpreted as Jesus Christ, drawing on imagery from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, where the "Son of Man" comes with the clouds of heaven. Clouds are frequently associated with divine presence and glory, as seen in the transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>) and the ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>). This portrayal emphasizes Christ's authority and role in executing divine judgment.<p><b>&#8220;Swing Your sickle and reap</b><br>The sickle is a tool for harvesting, symbolizing judgment and the gathering of people. This imagery is rooted in agricultural practices familiar to the original audience, where reaping was a time of both reward and separation. The command to swing the sickle indicates the initiation of divine judgment, a theme prevalent throughout Revelation.<p><b>because the time has come to harvest</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's appointed time for judgment. The concept of an appointed time is consistent with biblical prophecy, where God has predetermined times for events (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>). The harvest metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the end of the age (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>), reinforcing the idea of divine timing and purpose.<p><b>for the crop of the earth is ripe</b><br>The ripeness of the crop suggests readiness for judgment, indicating that the conditions are now appropriate for God's intervention. This ripeness can be seen as the culmination of human actions and the fulfillment of prophetic events. The metaphor of ripeness implies that the moral and spiritual state of humanity has reached a point where divine judgment is justified, echoing themes of accountability and divine justice found throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_angel.htm">Another Angel</a></b><br>This angel emerges from the temple, signifying a divine message or command.

The angel who announces that the harvest is ready comes forth from the Temple, the inner shrine, the holy place which was measured off in the sanctuary of the faithful (<a href="/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a>); whereas the angel who calls for the vintage comes forth from the altar (<a href="/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>).<p>The angel cries--<span class= "ital">Put forth</span> (or, <span class= "ital">send</span>)<span class= "ital"> thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe</span> (or, <span class= "ital">dried</span>); the wheat stalks are dry, and the fields white for harvest (<a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>).

There is an autumn gladness about the harvest: there are tokens of judgment in the vintage. It is not the sharp sickle alone which is required: the winepress, the winepress of God's wrath, is called into use. An angel from the Temple calls to the Son of man to reap the harvest: an angel from the altar calls to an angel from the Temple to gather in the vintage. The vintage symbolises a harvest of judgment; do not the words respecting Babylon (the wine of the wrath of her fornication, <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>) come to the mind and confirm this? The angel rises from the altar, beneath which the murdered saints had cried, "How long?" and proclaims, "The vintage, the hour of vengeance, has come!" And it is not without significance that the angel to whom this cry is addressed comes forth out of the Temple, the safe sanctuary of God's faithful ones, as one who has witnessed their secret sorrows and their sufferings, and is fitted "to recompense tribulation to the troublers of Israel" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2Thessalonians 1:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - A<span class="cmt_word">nd another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud;</span> <span class="accented">another angel</span>; in addition to those already mentioned, not implying that he who sat on the cloud was an angel. <span class="accented">Out of the temple</span>, or <span class="accented">shrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); the inner sanctuary of God (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>).
