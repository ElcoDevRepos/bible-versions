In the context of Revelation, this earthquake symbolizes a significant act of God intervening in human history. Earthquakes are mentioned in other prophetic contexts, such as in <a href="/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>, where they are signs of the end times. The timing, "in that hour," suggests immediacy and divine precision in the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>and a tenth of the city collapsed</b><br>The city likely refers to Jerusalem, a central location in biblical prophecy. The fraction "a tenth" may symbolize a partial but significant judgment, reminiscent of the tithe, which is a tenth given to God, indicating a portion set apart. This partial destruction could signify a call to repentance for the remaining inhabitants, aligning with the theme of God's mercy amidst judgment.<p><b>Seven thousand were killed in the quake</b><br>The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in biblical literature. The specific number "seven thousand" may indicate a complete and divinely ordained judgment upon those who perished. This echoes the Old Testament, where specific numbers often carry symbolic weight, such as in <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, where God preserves seven thousand in Israel who have not bowed to Baal.<p><b>and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven</b><br>The reaction of fear and giving glory to God suggests a recognition of divine authority and power. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's mighty acts lead to acknowledgment of His sovereignty, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>, where the Israelites feared the Lord and believed in Him after witnessing the destruction of the Egyptian army. The phrase "God of heaven" emphasizes His supreme authority over all creation, a title used in <a href="/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18-19</a>, highlighting God's control over earthly events. This acknowledgment may indicate a moment of repentance or realization among the survivors, aligning with the theme of God's desire for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_earthquake.htm">The Great Earthquake</a></b><br>A significant seismic event symbolizing divine intervention and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Likely Jerusalem, representing a center of religious and political significance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenth_of_the_city.htm">The Tenth of the City</a></b><br>A portion of the city that collapses, indicating partial but significant destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_thousand_killed.htm">Seven Thousand Killed</a></b><br>A specific number of people who perish, symbolizing completeness in judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rest_who_gave_glory.htm">The Rest Who Gave Glory</a></b><br>Survivors who respond with fear and reverence, acknowledging God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_mercy.htm">Divine Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>God's judgments are both just and merciful, leading some to repentance and acknowledgment of His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>Earthquakes symbolize God's immense power and control over creation, reminding us of His sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/response_to_god's_acts.htm">Response to God's Acts</a></b><br>The appropriate response to witnessing God's power is reverence and giving glory to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/partial_judgment_as_a_warning.htm">Partial Judgment as a Warning</a></b><br>The partial destruction serves as a warning and a call to repentance for those who survive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_fear_in_faith.htm">The Role of Fear in Faith</a></b><br>Healthy fear of God can lead to a deeper faith and recognition of His authority.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_11_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 11:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_11_13_God_s_power_shown.htm">How does Revelation 11:13 demonstrate God's power and authority over creation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_a_tenth_of_the_city_important.htm">What is the significance of "a tenth of the city" falling?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Fear_of_God_leading_to_repentance.htm">How can fear of God lead to repentance, as seen in Revelation 11:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/OT_events_like_Rev_11_13_earthquake.htm">What Old Testament events parallel the earthquake in Revelation 11:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_God_s_judgments.htm">How should believers respond to God's judgments in their personal lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_11_13_God_s_judgment_mercy.htm">What does Revelation 11:13 reveal about God's judgment and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Earthquake_in_Rev_11_13_as_divine_sign.htm">How does the earthquake in Revelation 11:13 symbolize divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_only_1_10_of_the_city_fall.htm">Why do only a tenth of the city fall in Revelation 11:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_three_woes_in_revelation.htm">What are the three woes in Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_end_times'_delusion.htm">What is the end times' strong delusion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_ride_a_white_horse_in_revelation.htm">Is Jesus depicted riding a white horse in Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_interpretation_and_application_differ.htm">What does 42 months symbolize in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 11:13 Mean</div><b>And in that hour</b><p>The phrase signals an immediate follow-up to the ascension of the two witnesses (<a href="/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11-12</a>).

The targeted severity underscores God&#8217;s controlled judgment&#8212;enough to shake but not annihilate. Survivors, gripped by holy fear, publicly honor &#8220;the God of heaven,&#8221; illustrating that divine discipline aims at awakening hearts. The verse thus affirms God&#8217;s sovereign power, His righteous justice, and His merciful invitation to repentance even in the midst of end-time upheaval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And the same hour . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And in that hour there was</span> (took place) <span class= "ital">a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and, there were slain in the earthquake names of men seven thousand: and the rest became affrighted, and gave glory to the God of the heaven.</span> The hour of their triumph is the hour of a retributive warning on the city where they were slain convulsion, with the overthrow of dwellings and the death of seven thousand men.

The visible Church of Christ is stirred; there is a reaction from the spirit of worldliness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the same hour was there a great earthquake.</span> In the visions of the seals it is set forth, under the sixth seal, how the destruction of the world is accompanied by earthquakes, etc.; the fear of the wicked is portrayed, and the preservation of the just takes place at the same time. Here, under the sixth trumpet, we have the same events shown forth, the triumph of the godly being mentioned first, though the rest happens "in that same hour." This is the conclusion of the sixth judgment, the consequence of the non repentance mentioned in <a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>. The intervening narrative (<a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:12</a>) serves to show that opportunities of knowing God's will are given to men, as well as warnings of judgment in ease of disobedience. Vers. 13 of <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. might follow <a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>, but for the desire of the seer to demonstrate the long suffering goodness and mercy of God. And the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand. Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version have in the margin, "names of men, seven thousand," and some writers make much of the expression. Thus Alford says, "As if the name of each were recounted;" and Wordsworth, "Persons known and distinguished." But, in truth, the phrase is a Hebraism, to which we can attach no special significance (cf. <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). Whatever may he the system of interpretation adopted, this passage presents many difficulties. The whole account appears to relate to the judgment day, and it is therefore more peculiarly prophetic than many parts of the Apocalypse, and for that reason its meaning must needs be more or less obscure. The account in this verse informs us that a part (a tenth) of the city (that is, of the wicked) suffers destruction; that the number so destroyed is described as seven thousand; that the rest (nine tenths), in fear, recognize the power of God, to which they had hitherto refused attention. What is the final fate awarded to the nine tenths we are not told. We have, therefore, to inquire the meaning of the numbers given. Now, it seems inherently impossible to interpret these numbers literally, and, moreover, as we have repeatedly seen, it is not the habit of the writer of the Apocalypse to indicate exact numbers. We must, therefore, try to discover the symbolical meaning which St. John attached to these expressions, the qualities rather than the quantities which he intended to signify. In the Bible <span class="accented">the tenth part</span> invariably signifies the tithe - the portion due from the community to God or to the ruler (cf. <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm">Leviticus 27:32</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15, 17</a>). it seems probable that this was the idea intended to be conveyed, viz. that God was now exacting his due, that men who had refused to recognize what was due from them to God were now forced to recognize his sovereignty by the exaction for punishment of a tithe, and as an evidence that all are under his sway. But, it may be objected, are not all the wicked punished at the judgment? This verse really seems to hint at a possibility of some course by which, even at the last moment, a chance of escape may be presented to men. But it does not distinctly state this; it seems, indeed, purposely to leave the fate of the rest of the ungodly untold. All it does assert is that God comes to the wicked as a Conqueror or a King, and exacts what is due to himself. But, further, why are <span class="accented">seven thousand</span> men slain? Again interpreting symbolically, <span class="accented">seven</span> involves the idea of completeness (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). A thousand signifies a large number, though not an infinitely large number, for which we have "thousands of thousands," etc. This number, therefore, informs us that God's vengeance overtakes a large number, and that that number is complete, none escaping who deserve to be included. Perhaps this is mentioned as a precaution against any possibility of mistake in the interpretation of the "tenth part." It is as though St. John would say, "In that hour God exacted vengeance, demanding what was due to his justice; but do not imagine that that vengeance reached only a small part of mankind. It was far extending and complete, though I do not attempt to define its exact limits, which cannot be known until the judgment day itself shall reveal everything." <span class="cmt_word">And the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="accented">The rest gave glory</span>, being, perhaps (though not necessarily), repentant (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>). Possibly we have here a hint of God's uncovenanted mercies (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), though there is nothing sufficiently definite to encourage men to postpone the day of repentance. No mention is made of the ultimate fate of "the remnant." "The God of heaven," in contrast to things of the world, upon which their affections had been hitherto set (cf. <a href="/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a>). In these two places alone of the New Testament is this expression found; but it is not uncommon in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
