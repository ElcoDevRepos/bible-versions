The act of turning signifies a deliberate response to a divine call, reminiscent of Moses turning aside to see the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3-4</a>). The "voice" is a central theme in prophetic literature, often representing divine communication (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>). In the context of Revelation, this voice is authoritative and commands attention, suggesting the presence of Christ Himself, as seen in the subsequent verses.<p><b>And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,</b><br>The "seven golden lampstands" are symbolic and hold significant meaning. In the ancient Near East, lampstands were used in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>), representing the presence of God and the light of His truth. The number seven is often associated with completeness and perfection in biblical literature (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15-16</a>). In Revelation, these lampstands are later identified as the seven churches (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>), indicating their role as bearers of God's light in the world. The use of gold signifies purity and value, underscoring the precious nature of the church in God's eyes. This imagery connects to Jesus' teaching about believers being the light of the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>) and highlights the church's mission to reflect Christ's light.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who is receiving the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_golden_lampstands.htm">Seven Golden Lampstands</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of the seven churches in Asia Minor, which are addressed in the subsequent chapters of Revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice.htm">Voice</a></b><br>The voice that John hears is later revealed to be that of Jesus Christ, who is delivering a message to the churches.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lampstands symbolize the churches as bearers of God's light in a dark world.

And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2-11</a>. It has been observed that there is a difference in the two visions. In Zech., as in <a href="/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-32</a>, the seven branches are united, so as to form one candlestick; here there are said to be seven candlesticks; and from this supposed difference it is argued that we have a hint of the variety of the Christian churches, as distinguished from the singleness of the Jewish church. But is it not more probable that what St. John saw was the old familiar seven-branched candlestick, identical in form with that which has been rendered familiar to all by the Arch of Titus, but that as the mention of the seven churches was then fresh in his mind, his eye fell rather upon the seven limbs and seven lights than on the whole candlestand, especially if, as Prof. Plumptre suggests, the figure of the Christ concealed part of the main stem? Thus to his view the separate individuality of the churches, and their real union in Him who was the Light, would rather be symbolised. Thus, too, the external teachings of the earlier symbols are not disturbed: the new revelation illumines the types and shadows of the older. "These symbols were intended to raise them out of symbols; the truths were to throw light on the parables, rather than the parables on the truths. Men were to study the visions of an earlier day by the revelations of that day" (Maurice, <span class= "ital">Apocalypse, </span>p. 22).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To see the voice</span>. As in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>, "the voice" is put for the speaker. This is the right method in studying the Revelation; we must, like St. John, "turn to see the voice." We must look, not to the events about which it seems to us to speak, but to him who utters it. The book is "the Revelation," not of the secrets of history, but "of Jesus Christ." Seven golden candlesticks. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>; <a href="/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a>; <a href="/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>; and seven times in this book. In <a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>:37 we have seven <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> on one <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, seven lamps on one lamp stand. So also in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>. It is by no means certain that a similar figure is not meant here; the seven-branched candlestick familiar to all who know the Arch of Titus. If the Christ stood "in the midst of the candlesticks," his form would appear as that which united the seven branches. But it is perhaps more natural to understand seven separate lamp stands, each with its own lamp; and these, in contrast with the seven-branched stand of the temple, may represent the elastic multiplicity of the Christian Churches throughout the world in contrast with the rigid unity of the Jewish Church of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I turned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(epestrepsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1994.htm">Strong's 1994: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and strepho; to revert.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to see</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(blepein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_991.htm">Strong's 991: </a> </span><span class="str2">(primarily physical), I look, see, perceive, discern.
