Their act of falling down signifies deep reverence and submission to divine authority. This imagery echoes the worship practices in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where prostration was a common gesture of homage to a king or deity. The One seated on the throne is God, depicted as the sovereign ruler of the universe, a theme consistent throughout Revelation and other apocalyptic literature.<p><b>and they worship Him who lives forever and ever</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of God, a central tenet in Christian theology. The act of worship here is not just a ritual but an acknowledgment of God's unending existence and supreme power. The phrase "forever and ever" is a common biblical expression denoting eternity, found in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> and <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>, reinforcing the idea of God's timeless dominion.<p><b>They cast their crowns before the throne</b><br>Casting crowns is a symbolic act of surrendering authority and honor back to God, recognizing that all power and glory ultimately belong to Him. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, crowns were symbols of victory and status. By laying their crowns before the throne, the elders demonstrate that their victories and honors are derived from and belong to God. This act parallels the Christian teaching of humility and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over all creation.<p><b>saying:</b><br>The introduction of speech indicates that what follows is a declaration or hymn of praise. In the context of Revelation, such proclamations often serve to affirm God's attributes and deeds, contributing to the book's overarching theme of divine worship and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty-four_elders.htm">Twenty-Four Elders</a></b><br>These figures are often interpreted as representing the fullness of God's people, possibly symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.
