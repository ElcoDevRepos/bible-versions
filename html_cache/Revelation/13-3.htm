The imagery of a "head" often represents authority or leadership. The mortal wound implies a severe, potentially fatal blow, which could be interpreted as a political or military defeat. Historically, this has been linked to the Roman Empire, which experienced significant upheavals and appeared to be on the brink of collapse. Theologically, this could also symbolize a false resurrection, mimicking the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thus serving as a counterfeit to divine power.<p><b>But the mortal wound was healed,</b><br>The healing of the mortal wound indicates a restoration or revival of power. This could be seen as a resurgence of a fallen empire or leader, suggesting a return to prominence and influence. In a prophetic context, this healing can be viewed as a deceptive miracle, designed to lead people astray. It reflects the theme of false signs and wonders that are prevalent in apocalyptic literature, warning believers to discern true divine acts from those that are counterfeit.<p><b>and the whole world marveled and followed the beast.</b><br>The global reaction of marveling and following the beast highlights the widespread influence and appeal of this power. This suggests a charismatic or compelling nature that captivates the masses, leading to widespread allegiance. In a historical context, this could reflect the Roman Empire's dominance and the allure of its culture and power. Biblically, this serves as a warning against idolatry and the dangers of following worldly powers instead of remaining faithful to God.

One of these heads&#8212;one specific ruler within a final, God-permitted confederation&#8212;draws special attention. <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8, 23</a>-25 pictures a similar end-time empire, giving us reason to understand this beast literally as the Antichrist and his revived geopolitical system.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Appeared to have been mortally wounded</b><p>John sees the head &#8220;appeared to have been mortally wounded&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The language points to a deathblow&#8212;so severe that observers assume the leader is beyond recovery.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a> hints at a violent strike against a false shepherd, and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a> speaks of the &#8220;man of lawlessness&#8221; who meets opposition before rising to worldwide dominance.<p>&#8226; The wording &#8220;appeared&#8221; leaves room for either an actual death or a deceptive staging.

The passage warns believers to hold fast to the true risen Lamb, recognizing that end-time deception will hinge on counterfeit signs designed to mimic and replace the glory that belongs to Christ alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And I</span> <span class= "bld">saw . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And </span>(<span class= "ital">I saw</span>)<span class= "ital"> one from among his heads as if having been slain</span> [the expression is the same as that applied to the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a> : the wound marks are there when the vision rises] <span class= "ital">unto death; and the stroke of his death was healed.</span> When the wild beast rose from the sea, the seer saw the deadly wound on the head: the wound was really unto death; the beast which had waged war against the true kingdom of righteousness and faith has received his death-blow. This is the historical point from which the vision starts. This being so, the death-blow is that which has just been dealt: the seed of the woman has bruised the serpent's head. The blow which casts down the dragon inflicts a deadly wound upon the wild beast, which is his agent. When Christ overthrew the wicked one He gave the death-blow to the world-power--to all systems founded on passion, or self-sufficiency, or inhumanity. But the death-blow is apparently healed. What is this but telling the Church of Christ that the fruits of Christ's victory will not be seen without delay? The world-power is smitten unto death; but the actual death does not follow immediately. The power of evil, contrary to all expectation, rises with new vigour. This revived power showed itself, with more or less force, in the way in which the spirit of the wild beast broke forth when Christianity seemed to have put fetters on the Roman empire.<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">And all the world wondered . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And the whole earth wondered after the wild beast, and worshipped the dragon, because he gave the authority and worshipped the wild beast, saying, Who is like unto the wild beast? and who is able to war with him?</span> The healing of the death-blow causes wonder to all. Their wonder leads to worship. The spirit of the wild beast is adored wherever worldliness prevails. There is nothing so successful as success, and the homage of men is more often paid to power than to principle. "Who is like unto the beast?" The words are a parody, and a blasphemous parody, on the ascription of praise to God which the name Michael imported. (See <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>; comp. Psalms 112, <a href="/micah/7-18.htm" title="Who is a God like to you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.">Micah 7:18</a>.) "Who is like unto God?" is the legend of the saints: the opposing cry is, "Who is like unto the beast?"<p>"Can you not hear the words coming across the centuries from the lips of two Roman youths talking with each other, as they lounge together in the Forum?" (Maurice.) Can we not hear the echo of the words in the Champs Elysees, in Piccadilly, in the Broadway, or Unter Den Linden, from the lips of young men who have taken fashion, rank, wealth, world-power in any shape, as their god?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed;</span> <span class="accented">and one of his heads as though it had been slain unto death</span>; <span class="accented">and his death stroke was healed.</span> The writer wishes to express the coexistence of two mutually antagonistic qualities. The head had received a fatal wound, and yet the beast continued to exist and exert his power. There may be a contrast and a comparison intended between the Lamb, as it had been slain, worshipped by his adoring followers, and the beast, usurping the honour due to Christ, imitating him even in the respect of having been slain, and exacting homage from those who "wondered after the beast." But the "head smitten unto death" must still possess some special significance of its own. What that is we are not plainly told; but it seems reasonable to refer it to the blow dealt to the power of Satan by the death and resurrection of Christ. It almost seemed at first as though the power of the world must succumb to the influence of the life and death of our Lord, and for a time great progress was made in the increase of the number of believers (cf. <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41, 47</a>). But the power of the world was not yet destroyed; it continued to exist in spite of the seemingly fatal wound. Some see in this account a reference to the destruction of the Roman pagan empire, and the establishment of the Christian empire. Others believe the blow to be that administered by Michael, when Satan was ejected from heaven. Others refer the wounded head to different individuals; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nero. That <span class="accented">one head</span> is wounded out of the seven probably denotes the partial nature of the wound as visible to an observer. <span class="cmt_word">And all the world wondered after the beast</span>; <span class="accented">the whole earth wondered after the beast.</span> The pregnant construction.
