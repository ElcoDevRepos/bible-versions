The leopard's spots may symbolize the diverse and multicultural nature of the empire, reflecting the rapid expansion and assimilation of various cultures. This beast represents a kingdom or power that is both swift in conquest and diverse in its composition.<p><b>with the feet of a bear</b><br>The bear's feet indicate strength and stability, reminiscent of the Medo-Persian Empire described in <a href="/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. The bear's powerful feet suggest a kingdom that is grounded and formidable, capable of crushing its enemies. This imagery conveys the idea of a power that is both enduring and capable of exerting significant force.<p><b>and the mouth of a lion</b><br>The lion's mouth symbolizes authority and dominance, akin to the Babylonian Empire, as depicted in <a href="/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>. The lion is often seen as the king of beasts, representing a kingdom with a commanding presence and the ability to instill fear.

This indicates a satanic influence behind the beast's actions and rule. The transfer of power from the dragon to the beast signifies a counterfeit authority, mimicking the divine authority given to Christ. This connection highlights the spiritual battle between good and evil, with the beast serving as an agent of the dragon's will on earth. The imagery underscores the theme of deception and the usurpation of legitimate authority, as the beast seeks to establish a kingdom in opposition to God's rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic creature representing a powerful, oppressive kingdom or empire.

John is witnessing a literal, future political power&#8212;personified in one man&#8212;who will dominate the last days. Notice:<p>&#8226; Like Daniel&#8217;s four beasts, this single figure blends traits of several kingdoms, showing a final empire that absorbs all the strength of its predecessors (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal pronouns used throughout the chapter (&#8220;he,&#8221; &#8220;him&#8221;) emphasize an actual leader, not merely an idea (<a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was like a leopard</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;was like a leopard&#8230;&#8221; points to the swift, unexpected manner in which this ruler conquers.

This coming leader:<p>&#8226; Speaks boastful, blasphemous words against God (<a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Uses persuasive, awe-inspiring rhetoric to rally the world (<a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Echoes the devil&#8217;s own intimidating roar (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), revealing his source.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the dragon gave the beast his power</b><p>&#8220;And the dragon gave the beast his power&#8230;&#8221; ties the vision directly to Satan. In the previous chapter the dragon is identified as &#8220;that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>). Here:<p>&#8226; The Antichrist&#8217;s supernatural abilities come from satanic empowerment (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; This transfer of power is a counterfeit of the Father granting authority to the Son (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), underscoring Satan&#8217;s desire to imitate and usurp God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his throne and great authority</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and his throne and great authority.&#8221; The dragon not only supplies power but also places the beast in a ruling seat:<p>&#8226; He inherits a literal throne&#8212;global governmental control (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Great authority&#8221; means the world willingly submits (<a href="/luke/4-6.htm">Luke 4:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This explains why worship of the beast merges with worship of the dragon (<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>): political allegiance becomes spiritual idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a> sketches a single end-times ruler whose empire blends the speed of a leopard, the strength of a bear, and the fierce voice of a lion. Each trait mirrors earlier Gentile kingdoms in Daniel, showing a culmination of human rebellion. Satan, portrayed as the dragon, openly empowers this leader, granting him power, a throne, and worldwide authority. The verse assures us that the coming Antichrist&#8217;s dominance is real, global, and diabolically energized&#8212;but it also reminds us that every borrowed throne is temporary, soon to be shattered by the everlasting kingdom of Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And the beast . . .</span>--The wild beast combined the features of three wild animals: the leopard, the bear, the lion. In Daniel's vision (<a href="/daniel/7-4.htm" title="The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.">Daniel 7:4</a>) the kingdoms were described: the first, like a lion; the second, like a bear; the third, like a leopard or panther. Here all these features are combined, because the wild beast is a representative of all forms of world-power, which have been swift to shed blood: like a leopard leaping on the prey, tenacious and relentless as a bear, and all devouring (their throat is an open sepulchre) as a lion. The reader will remember the wild beasts which in vision hindered Dante when he sought to ascend the "pleasant mount"--the "cause and source of all delight." The leopard, the lion, the wolf were symbols of luxuriousness, cruel ambition, and hungry and heartless avarice, which oppose men and nations when they seek the Holy Hill, where the light of God ever rests. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Inferno, </span>i. 10-74)<p><span class= "bld">And the dragon.</span>--Read, <span class= "ital">And the dragon gave him his power and his throne</span> (not his "seat," as in the English version; it is the royal seat, the throne, which is meant). (See Notes on <a href="/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And great authority.</span>--It is through this succession of world-powers that the dragon carries on his war. The wild beast becomes the vicegerent, so to speak, of the prince of this world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</span> The similarity to the vision of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. is very evident; the resemblance extending even to the language, which is here very like the LXX. version of Daniel. Cf. especially the form <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (found in all the best manuscripts) with that of the LXX. of <a href="/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. In the vision of Daniel four beasts are seen rising from the sea. The first was like a <span class="accented">lion</span>, the second like a <span class="accented">bear</span>, the third like a <span class="accented">leopard</span>, the fourth was distinguished by the <span class="accented">ten horns.</span> Here the four are combined in the one appearance of the beast. The qualities which are indicated by the animals named are very generally agreed upon. The <span class="accented">lion</span> denotes lordly dominion and rule; the <span class="accented">bear</span> suggests crushing force and tenacity of purpose; the <span class="accented">leopard</span> is distinguished for its swiftness and cruel blood thirstiness. These characteristics marked the Roman empire at the time of this vision, and this probably was the first fulfilment of the vision. The same qualities have, however, been exhibited at all times by the persecutors of the Church of God, and thus the application may be extended, and the vision represents (as Alford says) "not the Roman empire merely, but the aggregate of the empires of this world as opposed to Christ and his kingdom." <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority;</span> <span class="accented">and his throne.</span> The dragon and this beast are essentially one, since the latter wields all the influence of the former. The devil lost his throne in heaven; through the power of the world he temporarily regains a throne as the "prince of this world." Christ, by his incarnation, destroyed much of the personal nature of the devil's influence over men. By that the devil was completely bound as regards the righteous (cf. the interpretation of <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>); but his power to work mischief he transfers to the nations of the world, who become his instrument for that purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
