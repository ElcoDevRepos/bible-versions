The imagery of blood signifies guilt and responsibility for the persecution and martyrdom of God's messengers. Prophets and saints refer to those who have been faithful to God's word throughout history. This echoes Jesus' lament over Jerusalem in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>, where He speaks of the city that kills the prophets. The historical context suggests a pattern of opposition to divine truth, seen in both Old and New Testament narratives.<p><b>and of all who had been slain on the earth</b><br>This broadens the scope of the indictment to include all innocent bloodshed, suggesting a systemic and pervasive culture of violence and injustice. It reflects the cumulative guilt of a society that has consistently rejected God's ways. This phrase connects to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where Abel's blood cries out from the ground, symbolizing divine awareness and judgment of human violence.

It is not meant that literally all the blood shed by violence had been shed by Rome, or any other single city of which Babylon is type: all that is meant is that Babylon, the world city, is founded on those principles, the logical outcome of which is violence, bloodshed, and hostility to the highest right: those who die by her hands, few or many, are the evidence that the whole tendency of her power is against holiness and truth. In the earthly view, we are guilty of the acts we do: in the heavenly view, we are guilty of all that the spirit and sin of our conduct tends to do. The spirit of transgression is seen in one act as well as in many, and as it is the attitude of the spirit that God looks upon, so in a single act may be gathered up the transgression of the whole law. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/17-6.htm" title="And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.">Revelation 17:6</a>, and Note there; see also <a href="/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>). It is the fatal failure to perceive this which leads man to make light of sin, and to undervalue the Cross of Christ.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</span> At first sight it seems difficult to understand that these words are spoken not only of Babylon, but of the faithless portion of the Church, symbolized by the harlot.
