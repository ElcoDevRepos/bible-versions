The "children" are likely her followers or those who adopt her practices. The imagery of striking dead is reminiscent of Old Testament judgments, such as those against the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). It underscores the seriousness of spiritual adultery and the divine judgment that follows. This serves as a warning to the early church and believers today about the dangers of false teachings and the importance of remaining faithful to Christ.<p><b>and all the churches will know</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the public nature of God's judgment. The early Christian communities were interconnected, and news of such divine actions would spread quickly among them. This serves as a reminder that God's actions are not only corrective but also instructive, teaching the broader church about His holiness and justice. It reflects the communal aspect of the early church, where the actions of one congregation could impact others.<p><b>that I am the One who searches minds and hearts</b><br>This statement highlights Christ's divine omniscience, echoing Old Testament passages like <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>, where God searches the heart and tests the mind. It affirms that Christ possesses the same divine attributes as God the Father, reinforcing His deity. This knowledge of the inner thoughts and intentions of individuals serves as both a comfort and a warning, assuring believers that nothing is hidden from Him.<p><b>and I will repay each of you according to your deeds</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of divine retribution, where individuals are rewarded or punished based on their actions. It aligns with passages such as <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a> and <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>, which speak of God rendering to each person according to their works.

The term &#8220;children&#8221; points to her followers&#8212;people who have adopted her immoral teaching.<p>&#8226; The warning is literal: Christ Himself will intervene with decisive judgment, even physical death, to halt the spread of sin (compare <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Such discipline is an act of holiness and love, protecting the wider church from corruption and underscoring that God takes unrepentant sin seriously (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the churches will know that I am the One who searches minds and hearts</b><p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s judgment serves as a public testimony to every congregation: He alone sees below the surface, discerning thoughts and intentions (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; No one can hide behind outward religiosity; the Lord weighs motives as well as actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all the churches&#8221; shows that local discipline has universal significance.
