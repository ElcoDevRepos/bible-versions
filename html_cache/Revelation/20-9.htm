The "broad expanse of the earth" suggests a global scale, indicating the widespread nature of this final rebellion against God. This imagery echoes the gathering of nations in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a>, where Gog and Magog are mentioned, symbolizing a coalition of forces opposed to God. The phrase emphasizes the vastness and the seemingly overwhelming power of the enemy, yet it also sets the stage for their ultimate defeat.<p><b>and surrounded the camp of the saints</b><br>The "camp of the saints" refers to the people of God, who are set apart and protected by Him. In the Old Testament, the camp was a place of safety and divine presence, as seen in the Israelites' encampment during their wilderness journey. This imagery suggests that the saints are under God's protection, even when surrounded by adversaries. The term "saints" highlights the holiness and dedication of God's people, who are often depicted as a remnant in biblical prophecy.<p><b>and the beloved city.</b><br>The "beloved city" is commonly understood to be Jerusalem, a city of great significance throughout biblical history. Jerusalem is often portrayed as the center of God's earthly kingdom and the focal point of His redemptive plan. In prophetic literature, it symbolizes the dwelling place of God with His people. The term "beloved" underscores God's special affection and covenant relationship with Jerusalem, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/87-2.htm">Psalm 87:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>.<p><b>But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.</b><br>This phrase depicts the swift and decisive judgment of God upon the rebellious forces. Fire from heaven is a recurring motif in Scripture, symbolizing divine judgment and purification, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). The immediate consumption of the enemies highlights God's sovereign power and the futility of opposing Him. This act of judgment fulfills prophetic themes of God's ultimate victory over evil, as foretold in passages like <a href="/zechariah/14-12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_armies_of_satan.htm">The Armies of Satan</a></b><br>These are the forces gathered by Satan after his release from the abyss, representing the ultimate rebellion against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_the_saints.htm">The Camp of the Saints</a></b><br>This symbolizes the community of believers who are faithful to God, often interpreted as the Church or the people of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved_city.htm">The Beloved City</a></b><br>Commonly understood as Jerusalem, this represents the spiritual center of God's people and His covenant promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire_from_heaven.htm">Fire from Heaven</a></b><br>This is a divine intervention, symbolizing God's judgment and protection over His people, reminiscent of Old Testament instances where God intervenes with fire.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The broad expanse of the earth signifies the global scope of the final rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>Despite the overwhelming forces against them, the saints are protected by God's sovereign power.

It has waged its spiritual warfare against all forms of evil, Its citizens, like the returned exiles (<a href="/context/nehemiah/4-17.htm" title="They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.">Nehemiah 4:17-18</a>), could never lay down the sword (comp. <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>; <a href="/john/5-4.htm" title="For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.">John 5:4</a>); but the hostile demonstration is arrested by divine intervention. <span class= "ital">There came down fire out of the heaven</span> (the words "from God" are of doubtful authority) <span class= "ital">and devoured them.</span> The Shechinah light tabernacled over the holy city. Its light was also a flame ready to break forth upon the wicked. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm" title="His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm" title="Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.">Revelation 7:15</a>, Note; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a>; <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2Thessalonians 1:6-10</a>.) There may be allusion to the overthrow of the cities of the plains (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm" title="Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;">Genesis 19:24</a>), but other incidents may have been in the prophet's mind: the fire which fell from heaven upon the enemies of an earlier prophet, Elijah (<a href="/context/2_kings/1-9.htm" title="Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.">2Kings 1:9-14</a>), and the fire which broke forth from the tabernacle in the wilderness upon those who defied the laws of the God of Israel (<a href="/context/numbers/16-16.htm" title="And Moses said to Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:">Numbers 16:16-17</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-35.htm" title="And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.">Numbers 16:35</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/10-1.htm" title="And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). It must be remembered that, in the passage before us, the prophet is using the incidents and actions of the past as imagery, and that the present vision is figurative, though of course not mere empty figure: for Christ will thoroughly purge His floor (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went up on the breadth cf the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city;</span> <span class="accented">over the breadth.</span> "They went up" as an army to attack the enemy (cf. <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>). Either we must render <span class="accented">the camp</span>... <span class="accented">even the beloved city</span>, or else we must understand the <span class="accented">camp</span> as a defensive outpost placed around or near the city. In <a href="/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34</a> the same word is rendered "castle." "The beloved city" is evidently Jerusalem (of <a href="/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68</a>), that is, the Church of God, of which it is always a type in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The description plainly portrays the Church militant here on earth. <span class="cmt_word">And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</span>. "From God" is omitted in A, a few cursives, and Primasius, but appears in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, l, 7, and most cursives and versions; but these authorities vary in the position of the added clause. So in <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. fire devours the enemies of the two witnesses. This sentence is introduced in connection with the description of Gog and Magog, following the account of Ezekiel, where the same punishment is foretold (see <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>). It is probable, therefore, that nothing more definite is intended than to convey the general idea that God aids and protects his Church even while on earth. He, as it were, gives the enemies of his people a foretaste, while here on earth, of their future punishment of the lake of fire (see also on the seal visions). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they marched across</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#946;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aneb&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_305.htm">Strong's 305: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go up, mount, ascend; of things: I rise, spring up, come up.
