The concept of blasphemy is significant in biblical texts, often associated with speaking against God or claiming divine status (<a href="/mark/2-7.htm">Mark 2:7</a>, <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>). The beast's arrogance mirrors the pride of historical figures like Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>) and the little horn in <a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, which also speaks boastfully. This suggests a recurring theme of human or demonic powers challenging divine authority. The granting of a mouth implies that this ability is allowed by God, aligning with the biblical theme of divine sovereignty over all events, even those involving evil (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>, <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><b>and authority to act for 42 months</b><br>The period of 42 months, equivalent to three and a half years, is a significant timeframe in apocalyptic literature, often symbolizing a limited period of tribulation or persecution (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25, 12</a>:7; <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 12</a>:6). This duration is half of seven, a number symbolizing completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting that the beast's reign is divinely limited and incomplete. Historically, this period may reflect the time of intense persecution faced by early Christians under Roman emperors, such as Nero or Domitian. Theologically, it points to a future time of trial before the ultimate victory of Christ, echoing the trials faced by the faithful throughout biblical history. The authority given to the beast is temporary, underscoring the ultimate sovereignty of God and the eventual triumph of His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15, 19</a>:11-21).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of a powerful, oppressive entity or system that opposes God and His people.

The 5th verse tells us that the liberty to speak and work <span class= "ital">was given</span> to him. There is consolation in the words: he has no power beyond what is given; behind his reckless and apparently irresistible power there stands the veiled but real power of God. "Thou couldest have no power" (the saints may take up their Lord's words) "against me, except it were given thee from above." He speaks great things, and blasphemy. <span class= "ital">And there was given him authority to act</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">to do</span>)<span class= "ital"> forty-two months.</span> Again the familiar period, the limited time of the world-power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies. So the horn which sprang from the fourth beast of <a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a> had given to it "a mouth speaking great things." The power of the beast is, after all, only held by the consent of God, who for his own good purpose permits him to exercise it for a time. The "great things" are the promises of superior power and good, with which the devil seeks to allure men, as he did Adam and Eve at the first. All attempts to decry God's omnipotence and the power of Christ are <span class="accented">blasphemies. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And power was given unto him to continue forty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">two months;</span> or, <span class="accented">to work forty and two months.</span> Again note the power is given to him; that is, he holds it only subject to the will of God. The "forty and two months," or three years and a half, signify the period of the world's existence. (For a full discussion of the subject, see on Revelation 11:2.) It is the "little time" of <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10, 11</a>, during which will be fulfilled the number of the saints. It is the "little season" of <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan is "loosed," that is, during which he has this power to work given to him (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>).
