The voice from heaven signifies authority and truth, often associated with God's direct communication. The command to "write" underscores the importance of preserving this message for future generations, similar to other instances in Scripture where prophets are instructed to document divine revelations (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Blessed are the dead&#8212;those who die in the Lord from this moment on.&#8221;</b><br>The term "blessed" reflects a state of divine favor and happiness, often used in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>). "The dead&#8212;those who die in the Lord" refers to believers who have remained faithful to Christ until death. The phrase "from this moment on" suggests a specific time of increased persecution or tribulation, possibly linked to the events described in Revelation. This blessing assures believers of their eternal reward and contrasts with the fate of those who reject God.<p><b>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says the Spirit</b><br>The affirmation by the Spirit emphasizes the certainty and truth of the blessing. The Holy Spirit, as the third person of the Trinity, is often depicted as a comforter and guide for believers (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). This agreement by the Spirit highlights the divine endorsement of the message and the assurance of rest for the faithful.<p><b>&#8220;they will rest from their labors</b><br>The promise of rest is a recurring biblical theme, symbolizing peace and relief from earthly struggles. This rest is reminiscent of the Sabbath rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>) and the ultimate rest in God's presence. The "labors" refer to the trials and efforts of living a faithful Christian life, often marked by persecution and hardship, as seen in the early church's experiences.<p><b>for their deeds will follow them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates that the actions and faithfulness of believers have eternal significance. It echoes the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, where good deeds done in faith are rewarded by God. The idea that deeds "follow" suggests that they have lasting impact and are remembered by God, aligning with the concept of rewards in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div

The Holy Spirit confirms it. Their suffering ends in immediate rest, and every act of faithfulness travels with them to God&#8217;s throne, ensuring eternal reward. The verse calls every reader to steadfast hope, knowing that not one moment of costly obedience will ever be wasted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13)<span class= "bld">And I heard a voice . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And I heard a voice out of the heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, in that they shall rest from their labours; for their works follow with them.</span> We are not told whose voice speaks, but it proclaims a blessing on (not only martyrs, but) those who die in the Lord, in happy union and fellowship with Him (<a href="/context/john/15-2.htm" title="Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.">John 15:2-5</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>); such are happy, for they rest from toil, and their works of faith and labours of love (even if only the giving a cup of cold water in the name of Christ) follow with them into the presence of their Lord (<a href="/context/matthew/10-41.htm" title="He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.">Matthew 10:41-42</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>). The words "from henceforth" form a difficulty; the reason for their introduction is to be found in the state of trouble which the last verses describe: the righteous are happy in being taken away from the evil to come. Or may it be that the words are designed to console the mourners in an age when dark unbelief robs away the sweet resurrection trust, and writes over its graves, "Farewell for ever"? If the climax of world-power should be bitter scorn of the idea of a life to come, and complacent satisfaction with a portion in this world, then words of faith, proclaiming that the dead are happy and restful, and that their work is not in vain in the Lord, may find new force to sustain a fainting courage or a wavering trust.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me.</span> It seems most natural to suppose that the voice is that of the angel who directs the visions of St. John (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9, 10</a>), but there is no certainty in the matter. Omit "unto me." with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and others. <span class="cmt_word">Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.</span> "Henceforth" should probably stand thus, and not in connection with the following sentence. We have just had mentioned the necessity for patience on the part of the saints; here we have an encouragement and incentive to that patience, inasmuch as they who die in the Lord are henceforward blessed. In what their blessedness consists, the next sentence slates. The full consummation of their bliss may not occur until after the judgment, but the faithful have not to wait until then for peace; their conflict is, after all, only for this life, and thus they may well be content to suffer for so short a period (comp. <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them;</span> <span class="accented">that they shall rest</span>... <span class="accented">for their works</span>, etc. The first part explains the "blessedness" of the previous passage; in this <span class="accented">rest</span> consists their blessedness. The last clause, "for their works," etc., explains why the blessedness consists in rest; they have henceforth no need of labours, for the effects of their former works accompany them and permit them now complete rest. Contrast the opposite fate of the wicked, described in ver. 11. St. Paul urges upon Christians the same duty, and proffers the same encouragement: "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
