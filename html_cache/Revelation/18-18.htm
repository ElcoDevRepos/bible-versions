The imagery of smoke rising is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>), where smoke was a sign of divine judgment. The fire consuming her indicates total destruction, aligning with Old Testament prophecies against cities like Tyre and Nineveh (<a href="/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19-21</a>, <a href="/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>). The lamentation reflects the deep impact of Babylon's fall on those who benefited from her, highlighting the transient nature of worldly power and wealth.<p><b>&#8220;What city was ever like this great city?&#8221; they will exclaim.</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the unparalleled nature of Babylon's greatness and subsequent fall. It echoes the lament over Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32</a>, where the city's unmatched splendor and influence are mourned. The phrase underscores the theme of hubris and the inevitable downfall of those who exalt themselves against God. In a broader biblical context, it serves as a warning against idolatry and the pursuit of earthly glory, contrasting with the eternal kingdom of God. The exclamation also points to the ultimate futility of human pride and the certainty of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_city.htm">The Great City</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Babylon, symbolizing a powerful, corrupt system or empire that opposes God.
