The scroll represents God's ultimate plan for redemption and judgment, sealed with seven seals, indicating its completeness and divine origin. This act signifies the transition of power and the unfolding of end-time events.<p><b>the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb</b><br>The four living creatures are often understood as angelic beings or cherubim, representing all of creation, while the twenty-four elders symbolize the redeemed people of God, possibly representing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. Their act of falling down before the Lamb is an expression of worship and acknowledgment of His divine authority and worthiness. This scene reflects the heavenly worship and the recognition of Christ's central role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>Each one had a harp</b><br>The harp is a traditional instrument of worship in biblical times, often associated with praise and prophecy. In the context of Revelation, it symbolizes the worship and adoration offered to God and the Lamb. The use of harps in this heavenly scene underscores the joy and reverence of the worshippers, aligning with the Old Testament tradition of using music in temple worship.<p><b>and they were holding golden bowls full of incense</b><br>Golden bowls signify the precious and sacred nature of their contents. Incense in the Bible is often associated with prayer and worship, as seen in the tabernacle and temple practices where incense was burned as a pleasing aroma to God. The use of incense here symbolizes the prayers of the faithful reaching God, indicating that the prayers of believers are valued and cherished in the heavenly realm.<p><b>which are the prayers of the saints</b><br>This phrase explicitly identifies the incense as the prayers of the saints, emphasizing the importance and power of prayer in the spiritual realm. The saints refer to all believers who are set apart for God. This imagery connects to the Old Testament practice where incense represented the prayers of the people rising to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>.

The vials (which seem to be censers, as they hold the incense) and the harps, it is perhaps more natural to suppose, were in the hands of the four-and-twenty elders, and not of the living creatures. Here, then, we have the praises (represented by the harps), and the prayers (represented by the censers) of the world-wide and age-long Church of Christ. The comparison of prayer with incense is in strict accordance with Old Testament language. "Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense" (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>). The incense held a conspicuous place in the ritual of the Temple. The greatest care was to be taken in the composition of the incense, and the same compound was not to be used anywhere but in the sanctuary. These precautions suggest its typical character. The true odours are the heart-prayers of God's children. "Of these three sweet ingredient perfumes," says Archbishop Leighton, alluding to the composition of the Temple-incense, "namely, petition, confession, thanksgiving, is the incense of prayer, and by the divine fire of love it ascends unto God, the heart and all with it; and when the hearts of the saints unite in joint prayer, the pillar of sweet smoke goes up the greater and the fuller." Every prayer which broke out in sob from an agonising heart, every sigh of the solitary and struggling Christian, every groan of those groping God- ward, mingles here with the songs of the happy and triumphant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - And when he had taken the book. "Had taken" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) is here aorist, not perfect, as in ver. 7. The text should probably read, <span class="accented">when he took the book</span>; that is to say, the adoration offered coincides in point of time with the act of taking the book. <span class="cmt_word">The four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb.</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">four beasts as</span> representing animated creation; the <span class="accented">four and twenty elders as</span> representative of the Church (see on Revelation 4:4, 6). <span class="cmt_word">Having every one of them harps.</span> (On the difficulty of <span class="accented">how</span> each one could hold harps and bowls, see on ver. 6.) It is possible that the phrase refers only to the elders; for these seem more suitably employed in offering <span class="accented">the prayers of the saints</span> than the representatives of all creation. If, however, as Wordsworth considers, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders together symbolize the Church, the phrase would apply to both. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16, 23</a> (the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of this passage) was played with the hand, and the instrument indicated was probably more of the nature of a guitar than the modern harp. <span class="cmt_word">And golden vials full of odours</span>. The Revised Version "bowls" is better than "vials." The idea is, no doubt, taken from the shallow bowls which were placed upon the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>), and in which incense was burned. The <span class="accented">odours</span> are the <span class="accented">incense. In</span> the same chapter of Exodus directions are given concerning the preparation and use of the incense, which was always a symbol of prayer, and always offered to God alone (cf. <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;" also <a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are the prayers of saints.</span> <span class="accented">The saints</span>; that is, the members of the Church of God. Some authorities consider "vials" the antecedent of" which;" but it seems best to refer "which" to "odours," though the sense is not materially different, since the former includes the latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
