In biblical context, cowardice is often associated with a failure to stand firm in one's faith. Jesus warned against denying Him before others (<a href="/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>), and the early church faced severe persecution, making courage a vital virtue.<p><b>and unbelieving</b><br>Unbelief is a central theme throughout Scripture, often linked to a rejection of God's truth and promises. <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> warns against having an unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. This phrase underscores the importance of faith as a foundational element of the Christian life.<p><b>and abominable</b><br>The term "abominable" refers to those who engage in detestable practices, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. In the Old Testament, certain practices were considered abominations, such as idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>) and sexual immorality (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>).<p><b>and murderers</b><br>Murder is explicitly condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). Jesus expanded on this in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, teaching that even harboring anger against others is akin to murder. This phrase highlights the seriousness of taking a life and the broader implications of hatred.<p><b>and sexually immoral</b><br>Sexual immorality encompasses a range of behaviors outside the biblical standard of sexual relations within marriage between a man and a woman. The New Testament frequently warns against such practices (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>), emphasizing purity and holiness.<p><b>and sorcerers</b><br>Sorcery, or witchcraft, involves the use of magic or supernatural powers apart from God. It is condemned in both the Old and New Testaments (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) as it often involves reliance on demonic forces and a rejection of God's sovereignty.<p><b>and idolaters</b><br>Idolatry is the worship of false gods or the elevation of anything above God. It is a recurring issue throughout the Bible, with the first two commandments addressing it directly (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Idolatry can also be metaphorical, referring to anything that takes precedence over God in one's life.<p><b>and all liars</b><br>Lying is condemned throughout Scripture as contrary to God's nature, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> lists a lying tongue among the things God hates. This phrase emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and integrity.<p><b>their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur</b><br>This imagery is used to describe the final judgment and eternal separation from God. The lake of fire is mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14-15</a> as the destination for death, Hades, and those not found in the Book of Life. It symbolizes ultimate punishment and the culmination of God's justice.<p><b>This is the second death.&#8221;</b><br>The "second death" refers to eternal separation from God, distinct from physical death. <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a> contrasts the second death with the first resurrection, highlighting the eternal consequences of one's spiritual state. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the eternal stakes involved in one's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cowardly.htm">Cowardly</a></b><br>Those who lack courage in faith, possibly due to fear of persecution or societal pressure.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelieving.htm">Unbelieving</a></b><br>Individuals who reject faith in God and the truth of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominable.htm">Abominable</a></b><br>Those who engage in detestable acts, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/murderers.htm">Murderers</a></b><br>People who unlawfully take the life of another, violating the commandment against killing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sexually_immoral.htm">Sexually Immoral</a></b><br>Those who engage in sexual practices outside the boundaries set by Scripture.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/s/sorcerers.htm">Sorcerers</a></b><br>Individuals who practice witchcraft or engage in occult activities, seeking power apart from God.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolaters.htm">Idolaters</a></b><br>Those who worship false gods or place anything above God in their lives.<br><br>8. <b><a href="/topical/l/liars.htm">Liars</a></b><br>People who deceive others, violating the commandment to bear false witness.<br><br>9. <b><a href="/topical/l/lake_of_fire.htm">Lake of Fire</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of eternal separation from God, often associated with final judgment.<br><br>10. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_death.htm">Second Death</a></b><br>The eternal state of separation from God, following physical death, for those not found in the Book of Life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br><a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a> highlights the gravity of sin and its eternal consequences.
