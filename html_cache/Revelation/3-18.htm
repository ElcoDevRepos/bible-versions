The "gold refined by fire" symbolizes faith and character tested and purified through trials (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). In biblical times, gold refining was a process of removing impurities, representing the purification of believers' faith. This counsel is directed to the church in Laodicea, known for its wealth and banking industry, yet spiritually impoverished. The call is to seek spiritual riches that endure, contrasting with their material wealth.<p><b>so that you may become rich</b><br>True richness is defined not by material wealth but by spiritual abundance. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where treasures in heaven are prioritized over earthly wealth. The Laodiceans are reminded that spiritual richness comes from a relationship with Christ, characterized by faith, hope, and love (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>).<p><b>white garments so that you may be clothed</b><br>White garments symbolize purity, righteousness, and victory (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 14</a>). In the context of Laodicea, known for its black wool, the contrast with white garments highlights the need for spiritual purity and righteousness. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of being clothed in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>), signifying a transformation from sin to holiness through Christ.<p><b>and your shameful nakedness not exposed</b><br>Nakedness in scripture often represents sin and shame (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>). The Laodiceans' spiritual state is likened to nakedness, indicating their vulnerability and need for Christ's covering. This phrase underscores the necessity of Christ's righteousness to cover human sinfulness, preventing spiritual exposure and shame.<p><b>and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see</b><br>Laodicea was famous for its medical school and eye salve, making this metaphor particularly poignant. The spiritual blindness of the Laodiceans is addressed with the need for divine insight and understanding. This aligns with biblical themes of spiritual enlightenment (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>) and the ability to discern truth through the Holy Spirit.

It is doubtful whether ver. 17 should be connected with ver. 18 or with ver. 16 - whether the self-satisfied condition of the Church is given as the reason why "I will spue thee out of my mouth," or as the reason why "I counsel thee to buy of me." The Revised Version follows the Authorized Version in connecting yore. 17 and 18; and this view is supported by Alford, Bengel, Dusterdieck, Ebrard. But Trench prefers the other view. The Authorized Version seems correct, for the reason why "I will spue thee" is given in ver. 16, and another separate reason would probably (though not certainly) not be added. Though St. Paul (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>) had pointed out to the Laodiceans (see on the epistle generally, vers. 14-22; and el. <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>) where "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," they had not heeded the lesson, and now Christ once more counsels them to obtain true riches from the proper source. They are to buy <span class="accented">from me</span>; the emphasis being laid on <span class="accented">me</span>, in contradistinction to their trust in themselves. They are <span class="accented">poor</span> (ver. 17), and must therefore obtain <span class="accented">gold refined by the fire -</span> gold superior to that on the possession of which they so prided themselves, that they may indeed <span class="accented">be rich. To buy</span> this gold by giving something of equal value in exchange, they were truly unable. Yet it was to be bought, and would entail the sacrifice of something which, though perhaps dear to them, would be nothing in comparison with the return they would obtain. Note the Revised Version rendering <span class="accented">may become rich</span>, repeating and enforcing the fact of their present destitution. <span class="cmt_word">And white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed</span>. Laodicea is said to have been famous for the raven blackness of the wool which was prepared and dyed there. This, perhaps, explains the point of the reproof contained in these words. "Notwithstanding thy trust in the excellence of the apparel for which thou aft famous, thou art yet naked (ver. 17), and needest clothing; that clothing can be obtained only from me, and is far superior to that of which thou boastest, since it is <span class="accented">white</span>, the emblem of all that is purest and best; not black, like your own, which is a type of darkness, the darkness of ignorance and sin. Mine is indeed the garment of righteousness, the marriage garment with which thou mayest enter the presence of thy King." <span class="cmt_word">And that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear</span>. The nakedness will certainly be made apparent at some time. If it be persistently overlooked or ignored now, it will be made more glaring in the future, when God turns upon it the brightness of his presence. In the Revised Version "appear" is even more emphatically rendered "be made manifest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). "Stripping," in the Bible, is commonly used to denote putting to shame: Hanun cut off the garments of David's servants (<a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>); the King of Assyria was to lead away the Egyptians naked and barefoot (<a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>; see also <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>); while supplying with clothes, or an additional quantity of clothes, was intended to show honour: thus Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in vestures of fine linen (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>); Joseph gave Benjamin five changes of raiment (<a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; see also <a href="/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>). And anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. This is, of course, a reference in the "blindness" of ver. 17, of which the Laodiceans were ignorant. "Eyesalve" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span>, perhaps so called because made up in the shape of a cake of bread - <span class="accented">collyra.</span> We cannot but think, in connexion with this passage, of the miracle of the healing of the blind man by the anointing of his eyes by our Lord - a miracle witnessed and related by St. John (<a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.). The subsequent incidents and discourse, too, forcibly illustrate the state of the Laodiceans, so much like that of the Pharisees, to whom were addressed the words, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth" (see on ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I counsel</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(symbouleu&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4823.htm">Strong's 4823: </a> </span><span class="str2">From sun and bouleuo; to give advice jointly, i.e. Recommend, deliberate or determine.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(soi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
