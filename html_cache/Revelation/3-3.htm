The early church received the gospel message through oral tradition and letters, which were considered authoritative. This call to remembrance is similar to Paul's exhortations in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-2</a>, where he reminds believers of the gospel he preached. The emphasis on "received and heard" underscores the importance of both the transmission and reception of divine truth.<p><b>Keep it and repent.</b><br>The instruction to "keep it" suggests a continuous, active guarding of the faith, akin to the vigilance required of a watchman. Repentance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, signifying a turning away from sin and a return to God. This call to repentance is consistent with the messages to other churches in Revelation, such as Ephesus (<a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>), where believers are urged to return to their first love. The dual command to keep and repent highlights the necessity of both fidelity to the truth and a lifestyle of ongoing transformation.<p><b>If you do not wake up,</b><br>The warning to "wake up" implies spiritual lethargy or complacency. In the context of the church in Sardis, this could reflect a community that has become comfortable and self-satisfied, neglecting the vigilance required of them. The metaphor of waking up is used throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>, where Paul urges believers to awaken from their slumber because salvation is nearer than when they first believed. This call to alertness is a reminder of the imminent return of Christ and the need for readiness.<p><b>I will come like a thief,</b><br>The imagery of a thief is used to describe the unexpected and sudden nature of Christ's return. This metaphor is also found in <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, where the day of the Lord is likened to a thief in the night. The unpredictability of a thief's arrival serves as a warning to remain vigilant and prepared. In the historical context, Sardis was a city that had been captured twice due to a lack of watchfulness, making this warning particularly poignant for its inhabitants.<p><b>and you will not know the hour when I will come upon you.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the uncertainty of the timing of Christ's return, reinforcing the need for constant readiness. The unpredictability of the hour is a common theme in eschatological teachings, as seen in <a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>, where Jesus states that no one knows the day or hour of His return. This uncertainty serves as a motivation for believers to live in a state of perpetual preparedness, maintaining their faith and commitment to Christ in anticipation of His coming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_sardis.htm">The Church in Sardis</a></b><br>One of the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation.

The further expectation is to hold fast, or keep--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as an abiding habit. It has been noticed that this counsel is identical with that given to Timothy to "keep the good thing which had been committed to his charge" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2Timothy 1:14</a>; comp. also <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2Timothy 2:2</a>). "Repent" is the closing word; combined with the exhortation to hold fast, it reminds us that formal tenacity of truth and a fruitless inactive regret are alike useless. There must be the sorrow for the past, and a sorrow which shows itself in action--a repentance whereby sin is forsaken. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm" title="Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent.">Revelation 2:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-21.htm" title="And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.">Revelation 2:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If therefore thou shalt not watch.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If thou shalt not watch</span> (or, <span class= "ital">have been awake</span>)<span class= "ital">, I will come</span> (omit "on thee") <span class= "ital">as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</span> The warning is an echo from the Gospels (<a href="/context/matthew/24-42.htm" title="Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come.">Matthew 24:42-43</a>; <a href="/context/luke/12-39.htm" title="And this know, that if the manager of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.">Luke 12:39-40</a>). The coming of Christ to judge His Church would be in an hour unlooked for. What kind of hour He would so come was' unknown; the sound of His approaching footsteps unheard. Shod with wool, according to the ancient proverb, stealthily as a thief, the Judge would be at the door. Yet they could not plead that they had been in darkness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear</span> (comp. <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>). Like the Ephesians, the Sardians are reminded of the better condition from which they have receded. They are of those "who, when they have heard the Word, straightway receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while" (<a href="/mark/4-16.htm">Mark 4:16, 17</a>). The "how," as is shown by the verbs "receive" and "hear," refers to the readiness with which they accepted the gospel, rather than to the power with which it was preached to them. The tenses are instructive: the aorist applies to the hearing at some definite period in their history; the perfect implies the permanent result of the act of reception. Keep and repent. Keep what thou didst hear. "Keep" is better than "hold fast," to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 8, 10</a>, etc.), and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 13, 14, 15, 25</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). Here again the tenses should be noted: the present imperative indicates that they are to <span class="accented">continue</span> to keep; the aorist, that they are to repent <span class="accented">once for all.</span> We have a similar combination of tenses in" Take these things hence at once; continue to refrain from making my Father's house a house of merchandise" (<a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>; comp. <a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8, 11</a>; <a href="/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-34.htm">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>). "Remember" here and in <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a> is with equal fitness the present imperative: "continue to remember." I will come as a thief. The "on thee" after "come," though well supported, is probably not genuine. Wherever this figure is used in the New Testament of the coming of Christ, the word used is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "a thief," and not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, a "robber" or "bandit." This shows, what is also plain from the context, that secrecy, not violence, is the point of the similitude (comp. <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>).
