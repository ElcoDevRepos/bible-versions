The imagery of a thief is used elsewhere in the New Testament (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>) to describe the unforeseen timing of the Day of the Lord. It underscores the need for constant vigilance and readiness among believers. In the cultural context of the first century, a thief would strike when least expected, often at night, which parallels the call for spiritual alertness.<p><b>Blessed is the one who remains awake and clothed,</b><br>The blessing here is pronounced on those who are spiritually vigilant and prepared. Remaining "awake" suggests a state of spiritual alertness and readiness, akin to the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), where preparedness is key. Being "clothed" symbolizes righteousness and the covering of Christ's salvation (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>). In ancient times, clothing was also a sign of dignity and status, and being properly dressed was essential for honor.<p><b>so that he will not go naked and let his shame be exposed.</b><br>Nakedness in biblical terms often represents vulnerability, shame, and sin (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). The warning against being found naked is a call to maintain one's spiritual integrity and righteousness. In the historical context, being caught without proper attire, especially during a significant event, would be a source of great embarrassment and dishonor. This phrase serves as a metaphor for the spiritual disgrace that comes from being unprepared for Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who warns of His unexpected return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thief.htm">The Thief</a></b><br>A metaphor for the suddenness and unexpected nature of Christ's return.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessed.htm">The Blessed</a></b><br>Those who remain vigilant and prepared for Christ's coming.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nakedness.htm">Nakedness</a></b><br>Symbolizes spiritual unpreparedness and shame.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/armageddon.htm">Armageddon</a></b><br>The context of this verse is within the broader account of the final battle between good and evil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_faith.htm">Vigilance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to remain spiritually alert and prepared for Christ's return, living in a state of readiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_clothing.htm">Spiritual Clothing</a></b><br>Just as physical clothing covers our bodies, spiritual clothing&#8212;righteousness and faith&#8212;covers our spiritual nakedness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_preparedness.htm">The Blessing of Preparedness</a></b><br>There is a blessing promised to those who are prepared and vigilant, highlighting the importance of living a life of faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_spiritual_shame.htm">Avoiding Spiritual Shame</a></b><br>Spiritual nakedness represents a lack of preparedness and can lead to shame; believers must strive to live in a way that honors God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">The Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>The unexpected nature of Christ's return should motivate believers to share the Gospel urgently and live out their faith boldly.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_16_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 16:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_spiritually_awake.htm">How can we stay spiritually "awake" as Revelation 16:15 advises believers to be?

If therefore you shall not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come on you.">Revelation 3:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a>. Comp. <a href="/context/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35-40</a>). It reminds us not only that our Lord may come unexpectedly, but that He may even come and we be unaware. There is one day when He will come, and every eye will behold Him; but He comes in various ways and forms to bless and to test man. Blessed are they who are ready, watching. But vigilance is not enough: the garments must be kept. The powers of evil are abroad. Sloth and pleasure may counsel ease, and tempt the watcher to lay aside his garments and take rest and sleep. The earnest watcher desires, like St. Paul, to be found in Christ, clad in the true righteousness of faith (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I come as a thief.</span> The very words addressed to the Church at Sardis (<a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>), and similar to those connected by our blessed Lord with the great day (see ver. 14). The mention of that day, and perhaps the knowledge that the battle is a daily one (see on ver. 14), naturally leads to the solemn warning given here. It is worth notice how St. John adopts this idea; and this of itself should suffice to demonstrate the incorrectness of endeavoring to compute the times and seasons, as has been done by so many Apocalyptic writers (cf. also <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</span> The same figure again as in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>. Isaac Williams correctly points out that these words seem to indicate that the battle of ver. 14 is a daily one, in which Christians are themselves engaged (see on ver. 14). The garment is the garment of righteousness, the fervent love of God (see on Revelation 3:17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Behold,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(Idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
