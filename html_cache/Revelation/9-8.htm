The imagery of "hair like that of women" suggests a sense of allure or seduction, possibly indicating deception or the ability to entice. In ancient times, long hair was often associated with femininity and beauty, which could symbolize the deceptive nature of these creatures. This imagery might also reflect the cultural norms of the time, where women's hair was considered a significant aspect of their appearance. The seductive nature of these locusts could be a metaphor for false teachings or ideologies that appear attractive but are ultimately destructive.<p><b>and teeth like those of lions</b><br>The phrase "teeth like those of lions" conveys strength, ferocity, and the ability to cause harm. Lions are often used in the Bible as symbols of power and danger (e.g., <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where the devil is compared to a roaring lion). This imagery suggests that while the locusts may appear alluring, they are also fierce and capable of inflicting great pain. The combination of beauty and brutality in this description highlights the dual nature of the threat they pose. This duality can be seen as a warning against being deceived by appearances, emphasizing the need for discernment. The reference to lions also connects to prophetic imagery found in the Old Testament, such as in the book of Joel, where locusts are described as a powerful army (<a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locusts.htm">The Locusts</a></b><br>These are not ordinary locusts but symbolic creatures described in the vision of the Apostle John.

In Scripture, a woman&#8217;s long hair is portrayed as her glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>) and, at times, as an emblem of strength or allure (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; By giving these demonic creatures such hair, the Lord shows they can appear enticing while harboring deadly intent. Their look invites trust, yet their nature is bent on torment.<p>&#8226; This contrast underscores how evil often disguises itself. Paul writes that &#8220;Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>). The locusts&#8217; &#8220;woman-like hair&#8221; reflects that same deceptive veneer.<p>&#8226; Taking the text at face value, John truly saw beings with long hair. Their appearance is not poetic exaggeration but a literal feature that warns readers: outward beauty can mask spiritual danger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Teeth like those of lions</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;and teeth like those of lions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Lion&#8217;s teeth stand for raw power and the capacity to tear and destroy. <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> speaks of a locust invasion whose &#8220;teeth are those of a lion,&#8221; anticipating this scene.<p>&#8226; Lions are fearless predators (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>), symbols of overpowering strength (<a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>) and, in prophetic imagery, of kingdoms that devour (<a href="/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>). These demonic locusts inherit that predatory ferocity.<p>&#8226; Combining irresistible force with seductive appearance, they embody Satan&#8217;s twofold strategy: lure and then savage. Jesus warned of wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>); here we see locusts with lion&#8217;s teeth.<p>&#8226; The literal detail&#8212;actual lion-like teeth&#8212;assures us these creatures are fully capable of inflicting the agonizing five-month torment described in <a href="/revelation/9-5.htm">Revelation 9:5-6</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s vision of locusts &#8220;with hair like that of women, and teeth like those of lions&#8221; shows evil&#8217;s dual nature: enticing on the surface, vicious at the core. Their woman-like hair hints at seduction; their lion-like teeth guarantee brutal harm. Both features are literal, vivid elements of the coming judgment, reminding believers to discern beyond appearances and trust the Lord&#8217;s warnings in His infallible Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8)<span class= "bld">And they had hair . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions, and they had breastplates as iron breastplates; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of</span> (having, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> drawn by) <span class= "ital">many horses, running to war.</span> The hair: It is said that some locusts are hairy, and the passage in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>) has been quoted as evidence (the rough caterpillars here spoken of being said to be "locusts bristling with hair"), but the application of the passage is uncertain: the rough caterpillar may be the locust in the third stage, when the wings are still enveloped in rough horny cases which stick upon their backs. Others think the idea of the woman-like hair has its basis in the antlers of the locust. The teeth like those of the lion is a description the origin of which is found in the prophet Joel, in his prediction of the locust plague: "a nation cometh upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek-teeth (or, <span class= "ital">grinding-teeth)</span> of a great lion." The terrible destructiveness of the locusts, and their strong, ceaseless, and resistless voracity, were thus described. Their breastplates are taken as descriptive of their thoraxes, which in the vision seemed strong as iron. The comparison of the sound of the wings to the thunderous sound of chariots and horses rushing into battle is repeated from Joel 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had hair as the hair of women.</span> This (like the succeeding clause) seems merely the enumeration of an additional feature, in which these creatures resembled locusts, and which helped to establish their claim to the name. The antennae of the insect are probably referred to. Wordsworth sees here an allusion to the flowing hair of Mohammed and the Saracens. And their teeth were as the teeth of lions. The powerful nature of the teeth of the locust is a remarkable feature of the insect; and it is here more fully referred to in order to enhance the general terror of their aspect (cf. <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They had</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eichon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
