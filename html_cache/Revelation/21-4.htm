It echoes <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, where God promises to swallow up death forever and wipe away tears from all faces. The imagery of God personally wiping away tears suggests a close, personal relationship between God and His people, emphasizing His role as a loving Father. In the ancient Near Eastern context, tears were often associated with mourning and suffering, and the act of wiping them away symbolizes the end of sorrow and the beginning of eternal joy.<p><b>and there will be no more death</b><br>The abolition of death fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, where death is described as the last enemy to be destroyed. In the biblical narrative, death entered the world through sin (Genesis 3), and its eradication signifies the complete restoration of creation. This promise of no more death is central to the Christian hope of eternal life, where believers will experience unending fellowship with God.<p><b>or mourning or crying or pain,</b><br>These elements are representative of the human experience of suffering and loss. Mourning, crying, and pain are consequences of the fallen world and human sinfulness. The promise that these will cease is a direct result of the new creation, where the effects of sin are entirely removed. This aligns with the prophetic vision in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, where God creates new heavens and a new earth, and the former troubles are forgotten.<p><b>for the former things have passed away.&#8221;</b><br>The "former things" refer to the current world order, characterized by sin, suffering, and death. This phrase indicates a complete transformation and renewal of creation, as described in <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>, where believers look forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness. The passing away of the former things signifies the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where the old order is replaced by a new, perfect existence in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who will wipe away every tear, signifying His intimate care and compassion for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_jerusalem.htm">New Jerusalem</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the New Jerusalem, the holy city where God dwells with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who received this vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_redeemed.htm">The Redeemed</a></b><br>Those who have been saved by faith in Jesus Christ and are experiencing the fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_former_things.htm">The Former Things</a></b><br>Refers to the current world order, characterized by sin, suffering, and death, which will pass away.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion_and_comfort.htm">God's Compassion and Comfort</a></b><br>God is intimately involved in the lives of His people, offering comfort and healing from all forms of suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_end_of_suffering.htm">The End of Suffering</a></b><br>The promise of no more death, mourning, crying, or pain is a future hope that believers can hold onto amidst present trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_creation.htm">The New Creation</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live in the reality of the new creation, where the old order of sin and death is replaced by eternal life and joy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>This verse assures believers of the certainty of God's promises, encouraging them to remain steadfast in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Christians are called to focus on the eternal perspective, understanding that current sufferings are temporary and will be replaced by eternal joy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_21_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 21:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Rev_21_4_give_hope_in_grief.htm">How does Revelation 21:4 offer hope for those experiencing grief today?
