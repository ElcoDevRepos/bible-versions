The "sea of glass" symbolizes purity, holiness, and the transcendence of God's presence. The addition of "mixed with fire" suggests judgment and purification, reflecting God's righteous wrath against sin. Fire often represents God's holiness and judgment throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, which describes God as a consuming fire.<p><b>beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name</b><br>This phrase refers to the faithful believers who have overcome the trials and temptations associated with the beast, as described in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>.

Music in Scripture expresses joy and thanksgiving (<a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>; 144:9). These are not merely symbolic instruments; they are tangible gifts from the Father, enabling the redeemed to join the eternal anthem that celebrates His justice and mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a> pictures a tangible, heavenly scene: God&#8217;s glass-like sea, now glowing with judgment fire, becomes the platform where tribulation martyrs&#8212;true overcomers&#8212;stand secure and celebrate. Their victory over the beast, their God-given harps, and their place before the throne assure every believer that faithfulness will be rewarded and that God&#8217;s holiness both judges evil and welcomes His own into joyous worship forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire.</span>--The wild beast rose out of the sea (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>); the evil-hearted woman sits upon many waters (<a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>); they draw strength from the wild, and ungoverned, and short-sighted impulses of human passion; in opposition to this near the throne of God is the calm and translucent sea of God's counsels of righteousness and love, now clear as crystal, now ruddy with the fire of righteous indignation, the expression of His eternal will against sin. Such is the appearance of this glass-like sea now that the angels of the plagues are going forth.<p>But the seer saw more than this fire-flushed sea. He saw also those that are victorious over the wild beast. These he describes (such is the literal translation) as <span class= "ital">those who conquer out of the wild beast, </span>&c.; they come off conquerors out of the struggle, and they escape from the temptation to worship his image and wear the badge of his service: they "escape victorious from" his image and from his mark. When he sees these, they are <span class= "ital">standing upon </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on the shore of) <span class= "ital">the sea of glass, holding harps of God.</span> We have had the harps mentioned previously (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a>); it is appropriate. The life which has been a discord to the world rises into true music before God; those who will make their life a melody must take it first as a conflict. The harps they hold are called harps of God, not merely because they are dedicated to Him. but because they are truly God's. All the most glorious and noble things in nature were named God's: the lofty trees were "trees of God "; the high-piled mountains were "mountains of God "; so also the harps which strike forth the richest music are "harps of God." Nor is this a mere phrase to be considered as equivalent to very great or very glorious; great and glorious the trees, hills, and harps are, but only a prosaic or a profane mind can be satisfied with such a naked equivalent. The godly saw the hand of God in these things; and St. John knows that the noblest melody in the ears of God is the noble life of faith, suffering, and love. The power of such a life is in God, not in itself (<a href="/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), and the music of such a life is music which God makes (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7-10</a>), drawing the sweetest tones from the strings which are smitten with pain and sorrow; and as its life's music is God-taught, so does its song of triumph sound from a harp not its own, but God's. If our power to sing in trial here a song worthy of God is only found in God, so will the songs of heaven be sweet only in Him, for those who dwell there shall be all taught of Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire.</span> "And I saw" indicates a new phase of the vision (cf. <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6, 14</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">sea</span> was like <span class="accented">glass</span>, either because of its pure transparent appearance, or on account of its consistency; the saints being subsequently described as standing on it. (For a full discussion of the meaning, see on Revelation 4:6.) The sea, the elders, and the triumphal hymns of praise are all characteristic of the vision in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. <span class="accented">Mingled with fire.</span> In <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. it was described as "like unto crystal." The fire is an emblem of purity; the same idea is also conveyed by the "crystal." Fire is also a symbol of judgment, which is the theme of the song of the saints (ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">And them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God;</span> <span class="accented">and them that come victorious from the beast and from his image, and from the number</span>, etc. Omit "and over his mark," according to all the best authorities. <span class="accented">Standing by</span> (or, <span class="accented">on</span>)<span class="accented">, having harps.</span> (On "the beast" and "his image," etc., see on Revelation 13.)

The "harps" are characteristic of the heavenly melodies (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>).
