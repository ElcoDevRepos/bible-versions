The curse brought sin, death, and separation from God into the world. In <a href="/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>, the absence of the curse indicates the restoration of creation to its original state of perfection and harmony with God. This echoes the prophetic visions of a new heaven and a new earth found in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>, where righteousness dwells and the effects of sin are eradicated.<p><b>The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city,</b><br>The presence of the throne signifies God's sovereign rule and authority. The mention of both God and the Lamb highlights the unity and co-reign of the Father and Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. This imagery connects to the vision in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4 and 5</a>, where the throne is central to the heavenly scene, emphasizing God's majesty and the Lamb's worthiness. The city refers to the New Jerusalem, described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people, fulfilling the promise of Emmanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and His servants will worship Him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal purpose and joy of God's people: to worship Him. Worship in this context is not limited to singing or rituals but encompasses a life of service, devotion, and adoration. The term "servants" reflects the redeemed's identity and role, reminiscent of the faithful servants in Jesus' parables (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). This worship is a fulfillment of the call to worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>) and is a direct contrast to the idolatry and false worship condemned throughout Revelation.

All accursed things are removed, and with them passes the curse. The blessing of God's presence, and the blessing of God's rule take the place of the ascendancy of evil over the groaning creation (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>). "The throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it." The song of the Psalmist receives new force: "the Lord reigneth: let the earth rejoice; let the multitudes of the isles be glad thereof;" the accursed things, even all things that offend, are gathered out of the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/13-41.htm" title="The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;">Matthew 13:41</a>).<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">And his servants shall serve him . . .</span>--We turn from the city to the inhabitants. They are described as serving Him, seeing Him, and resembling Him. They shall serve Him: they shall offer Him the service of the priesthood--the word employed is that used of temple service. The word translated "servants" is the word which the Apostles used when they spoke of <span class= "ital">themselves</span> as <span class= "ital">slaves</span> of Jesus Christ, owned as well as employed by Him (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>). Their service here was discharged in the midst of discouragements and in difficulty; and they walked by faith, not by sight.

The <span class= "ital">name</span> stands for what God is in holiness and righteousness, purity and love. The name on the forehead indicates their resemblance to their Master.

His name is on their foreheads, for they behold His face: they wake up after His likeness, and they are satisfied (<a href="/psalms/17-15.htm" title="As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness.">Psalm 17:15</a>). There is a divine paradox in the double truth: those who are like God see Him, and those who see Him are like Him (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>). "There will come a time when the service of God shall be the beholding of Him; and though in these stormy seas, where we are now driven up and down, His Spirit is dimly seen on the face of the waters, and we are left to cast anchors out of the stern and wish for the day, that day will come, when, with the evangelist on the crystal and stable sea, all the creatures of God shall be full of eyes within, and there shall be no more curse, but His servants shall serve Him, and shall see His face" (Ruskin). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be no more curse;</span> <span class="accented">and there shall be no accursed thing any more.</span> Nothing accursed exists in that city, because there is no sin there. The narrative here passes into the future tense (cf. <a href="/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him;</span> <span class="accented">and the throne</span>, etc. This is the consequence of there being no accursed thing (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-12.htm">Joshua 7:12, 13</a>, "Neither will I be with you any more .... There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel"). God dwells in the city because all is holy. The throne of God and of the Lamb is one - God and the Lamb are one. Again, <span class="accented">his servants</span>, the servants of God and the Lamb (cf. <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). They "serve him," as described in <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1-7</a> and elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
