The context is a message to the church in Thyatira, where a woman symbolically referred to as "Jezebel" is leading believers into immorality and idolatry. The reference to "time" indicates God's longsuffering nature, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish. The call to repentance is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing God's desire for sinners to turn from their ways, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>.

In <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-32</a>, Paul describes a similar refusal to acknowledge God, leading to a depraved mind. The cultural context of Thyatira, a city known for its trade guilds, often involved participation in pagan rituals, which could pressure believers to compromise their faith.
