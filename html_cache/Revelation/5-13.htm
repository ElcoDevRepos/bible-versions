The mention of "every creature" signifies the totality of creation, reflecting the biblical theme of all creation praising God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/148.htm">Psalm 148</a>. The inclusion of "heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea" suggests a comprehensive view of the cosmos, encompassing all realms of existence. This echoes <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee bows and every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord. The phrase "under the earth" may refer to the realm of the dead or spiritual beings, indicating that even those not visible to the living are part of this worship. The sea, often seen as a symbol of chaos in ancient Near Eastern thought, is also included, showing God's dominion over all chaos and disorder.<p><b>&#8220;To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb</b><br>This part of the verse identifies the recipients of worship: God the Father ("Him who sits on the throne") and Jesus Christ ("the Lamb"). The throne is a symbol of divine authority and kingship, frequently mentioned in Revelation as the center of God's rule (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>). The Lamb is a title for Jesus, highlighting His sacrificial role, as seen in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. The dual focus on both the Father and the Son underscores the unity and co-equality within the Godhead, a foundational Christian doctrine. The Lamb imagery connects to the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, symbolizing deliverance and redemption.<p><b>be praise and honor and glory and power</b><br>These four attributes are ascribed to both the Father and the Son, indicating their shared divine nature. "Praise" involves adoration and worship, "honor" denotes respect and reverence, "glory" refers to the divine majesty and splendor, and "power" signifies authority and might. This echoes the doxologies found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> and <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>, where similar attributes are ascribed to God. The repetition of these terms in Revelation highlights the eternal and unchanging nature of God's character.<p><b>forever and ever!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of God's reign and the perpetual worship He receives. The concept of eternity is a key theme in Revelation, contrasting the temporal nature of earthly powers with the everlasting kingdom of God. This eternal perspective is also seen in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the dominion of the Son of Man is described as everlasting. The phrase "forever and ever" assures believers of the ultimate victory and unending rule of God, providing hope and encouragement amidst persecution and trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/every_creature.htm">Every Creature</a></b><br>This phrase encompasses all of creation, indicating a universal acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. It includes beings in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the sea.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/him_who_sits_on_the_throne.htm">Him who sits on the throne</a></b><br>This refers to God the Father, the sovereign ruler of the universe, who is often depicted as seated on a throne in heavenly visions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>This is a title for Jesus Christ, symbolizing His sacrificial role in redemption. The Lamb is central to the worship and adoration described in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven,_earth,_under_the_earth,_and_the_sea.htm">Heaven, Earth, Under the Earth, and the Sea</a></b><br>These locations represent the entirety of creation, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the worship being described.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/praise,_honor,_glory,_and_power.htm">Praise, Honor, Glory, and Power</a></b><br>These are the attributes ascribed to God and the Lamb, highlighting their divine nature and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_worship.htm">Universal Worship</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes that all of creation is called to worship God and the Lamb.

The song of the redeemed, echoed by the hosts of angels, is now merged in the utterance of all. "Every creature which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and beneath the earth, and upon the sea, and all the things that are in them, heard I saying--<p>"To Him that sitteth upon the throne,<p>And to the Lamb,<p>(Be) the blessing, and the honour,<p>And the glory, and the might,<p>To the ages of the ages."<p>The song of praise rises from all quarters, and from all forms of creation. The whole universe, animate and inanimate, joins in this glad acclaim. To limit it to either rational or animate creation is to enfeeble the climax which this third chorus forms to the two preceding ones, and is to denude the passage of its fulness and of its poetry. The Hebrew mind delighted in representing every bird and every grass-blade as joining in God's praise. "Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars, beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl," as well as kings of the earth and all people, were called on to bless the name of the Lord. Christian poets have told us that "Earth with her thousand voices praises God."<p>"Nature, attend! join every living soul,<p>Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,<p>In adoration join'd; and, ardent, raise<p>One general song! To Him, ye vocal gales,<p>Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness breathes. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them;</span> <span class="accented">and every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them</span> (Revised Version). All animated creation now joins in the ascription of praise. Those <span class="accented">under the earth</span> are probably the <span class="accented">"spirits</span> in prison" of <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>, though Vitringa understands the expression to be used of the devils <span class="accented">"who</span> unwillingly obey Christ," and even declare his glory, as in <a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>, "I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God." <span class="accented">The sea</span> is meant literally; the apostle's object being to include all animated beings wheresoever existing. It has been remarked that St. John's exile at Patmos would render him familiar with the appearance of the sea, and account for its frequent use in the Apocalypse, both literally and symbolically. The things on <span class="accented">the sea</span> would signify, not merely ships with their inhabitants, but also those animals in the sea which are known to men by dwelling near the surface. "All things that are in them" serves to render emphatic the universality of the description, as in <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, <span class="accented">"The</span> Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." <span class="cmt_word">Heard I saying.</span> "Saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in 10, 13, P, Vulgate, Andr. <span class="accented">a, c</span>, Arethas, Primasius. But the neuter, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is read in <span class="accented">A, 1</span>, 12, Andr. p, bay. <span class="cmt_word">Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power;</span> <span class="accented">the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the dominion</span> (Revised Version). The Revisers have wisely rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the dominion," by a different word from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "power," of ver. 12, both of which in the Authorized Version are rendered "power." The article, too, serves to give greater emphasis, making the expression tantamount to "all blessing," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). Nothing is signified by the omission of three attributes. The number four is symbolical of the complete creation, and may be used on that account; but probably the omission is to avoid repetition, the four attributes given being typical of the seven just previously uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</span> That is, unto the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). Christ, as having part with the Father and the Holy Ghost in the Godhead, sits upon the throne, and is worthy with them to receive adoration. But in his special character as the Redeemer, he is also singled out to receive the praises of the redeemed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
