However, these locusts are unique in that they are not permitted to kill. This limitation suggests a controlled judgment, emphasizing God's sovereignty even in wrath. The restraint shown here aligns with God's character of mercy, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are described as new every morning.<p><b>but only to torment them for five months</b><br>The five-month period is significant as it corresponds to the typical lifespan of a locust, from May to September in the Middle Eastern climate. This time frame indicates a temporary judgment, not eternal, reflecting God's patience and desire for repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). The torment without death echoes the plagues in Egypt, where suffering was intended to lead to repentance and acknowledgment of God's power.<p><b>and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion</b><br>The comparison to a scorpion's sting highlights the intense pain and suffering inflicted by these locusts. In the ancient Near East, scorpions were feared for their painful and sometimes deadly sting. This imagery conveys the severity of the judgment. The use of simile here underscores the symbolic nature of the vision, pointing to a spiritual or psychological torment rather than a physical one. This torment can be seen as a precursor to the final judgment, urging repentance and faith in Christ, who offers deliverance from such suffering (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locusts.htm">The Locusts</a></b><br>These are not ordinary locusts but symbolic creatures released from the abyss, representing a form of divine judgment.

Demonic locusts cannot kill because God limits their power; their mission is torment, pressing unrepentant humanity toward decision. The five-month duration shows both precision and mercy, while the scorpion-like pain underscores the seriousness of resisting God. Even in judgment, His sovereignty, justice, and patient call to repentance shine through.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And to them . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And it was given to them that they should not kill them (i.e.,</span> those who had not the seal of God in their foreheads), <span class= "ital">but that they should be tortured five months.</span> The general period of a locust plague is about five months: "as the natural locusts commit their ravages only for five months, so the ravages of these symbolical ones will be only for a short period" (Stuart). Their power is to inflict torment, and not death. The next verse tells us that men would consider death preferable to this torment; but the relief of the grave is denied them.<p><span class= "bld">And their torment </span>. . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">and the torture of them (i.e.,</span> the torture inflicted by them) <span class= "ital">is as the torture of a scorpion when it has stricken a man.</span> The wound of a scorpion occasions intense suffering: we have in it the symbol of the malicious cruelty of the merciless. The emblem is used in Ezekiel: the rebellious and malicious opponents of the prophet being compared to scorpions (<a href="/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>). We may compare the similar imagery of the bee for the Assyrian power (<a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>), and the Psalmist's complaint that his enemies came about him like bees--a swarm, irritating him with wing and sting. The tenth verse tells us the way in which the injury was inflicted: there were stings in their tails.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given them</span> [i.e. the locusts] <span class="accented">that they</span> [the locusts] <span class="accented">should not kill them</span> [the unsealed], <span class="accented">but that they</span> [the unsealed] <span class="accented">should be tormented five months.</span> The devil and his agents have not unlimited power committed to them; they are restrained within limits by the will of God. The evils which follow in the train of heresy and infidelity are not as yet permitted to kill (cf. <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>), for this judgment extends only to the natural life of man. God reserves the final killing to himself at the great judgment day. This is shown in the limitation, "five months." This apparently meaningless period becomes explicable, when we remember that the usual duration of a locust plague is <span class="accented">five months</span>, viz. from April to September. The visitation is for the natural period of such occurrences; the torment is to extend to the natural period of man's sojourn on the earth. It does not extend into the next life; other and special means are adopted for man's punishment then, as set forth under the seventh trumpet.
