The term "another" indicates continuity with previous visions, particularly those involving signs in heaven, such as the woman and the dragon in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. The "great and marvelous sign" suggests something of significant importance and divine origin, emphasizing the awe-inspiring nature of what is to be revealed. In biblical context, signs in heaven often indicate divine intervention or the unfolding of God's plan, as seen in the Old Testament with the signs given to the prophets.<p><b>Seven angels with the seven final plagues:</b><br>The number seven is symbolic throughout the Bible, often representing completeness or perfection, as seen in the seven days of creation. The presence of seven angels signifies a divine mission, as angels are messengers of God. The "seven final plagues" echo the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, which were judgments against Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt. These plagues in Revelation are the culmination of God's judgment on a rebellious world, indicating a finality and completeness in God's plan for justice.<p><b>With which the wrath of God is completed:</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the plagues: to fulfill God's righteous judgment. The "wrath of God" is a theme throughout Scripture, representing God's holy and just response to sin and rebellion. In the New Testament, the wrath of God is often contrasted with His mercy and grace, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3-5</a>. The completion of God's wrath here signifies the end of His judgment upon the earth, paving the way for the establishment of His eternal kingdom. This completion aligns with prophetic themes in the Old Testament, such as in Daniel and Isaiah, where God's ultimate victory and justice are foretold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives and records the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The setting of the vision, representing the divine realm where God's will is revealed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_angels.htm">Seven Angels</a></b><br>Divine messengers tasked with delivering the final plagues, symbolizing completeness and divine order.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_final_plagues.htm">Seven Final Plagues</a></b><br>Catastrophic events that signify the culmination of God's judgment and wrath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wrath_of_god.htm">The Wrath of God</a></b><br>The righteous anger of God against sin, which will be fully expressed and completed through these plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_wrath.htm">Understanding God's Wrath</a></b><br>God's wrath is a response to sin and injustice.

They are plagues; the word carries us back to Egypt: on Egypt fell the ten plagues which showed forth God's righteous power, and exposed the hollow pretensions of the magicians and their gods; the wild beast-power and the false prophet-power of that day was crippled and exposed. In like manner upon the wild beast-power of later ages the plagues of God fall. They are plagues, because they are sent forth, not like the trumpets to warn men to repent, but upon those who have obstinately refused to return; they are not goads to the wavering, but they are strokes upon the wilful and hardened; they are directed against those who are deliberately hostile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another sign in heaven.</span> The last time we had this expression was in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, where the history of the war between Satan and the Church was begun.
