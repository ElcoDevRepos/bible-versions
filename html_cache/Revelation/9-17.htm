The imagery is not meant to be taken literally but to convey deeper spiritual truths. The vision is part of the series of judgments unleashed by the sounding of the sixth trumpet, emphasizing the severity and divine origin of these events.<p><b>The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur:</b><br>The breastplates symbolize protection and readiness for battle. The colors&#8212;fire, sapphire, and sulfur&#8212;are significant. Fire often represents judgment and purification in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Sapphire, a blue stone, can symbolize heaven or divine revelation (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>). Sulfur, or brimstone, is associated with divine wrath and destruction (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). Together, these colors suggest a divine and fearsome force executing judgment.<p><b>The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions:</b><br>Lions are symbols of strength, power, and ferocity (<a href="/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>). The lion-like heads of the horses indicate the terrifying and unstoppable nature of this judgment. This imagery may also connect to the lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), suggesting that the judgment is under Christ's authority.<p><b>and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur:</b><br>The elements of fire, smoke, and sulfur are reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-28</a>), symbolizing complete and utter devastation. This triad of destructive forces indicates the comprehensive nature of the judgment. Fire purifies and consumes, smoke obscures and suffocates, and sulfur is a symbol of divine wrath. This imagery underscores the seriousness of the consequences for those who oppose God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives and records the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation given to John, depicting symbolic imagery of future events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_riders.htm">The Riders</a></b><br>Symbolic figures in the vision, representing agents of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_horses.htm">The Horses</a></b><br>Symbolic creatures with lion-like heads, representing destructive forces.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire,_smoke,_and_sulfur.htm">Fire, Smoke, and Sulfur</a></b><br>Elements proceeding from the horses' mouths, symbolizing judgment and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_judgment.htm">Symbolism of Judgment</a></b><br>The vivid imagery in <a href="/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a> serves as a powerful reminder of God's righteous judgment.

Just as Ezekiel precisely described the cherubim (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-14</a>), John anchors the coming judgment in concrete details so believers know it will truly occur.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur</b><p>&#8226; Fire-red, deep blue, and yellow-green echo the very elements soon to emerge&#8212;fire, smoke, and sulfur.<p>&#8226; These colors convey fierceness and impending wrath, recalling the fiery theophany at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and the burning throne scene (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the white robes of the redeemed (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>) these breastplates mark the riders as agents of destruction.

After this fashion were they: the horses and horsemen were armed with breastplates of triple hue (corresponding to the three-fold destructive stream which goes forth from their mouth), the hues of flame, and dark purple (jacinth), and brimstone. The jacinth colour seems to be the dark purple or blue so often seen in smoke. The Poet Laureate uses the word "azure" to describe the colour of ascending columns of smoke ("azure pillars of the hearth arise to thee"): the colour here would be darker, the smoke not arising from peaceful dwellings, but generated among death-giving elements. The army is mainly of horsemen, and they are described as resolute and relentless: we are reminded of somewhat similar features in the Chaldean armies spoken of by Habakkuk, "I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation: they are terrible and dreadful: their horses also are swifter than leopards," &c. (<a href="/context/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them.</span> That is, according to the description following, not "thus, in such numbers as I have described." <span class="cmt_word">Having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having," probably refers to both horses and riders, though it may refer to the riders only. The Revised Version renders <span class="accented">jacinth</span> more exactly as <span class="accented">hyacinth.</span> Alford translates, "breastplates, fiery red, fuliginous, and sulphureous." It seems to be rightly concluded that the <span class="accented">hyacinhine</span> hue answers to the "smoke" further on in the verse. "The expression, 'of jacinth,' applied to the breastplate, is descriptive simply of a <span class="accented">hyacinthine, i.e.</span> dark-purple colour" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The description intensifies the terrible nature of the vision, and it is doubtful whether these details should be pressed to a particular interpretation. If they bear any meaning at all, they seem to point to the doom in wait for the wicked, whose portion is fire and brimstone (cf. <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">proceedeth fire</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Here, as in the preceding clause, the intention is evidently to enhance the terrible appearance of the vision. The "smoke" corresponds to the <span class="accented">hyacinth</span> hue, mentioned in the previous part of the verse (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). The horses, in accordance with a well-known poetic figure, are said to breathe out "fire and smoke." Brimstone is mentioned in addition, in order to set forth plainly the fact that their acts are directed against the wicked (cf. <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>; <a href="/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; <a href="/luke/17-29.htm">Luke 17:29</a>). Lions' teeth are mentioned in the description of tire locusts, with the same purpose (ver. 9). It is difficult to see why Alford should imagine that the <span class="accented">fire, smoke</span>, and <span class="accented">brimstone</span> proceed separately from different divisions of the host: it was not so in the case of the breastplates. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Now]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
