The "loud voice" signifies clarity and urgency, ensuring that the message is heard by all. The "throne" represents God's sovereign rule and authority, a recurring theme in Revelation, symbolizing His ultimate control over the events described. This echoes similar proclamations in Revelation, such as in 11:15, where voices from heaven announce the kingdom of God.<p><b>Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man:</b><br>This statement fulfills the prophetic vision of God dwelling among His people, as seen in the Old Testament, particularly in <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>. The term "dwelling place" (Greek: "sk&#275;n&#275;") is reminiscent of the tabernacle, where God's presence was with Israel during their wilderness journey. This signifies a return to the intimate relationship between God and humanity, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden before the fall.<p><b>and He will dwell with them:</b><br>The promise of God's presence is a central theme throughout Scripture, from the tabernacle and temple in the Old Testament to the incarnation of Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us"). This phrase assures believers of God's eternal presence, a fulfillment of the Emmanuel prophecy ("God with us") found in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and reiterated in <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>.<p><b>They will be His people:</b><br>This covenantal language reflects the relationship God established with Israel (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). It signifies a restored and perfected community of believers, transcending ethnic and national boundaries, united as God's chosen people. This echoes the promise in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, where believers are described as the temple of the living God.<p><b>and God Himself will be with them as their God:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and direct relationship between God and His people, free from the barriers of sin and separation. It fulfills the ultimate promise of the new covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God declares He will be their God, and they will be His people. This reflects the consummation of God's redemptive plan, where He is fully present with His people in the new creation, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His presence and relationship with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Refers to humanity, with whom God will dwell.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/throne.htm">Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's authority and the source of the proclamation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice.htm">Voice</a></b><br>Represents divine communication, possibly an angel or God Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_jerusalem.htm">New Jerusalem</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the new heaven and new earth, where the New Jerusalem descends.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_for_relationship.htm">God's Desire for Relationship</a></b><br>God has always desired to dwell with His people, from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_fulfillment.htm">Restoration and Fulfillment</a></b><br>The verse signifies the ultimate restoration of the relationship between God and humanity, fulfilling His promises throughout Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god.htm">The Presence of God</a></b><br>God's presence brings peace, security, and identity to His people.

The tent, or tabernacle, is in the seer's mind. There is a difference in the prepositions used here and in Revelation 7 : in the latter, God was spoken of as tabernacling <span class= "ital">over</span> them; here He tabernacles with them. He not only stretches His cloud-shelter over them, but He is with them. <span class= "ital">They shall be His people, and He shall be God with them, their God.</span> The introduction of the words in italics ("and be") in our version is a weakness; the force of the thought is spoiled. <span class= "ital">They</span> are God's people, and He is their Emmanuel--God with them, their God. The prophet Ezekiel supplies parallel thoughts (<a href="/context/ezekiel/37-27.htm" title="My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Ezekiel 37:27-28</a>; comp. also <a href="/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying.</span> <span class="accented">Out of the throne</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others; <span class="accented">out of heaven</span> is the reading of B, P, etc. As usual, the <span class="accented">voice</span> is described as a <span class="accented">great</span> voice (cf. <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>, etc.). It is not stated from whom the voice proceeds, but comp. <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he shall tabernacle with them.</span> Still the seer is influenced by the language of Ezekiel: "And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore" (<a href="/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>). Thus God makes his abode in his glorified Church - the New Jerusalem, among his spiritual Israel (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>, where this vision has been already anticipated). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be his peoples, and himself shall be God with them, their God.</span> The balance of authority is in favour of retaining the two last words, though they are omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and others. Evidently the same words as <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a> (see above), "My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people." Cf. "God with them" with "Emmanuel" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Now, the promise is redeemed in all its fulness. The plural "peoples" seems to point to the catholic nature of the New Jerusalem, which embraces many nations (cf. ver. 24; also <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
