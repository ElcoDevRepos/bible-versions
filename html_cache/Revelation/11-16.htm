This imagery is consistent with the structure of the heavenly throne room described in <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, where the elders are seen seated around God's throne. The number twenty-four may also reflect the divisions of the Levitical priesthood as outlined in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, suggesting a priestly role in worship and governance.<p><b>who sit on their thrones before God</b><br>The elders sitting on thrones indicates a position of authority and honor, suggesting that they share in God's rule and judgment. This imagery aligns with <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, where thrones are set in place for the heavenly court. The location "before God" emphasizes their proximity to the divine presence, highlighting their role as intermediaries between God and humanity. This setting underscores the heavenly order and the divine governance over creation.<p><b>fell on their faces</b><br>Falling on one's face is a common biblical expression of deep reverence and submission, often seen in the presence of divine revelation or glory. This act of prostration is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> when Abraham falls facedown before God, and in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>, where the prophet falls on his face at the vision of God's glory. It signifies humility and acknowledgment of God's supreme authority and holiness.<p><b>and worshiped God</b><br>Worship in this context is an act of adoration and reverence directed towards God, acknowledging His sovereignty and majesty. The worship of God by the elders is a recurring theme in Revelation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10-11 and 5</a>:14, where they continually praise God for His creation and redemptive work. This worship reflects the ultimate purpose of creation, as all beings are called to glorify God. The elders' worship also anticipates the eschatological fulfillment of God's kingdom, where His will is perfectly realized on earth as it is in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty-four_elders.htm">Twenty-Four Elders</a></b><br>These elders are symbolic figures often interpreted as representing the redeemed people of God, possibly the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles, signifying the unity of the Old and New Testaments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thrones.htm">Thrones</a></b><br>The thrones signify authority and judgment, indicating the elders' role in the divine council and their participation in God's governance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure of worship, representing the ultimate authority and the object of the elders' reverence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/worship.htm">Worship</a></b><br>The act of falling on their faces signifies deep reverence and submission to God's sovereignty and majesty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_scene.htm">Heavenly Scene</a></b><br>The setting is in the heavenly realm, emphasizing the divine and eternal nature of the events described.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_worship.htm">The Importance of Worship</a></b><br>Worship is a central theme in the life of a believer.

It is the same word which is rendered "seat" (<a href="/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-10.htm" title="And the fifth angel poured out his vial on the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,">Revelation 16:10</a>) when it refers to Satan; but it is better rendered <span class= "ital">throne</span> throughout, for by this variation of translation, as "Archbishop Trench has pointed out, two great ideas which run through this book, and, indeed, we may say through the whole of the New Testament, are obliterated: the one, that the true servants of Christ are crowned with Him and share His sovereignty; the other, that the antagonism of the Prince of Darkness to the Prince of Light develops itself in the hellish parody of the heavenly kingdom" (Prof. Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Revision of New Testament,</span> p. 41). It is specially desirable that this thought should be kept before us in this passage, which proclaims that the kingdom and throne and power of the wicked one have passed away, and the hour has come when the victorious saints may sit down with Christ in His throne (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four and twenty elders.</span> "The elders" represent the Church (see on Revelation 4:4); they are those who were made "a kingdom" (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>); they therefore fitly take up the burden of praise to him who has now established his universal and everlasting kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Which sat before God on their seats;</span> <span class="accented">which sit before God on their thrones</span> (Revised Version).
