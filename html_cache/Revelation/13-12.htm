The first beast is described earlier in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a> as having authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation, suggesting a global reach. The second beast's authority is derivative, emphasizing a partnership or alliance with the first beast. This reflects the idea of a counterfeit trinity, with the dragon (Satan) empowering the first beast (antichrist) and the second beast (false prophet) acting as a religious enforcer.<p><b>and caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast</b><br>The second beast's role is to direct worship towards the first beast, indicating a religious dimension to its authority. This mirrors the role of the Holy Spirit, who directs worship towards Christ, further emphasizing the counterfeit nature of this unholy trinity. The phrase "those who dwell on the earth" often refers to unbelievers in Revelation, contrasting with those whose citizenship is in heaven. This enforced worship could involve coercion, deception, or both, reflecting historical instances where political power has been used to enforce religious conformity.<p><b>whose mortal wound had been healed</b><br>The reference to the first beast's mortal wound being healed suggests a miraculous or seemingly supernatural event that garners awe and allegiance from the world. This could symbolize a political system or leader that appears to recover from a fatal setback, enhancing its legitimacy and power. The healing of the wound is a counterfeit resurrection, drawing a parallel to Christ's resurrection, which is central to Christian faith. This event serves to deceive the world, as it mimics the power of God, leading many to follow the beast in awe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_beast.htm">The Second Beast</a></b><br>Often referred to as the "false prophet," this beast exercises authority on behalf of the first beast and promotes its worship.

That is, his influence over men, though less directly asserted, is equal to that of the first beast. And he exercises this influence "in his sight," that is, by his permission and contemporaneously with the exercise of power by the first beast. So Christians both of St. John's and of our own time seek to escape direct persecution by justifying to themselves their unworthy compliance with the unrighteous requirements of the world. <span class="cmt_word">And causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span> Here we have an explanation of the two preceding clauses. Though like a lamb in appearance, his words denote his deadly nature, which is shown by causing men to worship the first beast; and thus he exercises the authority of the first beast, and accomplishes his work. Those who dwell in the earth are the worldly, not faithful Christians, but those "whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb" (see on ver. 8). This beast causes men to worship the first beast by persuading them into a compliance with his will, and making them pay homage to him.
