The term "behold" is a call to attention, urging believers to remain vigilant. The concept of "coming soon" reflects the early Christian expectation of an imminent return, which is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>. The urgency of this message serves as a reminder for believers to live in readiness and anticipation.<p><b>and My reward is with Me</b><br>This indicates that Christ will bring rewards with Him at His return. The idea of reward is consistent with biblical teachings on divine justice and recompense, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>. The reward is not merely a future promise but is tied to the presence of Christ Himself, suggesting that the ultimate reward is being in His presence.<p><b>to give to each one according to what he has done</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of individual accountability and judgment. It aligns with the biblical teaching that each person will be judged based on their deeds, as seen in <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>. This reflects the justice of God, who rewards righteousness and punishes wickedness. The emphasis on deeds does not negate salvation by grace but highlights the evidence of faith through works, as discussed in <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Jesus is the central figure of the Book of Revelation, emphasizing His imminent return and role as judge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the message, representing all believers who are awaiting Christ's return and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_coming.htm">The Second Coming</a></b><br>The event being anticipated, where Jesus will return to earth to establish His kingdom and execute judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/imminence_of_christ's_return.htm">Imminence of Christ's Return</a></b><br>Believers should live with the expectation that Jesus could return at any moment, influencing their daily decisions and priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_for_actions.htm">Accountability for Actions</a></b><br>Our deeds matter.
