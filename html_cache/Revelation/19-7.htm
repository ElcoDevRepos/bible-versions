The exhortation to rejoice and be glad is reminiscent of the Psalms, where worship and praise are central themes (e.g., <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>). The call to give God glory aligns with the biblical principle that all honor and praise belong to Him alone (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-29.htm">1 Chronicles 16:29</a>). This moment of celebration is in response to the fulfillment of God's promises and the culmination of His redemptive plan, as seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>For the marriage of the Lamb has come,</b><br>The marriage of the Lamb is a metaphor for the union between Christ (the Lamb) and His Church. This imagery is rooted in Jewish wedding customs, where a betrothal period is followed by a wedding feast. The Lamb refers to Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as the sacrificial Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>). The marriage signifies the completion of the covenant relationship between Christ and His followers, a theme that echoes the prophetic writings of Hosea and Isaiah, where God is portrayed as the husband of Israel.<p><b>and His bride has made herself ready.</b><br>The bride represents the Church, the collective body of believers. The preparation of the bride involves spiritual readiness and purity, symbolizing the sanctification process that believers undergo (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). This readiness is achieved through the righteousness imparted by Christ and the faithful living of His followers. The imagery of the bride making herself ready is also a call to holiness and perseverance, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), emphasizing the importance of being prepared for Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, symbolizing His sacrificial role in salvation.

This echoes the heavenly chorus earlier in the chapter where &#8220;a great multitude in heaven&#8221; shouts &#8220;Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Such rejoicing is the natural response of God&#8217;s people whenever His plan advances. <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a> urges, &#8220;This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.&#8221; Paul repeats the same sentiment, &#8220;Rejoice in the Lord always&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene in Revelation shows joy that is corporate, not private. Every believer is included&#8212;just as Jesus foretold when He said many will &#8220;come from the east and the west and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give Him the glory</b><p>&#8226; True celebration never centers on us.

Immediately after verse 7 we learn, &#8220;She was given clothing of fine linen, bright and pure&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), symbolizing &#8220;the righteous acts of the saints.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God supplies the garments, yet believers cooperate by living in obedience and expectancy. John writes, &#8220;Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus warned that only prepared followers enter the wedding feast (<a href="/matthew/25-10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>). <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a> reveals His goal: &#8220;to present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> paints a vivid, literal future scene: Heaven erupts in shared joy, all glory returns to God, and the long-anticipated wedding of Christ and His purified Church finally arrives.

This is somewhat anticipatory; the full vision of the bride of the Lamb is reserved until <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. But the rejoicing over Babylon and the harlot naturally suggests the allusion to Christ's faithful Church, just as the vision of <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. is suggested by the concluding words of <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. "The marriage of the Lamb" is the figure under which is depicted that complete union between Christ and his faithful Church, which will be consummated at the last day, when Satan has been overcome and sin destroyed. It stands in contrast with the fornication of the harlot - the union of the spiritually unfaithful portion of Christ's Church with the powers of the world (see on Revelation 17:1, 2). Alford remarks, "This figure, of a marriage between the Lord and his people, is too frequent and familiar to need explanation (cf. in the Old Testament, <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>, etc.; <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>, etc.; and in the New Testament, <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, etc.)." This symbol of the <span class="accented">wife</span> or <span class="accented">bride</span> indicates the redeemed, who have already in several places been alluded to in this book (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, "they that are with him").
