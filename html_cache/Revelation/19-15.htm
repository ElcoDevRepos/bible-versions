In biblical context, the sword often represents judgment and the Word of God (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). This phrase emphasizes the divine authority of Jesus, whose spoken word is sufficient to execute judgment. The sword from His mouth is a metaphor for the truth and justice that He proclaims, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where the Messiah strikes the earth with the rod of His mouth.<p><b>with which to strike down the nations</b><br>This indicates the universal scope of Christ's judgment. The nations represent all peoples and governments that oppose God's rule. The phrase reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>, where the Messiah is given the nations as His inheritance and exercises dominion over them. It underscores the theme of divine retribution against those who reject God's sovereignty.<p><b>and He will rule them with an iron scepter</b><br>The iron scepter symbolizes unbreakable and absolute authority. This imagery is drawn from <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, where the Messiah is prophesied to rule with a rod of iron, indicating firm and just governance. The use of iron suggests strength and the ability to crush opposition, highlighting the Messianic reign of Christ as both king and judge.<p><b>He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty</b><br>This vivid imagery of treading the winepress conveys the execution of divine judgment. In ancient times, a winepress was used to crush grapes, symbolizing the crushing of God's enemies. The phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, where God is depicted as treading the winepress alone, signifying His sole authority in judgment. The wrath of God the Almighty emphasizes the seriousness and inevitability of divine justice against sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the one from whose mouth the sharp sword proceeds.

The omission of the epithet in this passage, which describes the Word of God as the conqueror and the judge, is not without significance. The sword is now wielded for but one work--the word that Christ spoke will judge men at the last day (<a href="/john/12-48.htm" title="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.">John 12:48</a>). The power of this word found an illustration in the falling back of the hostile band which came to take Him in the day of His humiliation (<a href="/john/18-5.htm" title="They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.">John 18:5</a>); yet more gloriously will the power of His word be felt (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm" title="Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?">Jeremiah 23:29</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>) when He will slay the wicked with the word of His mouth. The passage in <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> must be borne in mind. Christ comes as King; His is a rule in righteousness; those who oppose this kingdom of righteousness find the shepherd's staff as a rod of iron; the stone rejected falls upon the builders, and grinds them to powder. It is thus that the winepress of God's wrath is set up, and the righteous King appears as one who treads it out. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1-3</a>.) <span class= "ital">He</span> Himself (the emphasis lies here) treads it. We have again the figure of the vintage made use of.
