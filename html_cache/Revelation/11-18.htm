Throughout biblical history, nations have often resisted God's plans, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed. This enmity is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, highlighting the spiritual battle between God's kingdom and worldly powers. The rage of the nations can also be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>, where He warns that the world will hate His followers because it first hated Him.<p><b>and Your wrath has come.</b><br>God's wrath is a central theme in eschatological passages, representing His righteous judgment against sin and rebellion. This wrath is not arbitrary but a response to the persistent rejection of His authority and grace. <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a> speaks of God's wrath being revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness. In Revelation, God's wrath culminates in the final judgment, as seen in the bowls of wrath poured out in <a href="/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>. This phrase underscores the certainty and imminence of divine judgment.<p><b>The time has come to judge the dead</b><br>This indicates the final judgment, where all individuals, living and dead, will be held accountable for their deeds. <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> speaks of a resurrection to either everlasting life or shame and everlasting contempt, pointing to this moment of judgment. The concept of judgment is also echoed in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which states that people are destined to die once and then face judgment. This phrase assures believers that justice will ultimately be served.<p><b>and to reward Your servants the prophets,</b><br>The prophets, who often faced persecution and rejection, are promised a reward for their faithfulness. This reward is consistent with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>, where He encourages those persecuted for righteousness to rejoice, for their reward in heaven is great. The prophets' role as God's messengers is honored, affirming the value of their obedience and perseverance in delivering God's word.<p><b>as well as the saints and those who fear Your name,</b><br>This includes all believers who have lived in reverence and obedience to God. The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God's purposes, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>. Fearing God's name implies a deep respect and awe for His holiness and authority, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of God's reward for all who are faithful, regardless of their status.<p><b>both small and great&#8212;</b><br>This highlights the impartiality of God's judgment and reward. In God's kingdom, earthly status and achievements are irrelevant; what matters is one's faithfulness and relationship with Him. This principle is echoed in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus. The phrase assures believers that God's justice and grace extend to all, regardless of their worldly position.<p><b>and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the ultimate fate of those who have corrupted and harmed God's creation. The destruction of the earth can be understood both literally and metaphorically, referring to environmental degradation and moral corruption. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-13</a>, where the earth was filled with violence, leading to God's judgment through the flood. The phrase serves as a warning that those who persist in rebellion and destruction will face divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the collective groups of people and governments that oppose God and His purposes. In the context of Revelation, these are often seen as rebellious entities against God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wrath.htm">God's Wrath</a></b><br>This is the divine response to sin and rebellion. It signifies God's righteous judgment against those who oppose Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>This term encompasses all who have died, both righteous and unrighteous, who will face judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_the_prophets.htm">Servants the Prophets</a></b><br>These are individuals who have been called by God to deliver His messages throughout history. They are honored for their faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints_and_those_who_fear_your_name.htm">Saints and Those Who Fear Your Name</a></b><br>Refers to all believers who have lived in reverence and obedience to God, regardless of their status or influence.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_destroy_the_earth.htm">Those Who Destroy the Earth</a></b><br>This phrase can be interpreted as those who corrupt or harm God's creation, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's wrath is a response to the rebellion of the nations, affirming His sovereignty and justice.
