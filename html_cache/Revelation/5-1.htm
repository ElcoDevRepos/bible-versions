Scrolls were common in ancient times for recording important information. In biblical context, scrolls often symbolize divine revelation or prophecy, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>, where a scroll is given to the prophet containing words of lamentation and woe.<p><b>in the right hand of the One seated on the throne.</b><br>The right hand signifies power and authority, indicating that the scroll is under the control of God, who is sovereign. The One seated on the throne is God the Father, emphasizing His supreme authority over the events that are about to unfold. This imagery is consistent with other biblical visions of God's throne, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>.<p><b>It had writing on both sides</b><br>Writing on both sides suggests completeness and fullness, indicating that nothing more can be added to God's plan. This is reminiscent of the tablets of the Law given to Moses, which were inscribed on both sides (<a href="/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>). It underscores the comprehensive nature of the divine decree contained within the scroll.<p><b>and was sealed with seven seals.</b><br>The number seven in biblical literature often symbolizes perfection or completeness. Seals were used in ancient times to secure documents and ensure their contents remained confidential until the appointed time for their opening. The seven seals indicate that the scroll's contents are perfectly secured and will be revealed in God's perfect timing. This concept of sealing is also seen in <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, where Daniel is instructed to seal the words of the prophecy until the time of the end.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/him_who_sat_on_the_throne.htm">Him who sat on the throne</a></b><br>This refers to God the Father, the sovereign ruler of the universe, who is depicted as sitting on the throne in heaven, symbolizing His authority and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The scroll</a></b><br>A significant object in this vision, the scroll is written on both sides and sealed with seven seals.

Revelation immediately introduces that authorized Person: &#8220;The Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8230;has prevailed to open the scroll&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).

Far from chaos, the future unfolds exactly as the Father has decreed and the Son will execute.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And I saw in the right hand </span>. . .--Better, <span class= "ital">And I saw on</span> (not "in;" the roll lay on the open palm of the hand) <span class= "ital">the right hand of Him that sitteth upon the throne a book written within and behind, fast sealed with seven seals.</span> The book is, of course, in the form of a roll; it lies on the open hand of the Throned One; it was not His will that the book should be kept from any. It is written, not on the inside only, as was the usual way, but, like the roll of the book which Ezekiel saw (<a href="/context/ezekiel/2-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>), it was written within and without. Some have thought that there are two divisions of predictions --those written within the roll, and those written on the outer side. This is merely fanciful; the passage in Ezekiel which supplies a guidance to the meaning might have shown the erroneousness of the thought. Clearly the "lamentation and mourning and woe" inscribed all over Ezekiel's roll indicate the filling up of sorrows: here the same overflowing writing indicates the completeness of the contents; there was no room for addition to that which was written therein. But what is meant by the book? Numberless interpretations have been offered: it is the Old Testament; it is the whole Bible; it is the title-deed of man's inheritance<span class= "bld">;</span> it is the book containing the sentence of judgment on the foes of the faith; it is the Apocalypse; it is part of the Apocalypse; it is the book of God's purposes and providence. There is a truth underlying most of these interpretations, but most of them narrow the force of the vision. If we say it is the book which unfolds the principles of God's government--in a wide sense, the book of salvation (comp. <a href="/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25-26</a>)-- the interpretation of life, which Christ alone can bestow (see <a href="/context/revelation/5-3.htm" title="And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.">Revelation 5:3-6</a>), we shall include, probably, the practical truths which underlie each of these interpretations; for all--Old Testament and New, man's heritage and destiny, God's purposes and providence-- are dark, till He who is the Light unfolds those truths which shed a light on all. Such a book becomes one "which contains and interprets human history," and claims the kingdoms of the earth for God. The aim of all literature has been said by a distinguished critic to be little more than the criticism of life; the book which Christ unfolds is the key to the true meaning of life. The roll is not the Apocalypse so much as the book of those truths which are exemplified in the Apocalypse, as in a vast chamber of imagery. The roll was fast sealed, so that even those who were wise and learned enough to read it had it been unrolled could not do so (See <a href="/isaiah/29-11.htm" title="And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:">Isaiah 29:11</a>.) There are things which are hidden from the wise and prudent, but revealed unto babes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> As in <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, this phrase introduces a new incident in the vision. That which had been witnessed remained, but a further development now takes place. <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. relates the revelation of the glory of the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2) surrounded by his Church and creation. The glory of Jesus Christ, the Lamb, is now set forth, since he is the only One worthy to receive and declare to his Church the mystery contained in the sealed book. <span class="cmt_word">In the right hand</span>; <span class="accented">upon the right hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>). That is, lying upon the hand, as it was extended in the act of offering the book to any one who should be able to open and read it. <span class="cmt_word">Of him that sat on the throne</span>. The Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). <span class="cmt_word">A book written within and on the back side</span>. In <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9, 10</a> the "roll of a book" is "written within and without;" another of the numerous traces in the Revelation of the influence of the writings of this prophet upon the writer of the Apocalypse, though the picture of the Lamb, which follows in this chapter, imparts a new feature peculiar to St. John's vision. The roll was inscribed on both sides. Mention is made of such a roll by Pliny, JuVenal, Lucian, Martial, though Grotius connects <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "on the back," with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "sealed," thus rendering, "written within and sealed on the back." The fulness of the book, and the guard of <span class="accented">seven</span> seals which are opened in succession, denote completeness of revelation (on the number <span class="accented">seven</span> as denoting full completion, see on Revelation 1:4). This book contained the whole of "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>). It is noteworthy that - so far as we can gather from the Revelation - the book is never read. The breaking of each seal is accompanied by its own peculiar phenomena, which appear to indicate the nature of the contents. And the opening of the seventh seal especially is attended by a compound series of events; but nowhere are we explicitly informed of the contents of the book. Alford well remarks, "Not its contents, but the gradual steps of access to it, are represented by these visions." This view seems to be held also by Schleiermacher. Dusterdieck considers that the roll is never read, though the incidents attending the opening of each seal portray a portion of the contents. Wordsworth and Elliott understand that, as each seal is broken, a part of the roll is unrolled and its contents rendered visible; and these contents are symbolically set forth by the events which then take place. According to this view, the whole is a prophecy extending to the end of the world. The popular idea is that the roll was sealed along the edge with seven seals, all visible at the same time. If, as each seal was broken, a portion of the roll could be unfolded, of course only one seal - the outermost - could be visible. This is not, however, inconsistent with St. John's assertion that there were <span class="accented">seven</span> seals - a fact which he might state from his knowledge gained by witnessing the opening of the seven in succession. The truth seems to lie midway between these views. We must remember that the Revelation was vouchsafed to the Church as an encouragement to her members to persevere under much suffering and tribulation, and as a support to their faith, lest they should succumb to the temptation of despair, and, unable to fathom the eternal purposes of God, should doubt his truth or his ability to aid them. But we are nowhere led to believe that it was the intention of God to reveal <span class="accented">all</span> things to man, even under the cloak of symbolism or allegory. There is much which must necessarily be withheld until after the end of all earthly things; and, just as no mortal can possibly know the "new name" (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>), so no one on earth can receive perfect knowledge of the "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," which were symbolically contained in the book, and which, through the intervention of the Lamb, may one day be published; though a portion - sufficient for the time - was shadowed forth, at the opening of the seals; which portion, indeed, could never have been given to us except through the Lamb. We understand, therefore, that the book is symbolical of the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the mysteries of God; that, as a whole, the contents of the book are not, nor indeed can be, revealed to us while on earth; but that some small but sufficient portion of these mysteries are made known to us by the power of Christ, who will eventually make all things clear hereafter, when we shall know even as we are known (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). The events attending the opening of the seals are therefore a prophecy of the relations of the Church and the world to the end of time. Many opinions have been held as to the antitype of the book. Victorinus thinks it to be the Old Testament, the meaning of which Christ was the first to unlock. And Bede and others consider that the writing within signified the New Testament, and that on the back, the Old. Todd and De Burgh think the roll denotes the office of our Lord, by virtue of which he will judge the world. <span class="cmt_word">Sealed with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">sealed down with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">close sealed</span> (Revised Version).
