It was less prominent than other cities mentioned in Revelation but was significant for its economic activities, particularly in textiles and dyeing. The church in Thyatira was one of the seven churches addressed in Revelation, and this message is directed to those who remained faithful amidst false teachings. The phrase indicates a direct communication from Christ to the believers who have not succumbed to the errors present in their community.<p><b>who do not hold to her teaching</b><br>The "her" refers to Jezebel, a symbolic name used for a woman in the church who was promoting false teachings and leading believers astray. This alludes to the Old Testament figure Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab, who led Israel into idolatry and immorality. The faithful in Thyatira are commended for not adhering to these corrupt teachings, which likely involved compromising Christian values with pagan practices.<p><b>and have not learned the so-called deep things of Satan</b><br>This phrase suggests that the false teachings being spread were presented as advanced or deeper spiritual knowledge, a common tactic in Gnostic beliefs. These "deep things" were likely deceptive doctrines that contradicted the true gospel. The reference to Satan highlights the spiritual danger and deception involved, emphasizing that these teachings were not merely misguided but were fundamentally opposed to God.<p><b>I will place no further burden upon you</b><br>This assurance echoes the decision made at the Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the apostles decided not to impose additional burdens on Gentile believers beyond essential requirements. Here, Christ reassures the faithful in Thyatira that they are not required to do more than remain steadfast in their faith and avoid the false teachings. It is a promise of relief and encouragement to continue in their current path of faithfulness without additional obligations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thyatira.htm">Thyatira</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, known for its trade guilds and commerce.

The "and" after "I say" in the Authorized Version is a false reading, which it shares with the Vulgate and Luther: "to you" and "to the rest" are in apposition. Which know not the deep things of Satan, as they say.

The nominative to "say" may be either the faithful in Thyatira, "who have not this doctrine," and who show their detestation of it by calling it "the deep things of Satan;" or the holders of this doctrine, who profess to be in the possession of profound knowledge of a mysterious kind.
