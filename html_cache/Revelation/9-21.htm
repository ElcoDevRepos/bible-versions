The call to repentance is a central theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing God's desire for humanity to turn from sin and seek forgiveness (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). The refusal to repent despite witnessing divine judgments echoes the stubbornness of Pharaoh in Exodus, who repeatedly hardened his heart against God&#8217;s signs and wonders.<p><b>of their murder</b><br>Murder, the unlawful taking of life, is condemned throughout Scripture, beginning with the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). In the context of Revelation, this may refer to both literal acts of violence and the spiritual murder of hatred (1 <a href="/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a>). The prevalence of murder in the end times reflects a society that has rejected God's law and embraced chaos and lawlessness.<p><b>sorcery</b><br>The term "sorcery" is translated from the Greek word "pharmakeia," which can refer to the use of drugs, potions, or magical arts. In the ancient world, sorcery was often associated with idolatry and the manipulation of spiritual forces. The Bible consistently condemns such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), as they represent a reliance on powers other than God. This highlights the spiritual deception prevalent in the end times.<p><b>sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality encompasses a range of behaviors outside the boundaries of biblical sexual ethics, which are rooted in the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>). The prevalence of such immorality in Revelation reflects a society that has abandoned God's design for human relationships, paralleling the moral decline seen in the days of Noah and Lot (<a href="/luke/17-26.htm">Luke 17:26-30</a>).<p><b>and theft</b><br>Theft, the act of taking what does not belong to oneself, violates the commandment "You shall not steal" (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). In the context of Revelation, theft may symbolize not only physical stealing but also the broader injustice and exploitation characterizing the end times. This reflects a world where materialism and greed have supplanted righteousness and justice.<br><br>Each of these sins represents a rejection of God's commandments and a refusal to acknowledge His authority. The persistence in these behaviors despite divine warnings underscores the depth of human rebellion and the need for divine intervention to restore righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unrepentant_people.htm">The Unrepentant People</a></b><br>This verse refers to those who, despite the plagues and judgments described earlier in Revelation, refuse to repent of their sins.
