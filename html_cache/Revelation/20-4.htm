In biblical context, thrones often represent divine or kingly authority (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>). The seated individuals are granted authority to judge, which aligns with the promise to the apostles in <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, where Jesus tells them they will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. This scene is part of the millennial reign, a period of Christ's rule on earth, reflecting the fulfillment of God's kingdom promises.<p><b>And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God,</b><br>This phrase highlights the martyrs who suffered death for their faith. Beheading was a common form of execution in the Roman Empire, indicating the historical persecution faced by early Christians. Their testimony and adherence to the word of God underscore their faithfulness and the cost of discipleship (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). This vision assures believers that their sacrifices are honored and that they will be vindicated.<p><b>and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands.</b><br>This part refers to those who resisted the Antichrist's demands during the tribulation period. The beast and its image symbolize the ultimate rebellion against God, as described in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. The mark on the forehead or hand represents allegiance to the beast, contrasting with the seal of God on believers (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>). This resistance signifies spiritual victory and faithfulness to God amidst persecution.<p><b>And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</b><br>This phrase describes the first resurrection, where the faithful are brought to life to reign with Christ during the millennium. The thousand-year reign is a literal period where Christ establishes His kingdom on earth, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>. This reign represents the ultimate triumph of good over evil and the realization of God's promises to His people.

There is a prominence given to the <span class= "ital">thrones, </span>because the thought of the reign of the saints is uppermost in the mind of the seer. The thrones are seen, and those who sat on them. It has been asked, "By whom are the thrones occupied?" The answer is supplied in the latter part of the verse. Those who are in the latter part said to reign with Christ are clearly those who sit upon the thrones which first caught the prophet's eye; these are all the real servants of God. They appear before the seer in two great classes:--First, the martyrs who have been faithful unto death; for he speaks first of seeing <span class= "ital">the souls of those who have been beheaded</span> (strictly, "slain with the axe," but clearly the special class of beheaded martyrs is to be taken as representing all), <span class= "ital">because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God.</span> The number of the martyrs is now complete (comp. <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>); these form the first class mentioned. Secondly, those who have been faithful in life occupy these thrones. The prophet sees these, even <span class= "ital">whosoever did not worship</span> (during life) <span class= "ital">the wild beast, nor yet his image, and did not receive the mark</span> (comp. <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm" title="He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.">Revelation 13:10</a>) <span class= "ital">on their forehead and upon their hand.</span> The triumph and sovereignty, whatever they be, are shared by all the faithful. These things are stated as constituting their privileges. They lived, whereas the rest of the dead lived not; they reigned, and judgment was given them. This last has been felt to be a difficulty. What sort of judgment is intended? The passage in Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-22.htm" title="Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.">Daniel 7:22</a>) is clearly suggestive of the present one. The phrase (judgment was given) is not there to be understood as meaning that right was done them (see Note in <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary</span> on Daniel), neither must it be so understood here. Judicial powers are given to the saints as to those who occupy thrones; "the chief power in governing" (Gebhardt) is given them (comp. <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>, and <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1Corinthians 6:2-3</a>); they reign, they judge, they live; the true and full powers of life are seen to be theirs. And is not this the case always? Who, next to Him who knows the secrets of our hearts, exercises judicial powers over men? Do not those whose lives, as we read them, rebuke our own? Truly, those who lived for God, and refused the mark of earthliness, reign and judge us in our worldliness and weakness. This is their sovereign honour here, besides the glad reign in the unseen world. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.</span> This describes the position of Christians in this life. They sit upon thrones; that is, they reign with Christ. Judgment is given unto them; that is, by their conduct in the world the world is judged and condemned. St. John continually thus describes the Christian's position; and such a picture is specially applicable for his purpose here, which is to portray the glory of the Christian calling, and the certainty of the Christian's hope. The redeemed have been made kings, and reign (<a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). So also St. Paul says we are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands.</span> This is a special reference to the martyrs made with the object mentioned above, viz. that of encouraging Christians in their warfare. The class here described forms part of the whole body of Christians alluded to in the first part of the verse (cf. <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; also <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>). In the same way the <span class="accented">souls</span> referred to in <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> are those existing during the period of this world, which we have here understood to be denoted indirectly by the "thousand years." <span class="cmt_word">And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</span> "The thousand years" adopted in the Textus Receptus, is found in B and others, but omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others. "They lived and reigned with Christ" in complete and perfect assurance, as in ver. 2, and for the reason given in ver. 2, viz. that, Satan was bound completely. This living and reigning must not be limited to the period after the death of the martyrs (though it is doubtless true in this sense also), notwithstanding the fact that St. John sees them here after their death. It is as though he would say, "You Christians sit upon thrones and reign with Christ; yea, even those who suffered shameful deaths shared this perfect safety and exaltation, though to the eyes of the world they were so afflicted and degraded." <span class="accented">They lived</span> is described in ver. 5 as the "first resurrection." This can only be referred to that first awakening from sin to the glorious life of the gospel, which St. John elsewhere describes in a similar manner. "He that heareth my Word... hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life" (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>); "We have passed from death unto life" (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] thrones,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(thronous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2362.htm">Strong's 2362: </a> </span><span class="str2">From thrao; a stately seat; by implication, power or a potentate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">those seated</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#940;&#952;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekathisan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2523.htm">Strong's 2523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Another form for kathezomai; to seat down, i.e. Set; intransitively, to sit; figuratively, to settle.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(ep&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1909.htm">Strong's 1909: </a> </span><span class="str2">On, to, against, on the basis of, at. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
