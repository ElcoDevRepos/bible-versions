Historically, this can be linked to the Roman Empire's persecution of early Christians, where many were martyred for their faith. The "woman" is often interpreted as representing a corrupt system or city, such as Babylon, which symbolizes opposition to God and His people. The "saints and witnesses for Jesus" refers to those who have remained faithful to their testimony of Christ, even unto death. This phrase echoes the earlier visions in Revelation where the souls of martyrs cry out for justice (<a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9-11</a>). The imagery of blood also connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where blood was a symbol of life and atonement, contrasting the life-giving blood of Christ with the destructive bloodshed of the saints.<p><b>And I was utterly amazed at the sight of her.</b><br>The reaction of being "utterly amazed" indicates a profound shock or bewilderment at the vision. This amazement could stem from the stark contrast between the woman's opulent appearance and her gruesome actions. It reflects the seductive and deceptive nature of evil, which can appear alluring yet is ultimately destructive. The apostle John's amazement may also highlight the unexpected nature of persecution and the extent of the woman's influence. This reaction can be compared to other biblical instances where prophets are overwhelmed by visions, such as Daniel's visions in the Old Testament (<a href="/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15, 28</a>). The amazement underscores the gravity of the vision and the need for discernment among believers to recognize and resist the corrupting influences of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolic of a corrupt and idolatrous system, often interpreted as representing a false religious entity or a city that leads people away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blood_of_the_saints.htm">The Blood of the Saints</a></b><br>Represents the persecution and martyrdom of those who remain faithful to Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses_for_jesus.htm">Witnesses for Jesus</a></b><br>Refers to believers who testify to the truth of the Gospel, often at great personal cost.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who receives this vision and is astonished by what he sees.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation given to John, depicting the spiritual battle between good and evil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to persecution and suffering, as seen in the lives of the saints and witnesses.

She is not merely guilty; she is saturated and stupefied by her sin, just as literal drunkenness overwhelms and controls (<a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never dismisses evil as abstract. Just as the Beast is an actual future ruler (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1-8</a>; 17:11-13), this woman is the literal embodiment of a counterfeit faith that will dominate global culture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the blood of the saints and witnesses for Jesus</b><p>The intoxicant in her cup is horrific: &#8220;the blood of the saints.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Saints&#8221; are believers set apart in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>).

John&#8217;s stunned reaction underscores both the ugliness of persecution and the deceptive glamour of evil. For today&#8217;s church, the verse warns against compromise, prepares us for possible suffering, and steadies our hope: the Lamb sees, remembers, and will judge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus;</span> <span class="accented">of the witnesses</span> (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>). Another point of contrast between this <span class="accented">woman</span> and the woman of <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>; the former persecutes, the latter is persecuted. It may be asked - How can these words be applied to professing Christians, as they must be, if such be the interpretation of the "harlot"? The answer may be found in Jeremiah. In <a href="/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33, 34</a> and Jeremiah 3:1-11 we find the origin of this passage. Judah is a harlot (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1, 8</a>) with a sign upon her forehead (<a href="/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>), who causes transgression in others (<a href="/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>; and compare above, "Mother of harlots "), and in whose "skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents" (<a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>). She is clothed in crimson (<a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) and golden ornaments (cf. <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>); her lovers will despise her (<a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) and seek her life (cf. <a href="/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>). Just as it was declared that in Judah was found the blood of the innocent poor, so here we are told that the faithless part of the Church is guilty of the blood of the saints. The reason is found in the inscription. The harlot is absolutely identified with Babylon. No distinction in guilt can be allowed between the openly hostile world and the faithless Christian. "He that is not with me," God declares, "is against me" (<a href="/matthew/12-20.htm">Matthew 12:20</a>). The description "drunken with," etc., is similar to that of Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>; and also in <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration;</span> <span class="accented">with a great wonder</span> (Revised Version). Probably because the seer can scarcely realize that some who are professing Christians must be held guilty of such enormities; that the harlot, representing a portion of the Church, faithless even though it be, should be classed with the world, as represented by Babylon and the beast. Perhaps the <span class="accented">wonder</span> is caused by the fact that such a thing should ever be permitted to be; this leading to the following explanation, which shows how the unfaithfulness is avenged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I could see that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
