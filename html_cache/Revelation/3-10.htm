The command to persevere refers to maintaining faith and obedience despite trials and persecution. This perseverance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a> and <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>, emphasizing the importance of steadfastness in the Christian walk. The church's endurance is a testament to their commitment to Christ's teachings and their ability to withstand external pressures.<p><b>I will also keep you from the hour of testing</b><br>This promise of protection is significant, suggesting divine intervention to shield believers from a specific period of trial. The "hour of testing" is often interpreted as a future time of tribulation, possibly linked to eschatological events described in Revelation. This assurance echoes the protection God provides to His people throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3-7</a>. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ's deliverance, reflecting His role as a protector and savior.<p><b>that is about to come upon the whole world</b><br>The scope of the testing is global, indicating a widespread event affecting all humanity. This aligns with prophetic literature that speaks of end-times scenarios impacting the entire earth, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>. The universality of the testing underscores the comprehensive nature of God's plan and the ultimate fulfillment of His purposes.<p><b>to test those who dwell on the earth</b><br>The purpose of the testing is to reveal the true character and faith of individuals. This concept of testing is prevalent in biblical narratives, where trials serve to refine and prove the faithfulness of God's people, as illustrated in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>. The phrase "those who dwell on the earth" often refers to unbelievers or those opposed to God's kingdom, contrasting with the faithful who are promised protection. This testing serves as a means of divine judgment and separation between the righteous and the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the church in Philadelphia.

"Temptation" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) generally has no article in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>, etc.; comp. especially <a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>). Here it has the article, as if "the temptation" were to be of no ordinary kind. The word does not occur elsewhere in St. John's writings. In order to bring substantive and verb into harmony, the Revised Version renders <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> "trial," the word for "to try" being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "World" here is not the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the ordered universe" (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>), but the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "the inhabited earth" (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>). The phrase, "to dwell upon the earth," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, is peculiar to the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-10.htm">Revelation 11:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8, 14</a>). "The hour of trial" seems to be that which Christ had foretold should precede his coming, especially the triumph of antichrist. Hence the declaration in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have kept</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#964;&#942;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(et&#275;r&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5083.htm">Strong's 5083: </a> </span><span class="str2">From teros; to guard, i.e. To note; by implication, to detain; by extension, to withhold; by extension, to withhold.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
