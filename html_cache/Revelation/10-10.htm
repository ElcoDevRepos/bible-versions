The small scroll represents a message or revelation from God, similar to the scroll in <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-3</a>:3, where Ezekiel is also instructed to eat a scroll. The act of taking the scroll from the angel signifies the acceptance of God's word and the responsibility to proclaim it. The angel, often seen as a messenger of God, emphasizes the divine origin of the message.<p><b>and ate it</b><br>Eating the scroll symbolizes internalizing God's message, making it a part of oneself. This act is not just about understanding but also about embodying and living out the message. In biblical times, eating was often associated with covenant and commitment, suggesting a deep, personal engagement with God's word. This mirrors the experience of prophets who internalized God's messages to deliver them to the people.<p><b>and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth</b><br>The sweetness of the scroll reflects the initial joy and delight in receiving God's word. Honey, often used in the Bible to describe something desirable and pleasant (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>), signifies the goodness and truth of God's revelation. This sweetness can also represent the hope and promise contained within God's message, as seen in the prophecies of redemption and restoration.<p><b>But when I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter</b><br>The bitterness in the stomach signifies the difficult and often painful reality of delivering God's message, especially when it involves judgment or calls for repentance. This duality of sweetness and bitterness reflects the complexity of God's word, which can bring both comfort and challenge. The experience of bitterness is akin to the prophet's burden, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16-18</a>, where the joy of God's word is accompanied by personal suffering and lament. This highlights the cost of true prophetic ministry, which involves both the joy of revelation and the pain of its implications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives and records the visions given to him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A mighty angel who stands with one foot on the sea and one on the land, symbolizing authority over the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_small_scroll.htm">The Small Scroll</a></b><br>A scroll given to John to eat, symbolizing the reception and internalization of God's message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_eating.htm">The Act of Eating</a></b><br>Represents the acceptance and internalization of God's prophetic word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sweetness_and_bitterness.htm">Sweetness and Bitterness</a></b><br>Symbolizes the dual nature of God's word&#8212;its initial sweetness and the subsequent bitterness of its implications.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dual_nature_of_god's_word.htm">The Dual Nature of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is both sweet and bitter.

Earlier we read, &#8220;He held a little scroll open in his hand&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>). The angel stands under God&#8217;s authority, so receiving the scroll shows that the message ultimately comes from God Himself. A similar scene occurs when Ezekiel is told, &#8220;Open your mouth and eat what I give you&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>). Jeremiah also &#8220;took the scroll&#8221; from Baruch and delivered it to the officials (<a href="/jeremiah/36-14.htm">Jeremiah 36:14&#8211;15</a>). God&#8217;s Word is not optional; it is handed to the servant, who must accept it exactly as given.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ate it</b><p>Taking the scroll is not enough; John must &#8220;eat&#8221; it. Scripture often uses eating to picture internalizing God&#8217;s truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1&#8211;3</a> records the prophet literally eating a scroll so that he can then &#8220;go and speak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a> says, &#8220;When Your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart&#8217;s delight.&#8221;<p>To eat is to make the message part of oneself&#8212;mind, heart, and life. John&#8217;s prophetic ministry will flow out of what he has taken in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth</b><p>The first taste of God&#8217;s Word is delightful.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a> testifies, &#8220;How sweet are Your words to my taste&#8212;sweeter than honey to my mouth!&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> says the Lord&#8217;s judgments are &#8220;sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.&#8221;<p>Why the sweetness?<p>&#8211; God reveals His glory and grace.<p>&#8211; The righteous are vindicated.<p>&#8211; Christ&#8217;s kingdom is assured.<p>Hearing that God will finally set all things right is joyous news for every believer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But when I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter</b><p>Sweetness turns to bitterness once the full implications settle in. The same scroll that promises victory also announces judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a> reports, &#8220;I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit,&#8221; after eating his scroll, because he must preach judgment to a rebellious people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a> follows with the prophecy of the two witnesses, persecution, and woes&#8212;sobering realities for the earth.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself experienced this mix: joy set before Him, yet the bitterness of the cross (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p>For John, the message means tribulation for the world and suffering for saints before final triumph. The Word remains sweet, but its outworking can be painful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/10-10.htm">Revelation 10:10</a> shows the two&#8211;edged nature of God&#8217;s prophetic Word. John obediently receives and internalizes the angel&#8217;s scroll. Its sweetness reflects the glory, mercy, and ultimate victory it proclaims. Its bitterness comes from the judgments and hardships it contains for a rebellious world. Every servant of God who faithfully digests Scripture will feel that same blend&#8212;delight in God&#8217;s truth, yet sorrow over the cost that truth demands as it unfolds in history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">I took</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The Evangelist takes the roll, as he was bidden, out of the angel's hand, eats it up, and finds it, as he was told, "in his mouth as honey, sweet." In this his experience resembles that of Ezekiel, who found the roll in his mouth as honey for sweetness (<a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). So the Psalmist could rejoice in God's words and God's law as sweet, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm" title="How sweet are your words to my taste! yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!">Psalm 119:103</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm" title="More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.">Psalm 19:10</a>). He who is ready to endure bitterness in his fidelity to God must not only be interpenetrated by divine teaching; he must have also realised its sweetness, or else, however pleasant his words may sound, they will lack the sweetness which is as needful to the words of the teacher as to the songs of the poet. But the after effect of the sweet-tasting roll is bitterness. Ezekiel makes no mention of this bitterness; yet we know how much his fidelity to the words he loved so well must have cost him when he was bidden to arm himself with a flinty determination (<a href="/context/ezekiel/3-9.htm" title="As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:9-14</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6-7</a>), and the patient courage of one whose lot was among thorns and briars and scorpions. It must always be so. The love of Christ may constrain men, but the very ardour of their affections must bring them through tribulation, and may make them as outcasts, defamed, persecuted, slain. The flaming zeal to emancipate mankind from thraldoms, follies, and ruinous sins may stir the soul with a holy joy; but there come moments when men are almost tempted to turn back, and to think that they have undertaken a hopeless task, when they find how slow is their progress, and what new and unexpected difficulties arise. Such was the bitterness which Moses felt: "Why is it that Thou hast sent me? For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered thy people at all." The most enthusiastic souls who love their fellow-men, and who feel how sweet and high is their calling, perhaps feel most of this bitterness. Their very love makes all failure very bitter to bear; yet is it through this martyrdom of failure that the noblest victories are won.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter</span> (see above).
