In the context of Revelation, this loud voice signifies a divine message that demands attention. The angel's cry echoes the proclamations of the prophets in the Old Testament, such as the voice of God at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>) and the calls of the prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. This loud voice is a call to heed the message that follows, emphasizing its importance and urgency.<p><b>like the roar of a lion.</b><br>The comparison to a lion's roar suggests majesty, strength, and authority. In biblical symbolism, the lion is often associated with the tribe of Judah and, by extension, Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The roar of a lion can also symbolize the fearsome and awe-inspiring nature of God's voice, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, where the lion's roar is linked to the prophetic voice of God. This imagery underscores the power and sovereignty of the message being delivered.<p><b>And when he cried out,</b><br>The repetition of the cry emphasizes the significance of the message. It indicates a moment of divine revelation that is about to unfold. This phrase sets the stage for the subsequent events, highlighting the connection between the angel's proclamation and the response it elicits from the heavenly realm.<p><b>the seven thunders sounded their voices.</b><br>The seven thunders are a mysterious element in the book of Revelation. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in biblical literature, suggesting that these thunders convey a complete or perfect message from God. The thunders' voices may symbolize divine judgment or revelation, akin to the voice of God in <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, which is described as powerful and majestic. The fact that their message is not recorded (as seen in the following verses) adds to the mystery and suggests that some aspects of God's plan remain hidden from human understanding. This aligns with the theme of divine mystery and the unfolding of God's ultimate purposes throughout Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty_angel.htm">The Mighty Angel</a></b><br>This figure is described earlier in <a href="/revelation/10.htm">Revelation 10:1</a> as a powerful angel coming down from heaven, clothed in a cloud with a rainbow above his head.

It is a summons impossible to ignore, much like God&#8217;s own proclamations at Sinai, &#8220;there were thunders and lightnings&#8230; and a very loud trumpet blast&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s volume underscores urgency in the Tribulation timeline; Heaven is broadcasting warning and comfort before the seventh trumpet sounds (<a href="/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the roar of a lion</b><p>&#8226; A lion&#8217;s roar signals authority and impending action. Scripture often links God&#8217;s voice to a lion&#8217;s roar: &#8220;The LORD will roar from Zion&#8221; (<a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>), &#8220;They will follow the LORD; He will roar like a lion&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>), and &#8220;The Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison assures readers that the angel speaks with delegated divine authority; Heaven is not whispering&#8212;judgment and deliverance are on the horizon.<p>&#8226; A roar also generates fear and awe (<a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>), pressing hearts toward repentance before the final trumpet judgments intensify.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded their voices</b><p>&#8226; Thunder in Revelation often accompanies God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>) and the outworking of His judgments (<a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; 11:19; 16:18). Here the thunder is personified: it &#8220;sounded their voices,&#8221; indicating intelligent, purposeful communication.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Seven&#8221; consistently signals completeness. The seven thunders, therefore, reflect a full, divine response to the angel&#8217;s roar&#8212;Heaven&#8217;s perfect commentary on what has just been proclaimed.<p>&#8226; In the next verse John is told to seal up what the thunders say (<a href="/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>). Their message is literal yet deliberately withheld, reminding us that God controls both what He reveals and what He reserves (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear elsewhere: when the Father spoke audibly, some bystanders said it &#8220;had thundered&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28&#8211;29</a>). The pattern reinforces that God&#8217;s majestic voice can sound like thunder to human ears, underscoring His transcendence and our dependence on revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a> presents a mighty angel who shouts a lion-like roar, asserting Heaven&#8217;s authority over earth in the midst of the Tribulation. His cry is met by the seven thunders&#8212;God&#8217;s complete, yet undisclosed, response&#8212;signaling that decisive divine action is imminent. The verse calls readers to stand in awe of God&#8217;s power, trust the parts of His plan He has revealed, and humbly accept the mysteries He has held back for their appointed time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And cried with a loud voice . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and he cried with a loud voice, even as a lion roareth. </span>Another token of the presence of Christ with the Church.

Thus we have four sets of sevens. It was not a seven-fold peal of thunder, but seven thunders, which spake forth distinctly their own voices. This marked language brings the seven thunders, though their utterances are never revealed, into prominence as a portion of the Apocalyptic system. But what were these thunders? Were they more terrible judgments still? and did the sealing of them signify the shortening of the days of judgment, as Christ had said (<a href="/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>)? It may be so. One thing seems certain--the guesses which have been hazarded (such as that they are identical with the trumpets; that they are the seven crusades) can hardly be admitted. Whatever they were, they were perfectly intelligible to the Evangelist. He was on the point of writing down their utterances. Will this fact help us to understand the general object of their introduction here?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth;</span> <span class="accented">and be cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth</span> (Revised Version). What the angel <span class="accented">cried we</span> are apparently not told. Probably the whole incident is intended merely to set forth the powerful and terrible nature of the messenger who is to deliver God's message. The figure is a very common one with the prophetical writers (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>; <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices;</span> <span class="accented">and when he cried, the seven</span>, etc. (Revised Version). This, again, is a repetition of the idea contained in the preceding clause. The Jews were accustomed to call thunder the seven voices, and to regard it as the voice of the Lord (cf. the repetition in <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>.), in the same way that they regarded lightning as the fire of God (<a href="/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>). We have, therefore, most probably, a national idea of the Jews, made use of to express the simple fact of the loud and mighty character of the utterance of the angel (cf. the note on <span class="accented">Euphrates</span> in <a href="/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>). If this be so, it is unnecessary to seek for any more subtle interpretation of <span class="accented">the seven thunders</span>, as that they represent the seven crusades (Vitringa), etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he cried out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekraxen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cry aloud, shriek.
