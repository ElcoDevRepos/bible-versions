Throughout Scripture, God is depicted as having the power to influence the hearts and minds of individuals and nations (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). This divine influence is not coercive but aligns with His ultimate plan. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Exodus is a parallel example, where God's purposes are fulfilled through human decisions.<p><b>to carry out His purpose</b><br>God's purpose is central to the unfolding events in Revelation. This reflects the biblical theme that God's will is ultimately accomplished, despite human rebellion or satanic opposition (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). The purpose here involves the judgment and eventual downfall of Babylon, representing the corrupt world system opposed to God.<p><b>by uniting to give their kingdom to the beast</b><br>The "beast" is a symbol of oppressive political power, often interpreted as a future world leader or system in opposition to God. The uniting of kingdoms under the beast's authority suggests a temporary alliance of worldly powers. This mirrors the historical alliances seen in Daniel's visions (Daniel 7), where empires rise and fall under divine oversight.<p><b>until the words of God are fulfilled</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty of prophetic fulfillment. The "words of God" refer to the prophecies and promises throughout Scripture that detail the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom. This assurance is echoed in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>, where Jesus affirms the enduring truth of God's word. The fulfillment of these words is a testament to God's faithfulness and the reliability of biblical prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who orchestrates events to fulfill His divine purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/their_hearts.htm">Their Hearts</a></b><br>Refers to the kings or rulers who are influenced by God to act according to His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/royal_authority.htm">Royal Authority</a></b><br>The power and dominion that the rulers possess, which they relinquish to the beast.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of a powerful, evil entity or system opposed to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_words_of_god.htm">The Words of God</a></b><br>The prophetic declarations and promises found in Scripture that are destined to be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, even those that seem chaotic or evil.
