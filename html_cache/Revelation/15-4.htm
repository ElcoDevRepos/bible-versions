The rhetorical question implies that all creation should naturally fear and glorify God. The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with wisdom and reverence (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The glorification of God's name is a call to acknowledge His supreme authority and majesty, as seen in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a>). This reflects the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan where every knee will bow and every tongue confess His lordship (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>For You alone are holy.</b><br>This statement underscores the unique holiness of God, setting Him apart from all creation. Holiness in the biblical sense refers to God's purity, moral perfection, and separateness from sin. The declaration that God alone is holy is a central tenet of biblical theology, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim God's holiness. This holiness demands reverence and worship, as only God is worthy of such honor.<p><b>All nations will come and worship before You,</b><br>This prophecy points to a future time when all peoples and nations will recognize and worship God. It echoes the vision of a united worship found in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> and <a href="/micah/4.htm">Micah 4:1-3</a>, where nations stream to the mountain of the Lord. This universal worship is also seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where the gospel is to be preached to all nations, leading to a global acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.<p><b>for Your righteous acts have been revealed.</b><br>The righteous acts of God refer to His just and faithful dealings throughout history, culminating in His redemptive work through Jesus Christ. These acts are a testament to His character and serve as a basis for worship. The revelation of God's righteousness is a theme throughout the Bible, seen in His deliverance of Israel (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>) and ultimately in the salvation offered through Christ (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>).

The word is applied here, and in <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>, to God, and denotes the recognition of those sacred obligations which the character of God, if I may say so with reverence, imposes upon Himself.

Compare the similar ascription of praise to the beast in <a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>.

It is a word which is applied more particularly to human acts. Perhaps it is used here in connection with the manifest justice of God's acts before all nations; cf. the song of Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>), "Who is like thee, glorious in holiness," etc.? The three clauses supply the reason for fearing and glorifying God, as mentioned in the first part of the verse. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> He himself is in his nature holy; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his sway extends over all nations; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the righteousness of his acts is now visible to all.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/15-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
