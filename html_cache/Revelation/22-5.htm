In biblical symbolism, night often represents sin, evil, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>). The absence of night indicates the full presence of God, where sin and evil cannot exist. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>, where God promises to be an everlasting light for His people. The city, representing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people, is free from the fear and uncertainty that night brings.<p><b>and they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sufficiency of God's presence as the source of light. In ancient times, lamps and the sun were essential for visibility and daily life. The absence of need for these traditional light sources highlights the transformative nature of God's glory, which surpasses all earthly provisions. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to be the light for His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>. The imagery also connects to the creation narrative, where God is the ultimate source of light (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>).<p><b>For the Lord God will shine on them</b><br>The shining of the Lord God on His people signifies His direct presence and favor. This recalls the Aaronic blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where God's face shining upon His people is a sign of blessing and peace. The divine light represents God's holiness, purity, and truth, illuminating the lives of the redeemed. This presence fulfills the promise of God dwelling with His people, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<p><b>and they will reign forever and ever</b><br>This phrase indicates the eternal reign of the redeemed alongside Christ. It fulfills the promise made to believers that they will share in Christ's authority and victory (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). The concept of reigning forever suggests a restoration of the dominion originally intended for humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>. This eternal reign is not just a position of authority but also a participation in the life and purposes of God, reflecting the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the New Jerusalem, the heavenly city where God's people will dwell eternally.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord God</a></b><br>The divine presence that illuminates the city, eliminating the need for any other light source.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reigning_saints.htm">The Reigning Saints</a></b><br>Believers who will reign with God forever, highlighting the eternal nature of their relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_light.htm">Eternal Light</a></b><br>The absence of night signifies the end of darkness, both physically and spiritually.
