Historically, this has been associated with the Roman Empire, which persecuted early Christians. The "was, and now is not" suggests a temporary cessation or transformation of this power, echoing the idea of a wounded beast in <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>. This reflects the cyclical nature of oppressive regimes throughout history, which rise, fall, and sometimes re-emerge in different forms.<p><b>is an eighth king</b><br>The "eighth king" implies a continuation or culmination of the previous seven kings mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. This could symbolize a future or ultimate manifestation of evil power, distinct yet connected to its predecessors. In biblical numerology, the number eight often signifies new beginnings or a new order, which in this context could mean a final, intensified form of opposition to God&#8217;s kingdom.<p><b>who belongs to the other seven</b><br>This indicates that the eighth king shares characteristics or lineage with the previous seven, suggesting a continuity of rebellion against God. The seven kings can be seen as historical or symbolic representations of earthly powers that have opposed God&#8217;s people. This connection emphasizes the persistent nature of evil throughout human history, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, where successive kingdoms oppose God&#8217;s rule.<p><b>and is going into destruction</b><br>The ultimate fate of the beast and the eighth king is destruction, affirming the biblical theme of divine justice and the eventual triumph of God over evil. This echoes the prophetic declarations found in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>, where God&#8217;s kingdom prevails over all earthly powers.

Though fresh in appearance, it is cut from the same cloth as the seven earlier God-opposing empires, and Scripture assures its certain destruction when Christ returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And the beast . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the wild beast which was, and is not, even he himself is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.</span> The wild beast himself, forming as it were an eighth, has to be reckoned with. There are seven heads; when these fall no eighth head will rise, but the wild beast, whose vitality has been seen in these successive heads, forms, as it were, an eighth, which is "out of the seven"--not one of them, but one rising out of them; no eighth empire shall rise, but the wild beast, now smitten in all the seven heads of his power, will, in the convulsive death-throe, seem an eighth power, in which the ebbing life of all the seven finds expression. The wild beast linked itself with seven great empires in succession: these all fell; the wild beast is left, as an eighth: then "the wild beast goes into destruction." As an illustration, we may recall her whom the seven brothers had as wife; last of all the woman, the eighth, which was of the seven, died also. It has been noticed that the wild beast does not "fall," like the others, "but goes into destruction;" there are no more world-powers like those who have fallen, but the wild beast is left, a last power reserved for destruction, a final antichrist, the lawless one whom the Lord will destroy with the brightness of His coming (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>). This fierce and last flickering up of the doomed power of evil is dwelt on again in <a href="/context/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,">Revelation 20:7-10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition;</span> <span class="accented">and the beast</span> (neuter, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">that was and is not, he himself is also an eighth</span> (masculine), <span class="accented">and is of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, <span class="accented">out of</span>) <span class="accented">the seven</span>, etc. We may note <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "eighth" refers to "king" in ver. 10, being masculine gender; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "eighth," shows that this is not the eighth in a successive series, in which the kings already mentioned form the first seven. The Revised Version probably gives the correct meaning, "is of the seven;" that is, the beast himself consists of, and is formed by, what has been denoted by the seven kings. We have already interpreted the beast as the worldly power - Satan in his capacity of "prince of this world." We have also shown that the "seven kings" describes this worldly power as it exists throughout all ages. This verse, therefore, sums up and reasserts briefly what has been already virtually intimated in the symbolism employed, viz. that the beast is the sum total of what has been described under the form of five kings, then one king, and then one king again (ver. 10). His final doom is also reasserted, "he goeth into perdition" (cf. ver. 8 and <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
