The number seven is significant in Scripture, symbolizing completeness or perfection, as seen in the seven days of creation. These seven angels are part of the divine order and are tasked with executing God's judgment.<p><b>with the seven trumpets</b><br>Trumpets in the Bible are often associated with significant events, such as the giving of the Law at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) and the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). They serve as instruments to announce God's intervention in human history. The use of seven trumpets here indicates a complete and divinely ordained series of judgments.<p><b>prepared to sound them</b><br>The preparation to sound the trumpets suggests an imminent action, emphasizing the urgency and seriousness of the forthcoming judgments. This preparation echoes the readiness required of believers, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).

The sounding of the trumpets introduced the series of startling events (or providences, as we sometimes call them) which serve to arrest men's attention, and remind them that there is a kingdom which cannot be shaken. Such events are landing-stages in the great advancing progress of Christ's kingdom. It may be well to remind those who are desirous of actual and limited historical fulfilments which correspond with the features of the several visions, that the aim of the visions seems to be to give the seer, and through him the Church at large, some idea of the general kind of events which ever mark the decay of the kingdom of wrong and the growth of the kingdom of our Lord. It is to this consummation the visions of the trumpets lead us. We are to see the destruction of those who destroy the earth, and the establishment of the kingdom of Him who will reign in righteousness (<a href="/context/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15-18</a>). This great consummation is to be achieved by slow and painful steps. "Wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom?" is the question answered by the seals. "How wilt thou restore the kingdom?" is the question answered by the trumpets. In both cases the answer is similar. These great results are not and cannot be attained in the quick ways human impatience would suggest. The history of the world is not to be folded up in a hurry, for that history is a development and a discipline; it is not only the consummation which is to be desired: the steps to that end are salutary, though painful. The chastisement which is not joyous but grievous may be the best means of bringing to the world the peaceable fruits of righteousness;--<p>"And man, unfriended, faltering on the way,<p>Must learn to weep before he learns to pray."<p>And this wholesome lesson of tears must be taught the world, in the slow and bitter progress of a human history marked not by one judgment but by many. The fulfilment, then, of these prophetic visions is not exhausted in one event, however nearly its features may correspond with the character of the vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span> This verse takes up and continues the narrative of ver. 2; the intervening passage serves to indicate the immediate cause of the judgments now about to descend, viz. the "prayers of the saints" (ver. 4).
