The earth, in biblical symbolism, often represents stability and order, contrasting with the chaotic sea. This beast's emergence from the earth may suggest a more subtle or deceptive nature. In the context of Revelation, beasts symbolize political or religious powers. The imagery of a beast rising indicates the emergence of a new power or influence. This beast is often interpreted as the false prophet, a figure that supports the first beast and deceives humanity. The earth's mention may also imply a connection to humanity or earthly systems, contrasting with divine or heavenly origins.<p><b>This beast had two horns like a lamb,</b><br>The two horns like a lamb suggest a deceptive appearance. In biblical symbolism, a lamb often represents innocence, purity, and Christ Himself, as seen in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> where Jesus is called the "Lamb of God." The horns, however, indicate power and authority. This beast mimics the appearance of a lamb, suggesting it may present itself as gentle or Christ-like, yet its true nature is revealed through its actions and words. The number two could symbolize a false witness or testimony, as two witnesses were required for a testimony to be considered valid in Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>but spoke like a dragon.</b><br>Despite its lamb-like appearance, the beast's speech reveals its true nature. The dragon, identified earlier in Revelation as Satan (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>), represents deceit, destruction, and opposition to God. Speaking like a dragon indicates that this beast's words are deceptive, manipulative, and aligned with satanic purposes. This contrast between appearance and speech highlights the theme of deception, warning believers to discern beyond outward appearances. The beast's speech may involve false teachings, blasphemy, or propaganda that leads people away from the truth of the Gospel. This duality emphasizes the need for spiritual discernment in recognizing false prophets and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast_from_the_earth.htm">The Beast from the Earth</a></b><br>This is the second beast mentioned in <a href="/bsb/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, distinct from the first beast that rises from the sea.

They are both wild beasts: they both have horns: they both have a dragon-like inspiration (<a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>): they both tyrannise over men; but, on the other hand, the second beast is less monstrous in appearance: we read only of two horns, and we hear nothing of seven heads. He somewhat resembles a lamb; he rises from the earth, and not from the sea; his power lies in deception (<a href="/context/revelation/13-13.htm" title="And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,">Revelation 13:13-14</a>) as well as violence; e seems to possess more supernatural power: yet the whole of his work is directed to magnifying the first beast (<a href="/revelation/13-12.htm" title="And he excercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.">Revelation 13:12</a>). Do not these features lead to the conclusion that the principles which the second wild beast supports are the same as those on which the former wild beast acted, but that he supports them with more subtlety, intelligence, and culture? But for all the deception he employs, his work, when stripped of its specious drapery and seen in its naked ugliness, is to promote the honour of the first wild beast. Because of this seductiveness, and of his efforts to support his mission with higher sanctions (<a href="/revelation/13-13.htm" title="And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,">Revelation 13:13</a>), he is called in later chapters (<a href="/revelation/16-13.htm" title="And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.">Revelation 16:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm" title="And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm" title="And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.">Revelation 20:10</a>) the False Prophet; the force and appropriateness of this designation becomes more apparent when we notice that the features which are assumed bear a deceptive resemblance to those of a lamb. The advancing intelligence of the world, its increase in knowledge and wisdom, the wider diffusion of culture and thought, produce a change in the general fashion of life, but the spirit which animates. society is unchanged. The second wild beast is that change which is a change of mode, but not of spirit--a change of manners, but not of heart; there is more refinement, more civilisation, more mind, but it is still the world-power which is worshipped; it is the self-seeking adoration of pleasures, honours, occupations, influences which spring from earth and end in earth--the pursuit of powers which are worldly. Some see in this second wild beast the Pagan priesthood aiding the imperial power, the embodiment of the first wild beast; others-see in it the Papal sacerdotal power, the heir of Pagan rites; others, again, would combine the two, and view this second wild beast as the sacerdotal persecuting power, Pagan and Christian. I believe that, though there is truth in these views, they are too narrow. It is true that priesthoods--Pagan and Christian--have often devoted their influence to the upholding of the great world-power; it is true that men called to be Christian teachers forgot their function, and used their knowledge and power to bolster up the power of the beast and to make men worship the world, as though there were nothing higher for men to worship than this world could afford; it is true that they used, in later days, their powers to aggrandize the Church rather than to reform the world and regenerate men: in so far as they did this they acted like the second wild beast; but the stretch of the vision embraces more than these. All who use their knowledge, their culture, their wisdom, to teach men that there is nothing worthy of worship save what they can see, and touch, and taste, are acting the part of the second wild beast; and be they apostles of science, or apostles of culture, or apostles of logical immorality, or apostles of what is called materialism, if their teaching leads men to limit their worship to the visible and the tangible, they are making men worship the beast who is the adversary of the servants of the Lamb. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld another beast.</span> Compare the wording of this introduction with that of ver. 1. We shall find reason to interpret this <span class="accented">beast</span> as self deceit - that form of plausibility by which men persuaded themselves into a belief that they might without harm worship the former beast. (see on following verses). It has been remarked that mention is often made of the first beast without the second (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>, etc.), but never of the second without the first. This fact supports the interpretation given above. <span class="cmt_word">Coming up out of the earth.</span> Perhaps in contrast with the former beast, which arose from the sea (ver. 1). In the vision of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. the four beasts, which rise from the sea (ver. 3), are declared in ver. 17 to typify four kings which arise from the earth. It is doubtful, therefore, whether we are justified in attaching special significance to this phrase. Some writers understand thereby, "rising up from amongst settled, ordered society of men." More likely, the writer wishes to show the universal character of the temptations with which Christians are assailed; and thus one beast seems to pertain to the sea, and the other to the earth, thus dividing the whole world between them. <span class="cmt_word">And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</span> That is, while simulating an appearance of Christ, his words betrayed his devilish nature. The aim of this beast throughout is to assume a plausible exterior, that men may be beguiled by him (cf. vers. 13-17). Such is the nature of that self deceit which we believe this beast to typify. Many men, who were not to be tempted into a renunciation of Christ by the bitter persecution of the first beast, because coming in such a form they recognized easily its true nature, were nevertheless beguiled into such acts by specious reasoning and the deceit of their own hearts. Christians at all times are only too ready to be deceived by those who "by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple" (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). Whether as in ancient times it he merely to throw a few grains of incense upon the altar of some heathen deity, or as in modern times to conform to some common but unworthy requirement of society, men are apt to be led astray by arguments which look fair, but which as surely accomplish the devil's object as if it had been attained by direct persecution.
