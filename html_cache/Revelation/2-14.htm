It suggests that despite any commendable qualities, there are significant issues that need addressing. This reflects the pattern seen in the letters to the seven churches, where commendation is often followed by correction.<p><b>because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam</b><br>Balaam was a prophet in the Old Testament who, although unable to curse Israel directly, advised King Balak of Moab on how to lead the Israelites into sin (Numbers 22-24, 31:16). This teaching represents compromise and corruption within the church, where some members are adopting practices contrary to Christian doctrine.<p><b>who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites</b><br>The "stumbling block" refers to actions or teachings that lead believers into sin. In the context of Balaam, it involved enticing the Israelites to engage in idolatry and immorality. This serves as a warning against false teachings and the dangers of leading others astray.<p><b>so they would eat food sacrificed to idols</b><br>Eating food sacrificed to idols was a contentious issue in the early church (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</a>). It symbolizes participation in pagan rituals and a compromise of Christian distinctiveness. The reference here highlights the danger of syncretism, where Christian beliefs are mixed with pagan practices.<p><b>and commit sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality was often associated with pagan worship practices in the ancient world. The inclusion of this phrase underscores the moral and spiritual corruption that can result from false teachings. It serves as a call to purity and faithfulness to God's commands, echoing the broader biblical theme of holiness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet mentioned in the Old Testament, known for his role in advising Balak on how to lead the Israelites into sin (Numbers 22-24).

Like Balaam, false teachers coax believers to blend in&#8212;first at the idol&#8217;s table, then in the idol&#8217;s bed. Jesus, who sees every heart, calls His church to unwavering loyalty: reject doctrines that excuse sin, refuse practices that blur allegiance, and pursue holiness that shines in a dark world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">But I have a few things against thee.</span>--The word "few" is not to be taken as though the ground of rebuke was a trifling one. The little leaven might leaven the whole lump; and those who had been brave unto death in the days of persecution had been less temptation-proof against more seductive influences. The church tolerated without remonstrance men holding [the word is the same as that used in commendation (<a href="/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>), "Thou holdest (fast) My name"] "the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel; (namely) to eat things sacrified to idols, and to commit fornication." Israel could not be cursed, but they might be made to bring a curse upon themselves by yielding to sin; so the counsel of Balaam was to tempt them through the women of Midian, and "Behold, these caused the children of Israel to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm" title="Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.">Numbers 31:16</a>). A similar temptation was endangering the Pergamene Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have a few things against thee</span>. They are few in comparison with the things commended; but they are very serious; and there must be a sad want of care in the Church at Pergamum to allow such things. These corrupt teachers are alluded to in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> and <a href="/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a>. Like Balaam, they debased spiritual gifts to the vilest purposes, and thus became a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a snare or stumbling block, to ethers. Like the Nicolaitans, they held that the freedom of the gospel placed them above the moral Law, and conferred licence to commit the foulest sins. The liberty to eat meats which might have been offered to idols was made a plea for liberty to take part in idolatrous rites (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; Justin Martyr, 'Trypho,' 35; Irenaeus, I. 6:3), and for introducing heathen orgies into Christian ceremonies. The doctrine of these antinomian teachers was "the doctrine of Balaam," because, like him (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:06. 6; Philo, 'Vita Mosis,' 1. p. 647), they prostituted their influence to the seducing of God's people into idolatry and impurity. The similarity of this doctrine with that of the Nicolaitans is obvious; but that Nicolaus (which is equivalent to "conquering the people") is intended as a translation of Balaam (which is <span class="accented">possibly</span> equivalent to "lord of the people") is mere conjecture. That there were two sects side by side at Pergamum is the natural meaning of this passage; and though their doctrines were alike in being autinomian in principle and licentious in result, yet there is no need to identify them.
