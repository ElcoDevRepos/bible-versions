These witnesses are often interpreted as prophetic figures sent by God during the end times. The desire to harm them indicates opposition to their divine mission, reflecting the broader theme of conflict between God's messengers and the forces of evil throughout scripture, such as the persecution of prophets in the Old Testament (e.g., Elijah and Jeremiah).<p><b>fire proceeds from their mouths</b><br>This imagery is reminiscent of the prophet Elijah, who called down fire from heaven to consume his enemies (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a>). The fire symbolizes divine judgment and authority, emphasizing the power and protection granted to the witnesses by God. It also echoes the consuming fire of God's presence seen in other biblical passages (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p><b>and devours their enemies</b><br>The devouring fire signifies the totality of God's judgment against those who oppose His will. This reflects the ultimate triumph of God's purposes over evil, a recurring theme in apocalyptic literature. The imagery of devouring fire is also found in the Psalms and the prophets, where it often represents God's righteous anger and purification.<p><b>In this way, anyone who wants to harm them must be killed</b><br>This phrase underscores the inevitability of divine justice. The protection of the witnesses is assured by God, and their enemies' destruction is portrayed as a necessary consequence of their opposition. This mirrors the principle of divine retribution found throughout the Bible, where those who oppose God's plans face ultimate judgment, as seen in the fate of Pharaoh in Exodus or the enemies of Israel in the conquest narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_witnesses.htm">The Two Witnesses</a></b><br>Central figures in <a href="/bsb/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>, these witnesses are empowered by God to prophesy during the end times.

God often equates His spoken word with fire: &#8220;I will make My words in your mouth a fire&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>).

Any attacker is instantly consumed by literal fire that issues from the witnesses&#8217; mouths, demonstrating that God&#8217;s spoken word is both life and lethal judgment. The scene echoes earlier biblical episodes where God shields His messengers and previews the final overthrow of evil when Christ returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And if any man . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And if any one wills to injure them, fire goeth forth out of their mouths, and devoureth their enemies: and if any one wills to injure them, thus must he be slain.

The fire devouring their foes seems to allude to <a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10</a>; like Elijah, they can close the heaven (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>); like Moses, they can turn water into blood and summon down every plague (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.). </span>These last characteristics remind us of the spirit and power of Moses and Elias, but we must not forget what has gone before: the witnesses are like olive trees and lights. In them is concentrated grace, light, and power; their witness recalls the great features of various Old Testament teachers and leaders; they display the light of truth, and men may not oppose or injure them with impunity; they wield a power which it is not safe to provoke. As from the mouths of the great Sixth Trumpet host there went forth fire and smoke and brimstone to kill the third part of mankind, so out of the mouths of these witnesses there goes forth a purer, but mightier flame. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm" title="There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.">Psalm 18:8</a>.) We may compare the sword out of the mouth of Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>), and the promise to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>), "Behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood, and it shall devour them." The word which is like a sword to lay bare man to himself may become a consuming fire to those who resist or oppose it. The witnesses for God are thus armed with a spiritual might; for that word which, when accepted and lived by, brings peace, when rejected causes pain and danger. Thus often do the things which might have been for men's peace become an occasion for falling; the stone which, used and built into the life, becomes a precious corner-stone and immovable foundation, grinds to powder those upon whom it falls. Thus is it with these witnesses: they come to witness for principles which go to make the world a Paradise once more. The world, which casts away their words, will find them come back with scorching force; just as the breath of God gives life and beauty to the world, and power to men's hearts and lives (<a href="/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), yet with that same breath of His lips does He slay the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>). Some have thought that there will be a time when witnesses for God will be raised up who will work literal wonders such as these. It is not for us to say that this will not be the case: all prophecy may take a sharper and clearer meaning as the times of the end draw near; but, meanwhile, it is needful for us to remember that the very power of truth is such that, when rejected, it can and does avenge itself by shutting heaven over our head, and making all the fresh rivulets of life's purest pleasures loathsome as blood to the sensualised and perverted heart. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies;</span> <span class="accented">if any one willeth to hurt them</span>, etc. Most probably a reference to the act of Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a>). Perhaps there is a double reference in the <span class="accented">fire proceeding out of their mouth</span>; it is the <span class="accented">fire</span> of their witness, which refines and purifies and convinces some; it is also the fire of condemnation, which follows those who reject the testimony. The figure is found in <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>, "I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them" (see also <a href="/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 48:1). <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed;</span> <span class="accented">any one shall will</span> (future) is read in the Revised Version, and is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 38; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, (present) is found in B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas. "In this manner;" that is, by <span class="accented">fire</span>. Such, throughout the Scriptures, is the form under which the final judgment of those who reject God's message is shadowed forth. The description is not more opposed to a general interpretation than it is to an individual interpretation of the two witnesses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7988;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
