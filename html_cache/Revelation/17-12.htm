In <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, ten horns represent ten kings that arise from a kingdom. This connection suggests a parallel between Daniel's vision and John's revelation, indicating a continuity in prophetic symbolism. The number ten can symbolize completeness or a full set, suggesting a coalition of rulers.<p><b>who have not yet received a kingdom</b><br>This phrase indicates a future event, pointing to a time when these kings will come into power. It suggests that these rulers are not yet in possession of their dominions at the time of John's writing. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Revelation, which often speaks of future events and the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>but will receive one hour of authority as kings</b><br>The "one hour" signifies a brief period of time, emphasizing the temporary nature of their reign. This brevity contrasts with the eternal kingdom of God, highlighting the transient power of earthly rulers. The phrase underscores the limited scope of their authority, which is granted for a specific purpose within God's sovereign plan.<p><b>along with the beast</b><br>The beast is a central figure in Revelation, often interpreted as a representation of a powerful, anti-Christian entity or system. The alliance of these ten kings with the beast suggests a unified opposition against God and His people. This coalition reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare and the ultimate conflict between good and evil depicted throughout Revelation. The beast's role as a central antagonist aligns with other scriptural references to end-times adversaries, such as the "man of lawlessness" in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/ten_horns.htm">Ten Horns</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of ten kings or rulers who have not yet come into power at the time of John's writing.

Here they are not vague symbols but concrete, identifiable rulers who will rise on the world stage in the last days.

They are the kings, not necessarily, as we have seen, personal kings, but rather kingdoms or nationalities, who received not a kingdom as yet; as they are on the seventh head, the hour of their power is not yet, but comes at the fall of the sixth head: then they receive power one hour. (Comp. "short time" in <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>.) But though these are sundered powers, they are one in their subjection to the wild beast. They have one mind or judgment, and their power and authority they give to the wild beast. The universal empire idea may disappear, but the spirit and principle of mere earthliness will remain; it needs no vast power like Rome to illustrate its spirit. The ten horns are united in one mind; they move as the wild beast directs; their work and tendency of their power is hostile to Christ. They shall make war with the Lamb; and the Lamb shall conquer them because He is Lord of lords, and King of kings. When do these powers make war with the Lamb? The answer is, they make war when the direction of their policy and morals is in favour of oppression, wrong, worldliness; whenever nations or peoples allow the secular spirit to breathe through all they do, they are not with Christ, they are against Him. There are hints that some "special outbreak" of hostility may take place on the eve of the full manifestation of the righteous King and His kingdom (<a href="/context/revelation/19-16.htm" title="And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.">Revelation 19:16-19</a>); busy evil spirits, lawless utterances, unbrotherly federations, unspiritual conceptions, may pave the way for such; the great crisis will then come, when the issue will be secularity and spirituality. It is not necessary to define the ten kings; the number does not need to be pressed as literal; for in Hebrew, "when a whole was to be divided into parts, ten was the number commonly adopted" (Bahr, quoted by Dr. Currey). The war of the ten kings against the Lamb is brought out more fully in Revelation 19. There the King of kings is seen victorious; in His victory they who are with Him, the <span class= "ital">called, and chosen, and faithful, </span>shall share. This threefold description is a brief summary of the Christian life. This is the only place where St. John employs the word translated "called." (Comp. <a href="/matthew/20-16.htm" title="So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.">Matthew 20:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet.</span> The <span class="accented">horns</span>, as we have seen, are symbolical of power (see on Revelation 13:1), and <span class="accented">ten</span> signifies completeness and sufficiency (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). By the <span class="accented">ten horns</span>, therefore, is expressed widespread, complete power. But this power, says the seer, has not come into existence as <span class="accented">yet.</span> He thus points to a coming power, hostile to God, such as is described in that part of the account of the seven kings which states "the other is not yet come" (ver. 10). If; seems probable, therefore, that in describing the forces opposed to God - those past, those present, and those yet to come - St. John foresees that the hostile world power will not be always pre-eminently wielded by one nation, as in his own time; but will be divided into many parts, here represented by the number <span class="accented">ten</span>, though not necessarily exactly ten in number. This, indeed, exactly describes what has really been the case since St. John's time, and what, humanly speaking, seems likely to continue to the end of the world. These <span class="accented">ten horns</span> seem thus to be identical with the seventh king of ver. 10. Compare the account given of the <span class="accented">horns</span> in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But receive power as kings one hour with the beast;</span> <span class="accented">authority</span> (Revised Version). <span class="accented">One hour</span> denotes "a short time," in which way the Bible constantly describes the period of the world's existence, and especially that period which intervenes between the time of the writer and the judgment day (cf. <a href="/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>, etc.). This sentence thus declares that, though in the future divided into many parts, and thus not being visibly as potential as former single united kingdoms, nevertheless this hostile world power will be still formidable, having ranged itself on the side of the beast, acting for and with him, and receiving power from him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast;</span> <span class="accented">they give</span> (present tense) <span class="accented">their power and authority</span>, etc. That is, though apparently split up into many sections, they form practically one, acting by and for the beast on whose side they range themselves (see on ver. 32). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
