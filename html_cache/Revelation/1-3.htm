This phrase emphasizes the importance of public proclamation and the communal aspect of worship. The blessing here is reminiscent of the beatitudes in the Gospels, indicating divine favor upon those who engage with the prophetic message. The term "prophecy" underscores the revelatory nature of the book, aligning it with Old Testament prophetic literature, which often called for repentance and faithfulness.<p><b>and blessed are those who hear and obey what is written in it</b><br>Hearing and obeying are central themes in biblical teaching, reflecting the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, which calls for attentive listening and action. This dual requirement highlights the necessity of not only receiving the message but also responding to it with obedience. The blessing extends to the community, suggesting that the message of Revelation is intended for collective edification and action. The call to obedience is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of living out one's faith (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>because the time is near</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of urgency and imminence, a common theme in apocalyptic literature. It reflects the early Christian belief in the soon return of Christ, a hope that permeated the New Testament writings (e.g., <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11-12</a>, <a href="/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a>). The nearness of the time serves as a motivation for readers and hearers to remain vigilant and faithful. This eschatological expectation is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of the Kingdom of God as both a present reality and a future hope (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>Traditionally believed to be the author of Revelation, John was exiled on the island of Patmos when he received this vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/patmos.htm">Patmos</a></b><br>A small, rocky island in the Aegean Sea where John was exiled and received the revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_churches.htm">The Seven Churches</a></b><br>The initial audience of the Book of Revelation, representing the churches in Asia Minor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophecy.htm">The Prophecy</a></b><br>Refers to the entire Book of Revelation, which contains visions and messages from Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_time_is_near.htm">The Time is Near</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the urgency and imminence of the events described in the prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_engagement_with_scripture.htm">The Blessing of Engagement with Scripture</a></b><br>Engaging with God's Word, whether by reading, hearing, or obeying, brings a special blessing.

Sometimes the history which exemplifies these principles is immediate, sometimes more remote; in other cases (as, I venture to believe, is the case with the predictions of this book) the events are both immediate and remote. The prophecy gives us the rule, with some typical application illustrative of its method of working; after-history affords us the working out of various examples. We, then, as living actors in the world, have not only to read and hear, but to keep--keep in mind and action those principles which preside over the development of all human history (<a href="/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">James 1:22</a>). The word "keep" is in itself a proof to me that the whole fulfilment of the Apocalypse could not have been exhausted in the earliest times, nor reserved to the latest times of the Church's history, but that its predictions are applicable in all eras.<p><span class= "bld">The time is at hand.</span>--In the apostolic mind this was always true, though the restless idleness of the Thessalonians was blamed (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.">2Thessalonians 3:11-12</a>). The spirit of vigilance and of ever readiness for both the providential advents and the final advent of the Christ was enjoined. (Comp. <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/james/5-9.htm" title="Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.">James 5:9</a>; <a href="/context/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8-9</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that readeth</span> this book publicly in the church, and <span class="cmt_word">they that hear</span> the book read, are equally blessed. There is grace promised to both minister and congregation who live up to the spirit of the Scriptures. St. John here suggests that a usage common in the Jewish Church (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>) may be adopted in the Christian Church. Probably this verse is the earliest authority for the public reading of the New Testament Scripture. It is very precarious to argue that "the Apocalypse, which points to this custom, cannot have been composed in the year 68," because this Christian custom is of later origin than 68. The official communications of apostles were sure to be read publicly in the churches (see Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). Until the new lectionary came into use, the blessing here promised to the liturgical use of the Apocalypse was sadly neglected in the English Church. One might almost have supposed that a blessing had been pronounced on those who do <span class="accented">not</span> read and do <span class="accented">not</span> hear the prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this prophecy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of the prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the prophecy of this book" (<a href="/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7, 18</a>). That which is a revelation in reference to Christ is a prophecy in reference to John. "Prophecy" must not be narrowed down to the vulgar meaning of <span class="accented">fore</span>telling future events; it is the <span class="accented">forth</span>telling of the mind of God. Prophecy, in the narrow sense of prediction, cannot well be <span class="accented">kept.</span> It is God's call to repentance, obedience, steadfastness, and prayer that must be kept by both reader and hearers in order to bring a blessing. And if the words are to be kept, they can be understood. We have no right to set aside the Revelation as an insoluble puzzle (comp. <a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>, where, however, we have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The time is at hand</span>. The appointed time, the season foreordained of God (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is near. We may ask, with F.D. Maurice, "Did not the original writer use words in their simple, natural sense? If he told the hearers and readers of his day that <span class="accented">the time</span> was <span class="accented">at hand</span>, did he not mean them to understand that it <span class="accented">was</span> at hand?" No doubt. But that does not preclude us from interpreting the inspired words as referring, not only to events near St. John's time, but also to other events of which they were the foretastes and figures. To us the meaning is that the type of the end has been foretold and has come, and the end itself, which has been equally foretold, must be watched for in all seriousness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Blessed [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Makarios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3107.htm">Strong's 3107: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happy, blessed, to be envied.
