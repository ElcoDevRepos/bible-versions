The wilderness is a place of refuge and testing, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey through the desert after the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16:1-3</a>). It symbolizes a place of divine protection and provision, away from the immediate threat of the dragon, which represents Satan. The wilderness is also a recurring theme in Scripture as a place where God meets His people and provides for them, as seen in the experiences of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4-8</a>) and John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-3</a>).<p><b>where God had prepared a place for her</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and providence. Just as God prepared a place for the Israelites in the Promised Land, He has prepared a place of safety for the woman. This preparation indicates divine foreknowledge and care, ensuring that His people are protected during times of trial. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a refuge and fortress (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>to be nourished</b><br>Nourishment here implies both physical sustenance and spiritual support. In the wilderness, God provided manna for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31-35</a>), and similarly, He provides for the woman's needs. This nourishment can also be seen as spiritual, as God sustains His people through His Word and presence, echoing Jesus' teaching that man does not live on bread alone but on every word from God (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p><b>for 1,260 days</b><br>The 1,260 days, equivalent to 42 months or 3.5 years, is a significant prophetic period found in apocalyptic literature. It corresponds to the "time, times, and half a time" mentioned in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>. This period is often associated with the Great Tribulation, a time of intense persecution and trial for God's people. It signifies a limited, divinely appointed time of suffering, after which deliverance will come. This timeframe is also linked to the ministry of the two witnesses in <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>, highlighting a period of testimony and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's people, often interpreted as Israel or the Church.

The verse assures believers that every detail of prophecy unfolds under God&#8217;s sovereign care, highlighting His faithfulness to preserve His covenant people and fulfill His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And the woman fled . </span>. .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath there a place prepared from God, that there they may nourish her for a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> The flight of the woman into the wilderness, and her fortunes there, are more fully described in <a href="/revelation/12-13.htm" title="And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.">Revelation 12:13</a>. This verse simply tells us that the woman fled; we read afterwards that it was persecution which drove her into the wilderness. As long as the evil one can be called the prince of this world: as long, that is, as the world refuses to recognise her true Prince, and pays homage to worldliness, and baseness, and falseness in heart, mind, or life, so long must the Church, in so far as she is faithful to Him who is true, dwell as an exile in the wilderness. This feeling it was--not any hostility to life as life, or to life's duties--which led the Apostle to speak of Christians as strangers and pilgrims, and of the Church as another Israel, whom a greater than Moses or Joshua was conducting to a land of better promise (<a href="/context/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8-9</a>). The woman, the representative of the Church, has a place prepared by God for her in the wilderness; she is not altogether uncared for; she has a place prepared, and nourishment. God provides her with a tabernacle of safety (<a href="/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>), and with the true Bread "which came down from heaven" (<a href="/exodus/16-15.htm" title="And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.">Exodus 16:15</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/78-24.htm" title="And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.">Psalm 78:24-25</a>; <a href="/context/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.">John 6:49-50</a>), and with the living water from the Rock (<a href="/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>; <a href="/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-39</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;">1Corinthians 10:3-4</a>). The time of the sojourn in the wilderness is twelve hundred and sixty days, a period corresponding in length to the forty-two months during which the witnesses prophesied; it is the period of the Church's witness against predominant evil. Driven forth, her voice, though but as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, is lifted up on behalf of righteousness and truth. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the woman fled into the wilderness.</span> As with Christ, so with his Church. His great trial took place in the wilderness; so the trial of the Church occurs in the wilderness, by which figure the world is typified. It is generally pointed out that this verse is here inserted in anticipation of ver. 14. We prefer rather to look upon it as occurring in its natural place, the narrative being interrupted by vers. 7-13 in order to account for the implacable hostility of the devil. <span class="cmt_word">Where she hath a place prepared of God</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, and others insert <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "where she there hath," etc. - a redundancy which is an ordinary Hebraism. Though the Church is "in the world," she is not "of the world" (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14, 15</a>); though the woman is in the "wilderness," her place is "prepared of God." The harlot's abode (<a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>.) is in the wilderness, and it is also of the wilderness; it is not in a place specially prepared of God. <span class="cmt_word">That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.</span> The sense is the same as in ver. 14, "that she should be sustained there." The interpretation of the 1260 days, or 3.5 years, coincides here with that adopted in <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. It describes the period of this world's existence, during the whole of which the devil persecutes the Church of God. As Auberlen points out, this is, in <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, declared to be "the period of the power of the beast, that is, the world power." (For a discussion of the whole subject of this period, see on Revelation 11:2.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
