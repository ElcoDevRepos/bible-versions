The imagery of lampstands is reminiscent of the menorah in the Tabernacle and Temple, symbolizing the presence of God and the light of His truth. The placement among the lampstands indicates Christ's presence and authority within the churches, emphasizing His role as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>was One like the Son of Man</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic reference from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a divine figure given authority and an everlasting kingdom. Jesus frequently used this title for Himself, highlighting both His humanity and divinity. This phrase underscores His role as the prophesied Messiah and Judge, who has authority over the churches and the world.<p><b>dressed in a long robe</b><br>The long robe signifies dignity and authority, often associated with priests and kings in biblical times. This attire reflects Christ's role as our High Priest, who intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The robe also symbolizes righteousness and purity, qualities inherent in Christ's nature.<p><b>with a golden sash around His chest</b><br>The golden sash is a symbol of royalty and priesthood. In the Old Testament, the high priest wore a sash as part of his sacred garments (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>). The placement around the chest, rather than the waist, suggests a position of readiness and authority. Gold, being a precious metal, signifies the value and purity of Christ's priestly and kingly office.

He was present the same as He had been known on earth, yet different--the same, for He is seen as Son of Man; the same as He had been seen on the Resurrection evening; the same as He appeared to Stephen; the same Jesus, caring for, helping and counselling His people: yet different, for He is arrayed in the apparel of kingly and priestly dignity. He is robed to the foot with the long garment of the high priest. St. John uses the same word which is used in the LXX. version of <a href="/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31</a>, to describe the robe of the Ephod. (Comp. <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.">Zechariah 3:4</a>.) It has been understood by some, however, to indicate the "ample robe of judicial and kingly power." There is in the vision a combination of both thoughts. He is the King-Priest who is seen by the Evangelist, the Melchisedec whom the Epistle to the Hebrews had so gloriously set forth (<a href="/context/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9-10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; especially <a href="/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-17</a>). He is girt about the breasts with a golden girdle. The girdle is not around the loins, as though ready for action and toil (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>), but it is worn as by one who rests from toil in the "repose of sovereignty." So, according to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> iii. 7, ? 2), the Levitical priests were girdled. The girdle is of gold; not interwoven with gold, as was the high priest's girdle (<a href="/exodus/28-8.htm" title="And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.">Exodus 28:8</a>), but pure gold, the emblem of a royal presence. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm" title="Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;">Ephesians 6:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the candlesticks</span>.

The angel in <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5, 6</a> is described in similar language: "whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a>, "I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand"). "Enough is said to indicate that the Son of man claims and fulfils the office which was assigned to the children of Aaron; that he blesses the people in God's Name; that he stands as their Representative before his Father" (F.D. Maurice). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">among</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#963;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(mes&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3319.htm">Strong's 3319: </a> </span><span class="str2">Middle, in the middle, between, in the midst of.
