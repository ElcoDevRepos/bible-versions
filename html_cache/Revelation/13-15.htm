The "breath" given to the image signifies a counterfeit form of life, reminiscent of God's breath of life in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>. This act of animating the image is a deceptive miracle, echoing the false signs and wonders warned about in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>. The image of the first beast represents idolatry and blasphemy, drawing parallels to the golden image in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, which demanded worship under threat of death.<p><b>so that the image could speak</b><br>The speaking image is a further deception, designed to mimic divine communication. In biblical times, idols were mute and powerless (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-7</a>), but this image's ability to speak is a perversion of true prophecy and divine revelation. This act is a direct challenge to the authority of God, as it seeks to establish the beast's image as an object of worship, similar to the way God spoke through His prophets.<p><b>and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed</b><br>This phrase highlights the coercive power and persecution faced by those who remain faithful to God. The demand for worship under penalty of death mirrors the trials faced by early Christians under Roman rule, where emperor worship was enforced. It also reflects the trials of Daniel's companions in Babylon, who refused to bow to Nebuchadnezzar's image (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16-18</a>).

Wisdom can give a semblance of life to the most doomed cause; and the bulk of mankind read only with their eyes, and not at all with their thoughts. The image of the Roman emperor was, in ancient days, made an object of worship. Christians suffered rather than by such an act of worship prove disloyal to Christ: like their spiritual ancestors, they refused to worship the image which the world-power had set up; they were willing to render to Caesar the things that were Caesar's, but the homage which belonged to God they refused to any but their God. These are but types of those who have refused, though tempted by specious eloquence and sagacious subtlety, to offer homage to any mere world-power; for the golden image is ever set up upon the plains of this world: its glitter and its vitality survive the storm and the conflict of the ages: it speaks, and men hear and adore, for they walk by sight, not by faith; and it needs no imperial or papal edict to doom to social death and failure those who refuse to shape their conduct by considerations of self-interest, and who are sure to be treated as fanatics because they follow right and conscience and Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given to him to give breath</span>, etc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and a number of cursives lead the indicative future, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, that is," he [the beast] shall cause," etc. The symbolism is most probably derived from the heathen oracles. This beast is permitted <span class="accented">to give life</span>, to impart spirit to the <span class="accented">image</span>; that is, he gives it an appearance of reality which a mere image could not possess. This is the dangerous power of self deceit. If men would face the naked truth, stripped of plausible arguments and specious resemblances, they would see that there was no reality in the ideal which they place before their minds, and their worship of which is prompted by love of the world, and the denial of God's power. Together with the attempt to deceive men into worshipping the image, is offered the alternative of death, or, should we not say, apparent death? It is only self deceit which makes men imagine that the alternative to an acceptance of the sovereignty of Satan and the world; is death. No doubt many Christians in St. John's time were thus beguiled. They deceived themselves by imagining that they must either conform to the heathen practices required of them, or suffer death; those with clearer mental vision saw that the threatened death was in reality life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The second beast] was permitted</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#948;&#972;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(edoth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
