The name "Wormwood" refers to a bitter plant known for its toxic properties, often used metaphorically in Scripture to signify judgment or calamity (<a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>). The star's name suggests a divine instrument of judgment, aligning with the apocalyptic themes of Revelation.<p><b>A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil,</b><br>The fraction "a third" is significant in Revelation, indicating a partial but substantial impact, reflecting God's measured judgment. The transformation of waters into bitterness echoes the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>) and serves as a warning of spiritual and physical corruption. Wormwood oil, known for its bitterness, symbolizes the severity of the judgment, affecting essential resources.<p><b>and many people died from the bitter waters.</b><br>The consequence of the waters turning bitter is death, highlighting the seriousness of divine judgment. This mirrors Old Testament warnings where disobedience leads to physical and spiritual death (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of repentance and the dire consequences of ignoring God's warnings, as seen throughout prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wormwood.htm">Wormwood</a></b><br>A star that falls from heaven, turning a third of the waters bitter. The term "wormwood" is derived from the Greek word "apsinthos," which refers to a bitter plant known for its toxic properties. In biblical symbolism, wormwood often represents bitterness, sorrow, and divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/waters.htm">Waters</a></b><br>The waters affected by the star Wormwood symbolize the life-sustaining resources of the earth.

This star is an actual object sent by God, much like the literal hail, fire, and burning mountain of the previous trumpet judgments (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming the star signals its purpose. Throughout Scripture wormwood pictures severe divine judgment that produces bitterness and sorrow (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; 23:15; <a href="/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The star &#8220;fell from heaven&#8221; just as other celestial messengers are seen under God&#8217;s command (<a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>). Whether a meteor or an angelic being, it fulfills His precise plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil</b><p>&#8226; The scope is exact: one-third of the freshwater sources&#8212;rivers, springs, and wells&#8212;become tainted. This mirrors the pattern of partial judgments in the trumpets, leaving opportunity for repentance before full wrath falls (compare <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7-12</a>).<p>&#8226; As in Egypt when the Nile turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>), God shows supremacy over what sustains life. Yet here the water becomes &#8220;bitter like wormwood oil,&#8221; an unmistakable sign of poisonous contamination (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The judgment is physical and literal. Earth&#8217;s ecosystem will be altered in a moment, demonstrating that the Creator, not humanity, has final authority over creation (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Many people died from the bitter waters</b><p>&#8226; The result is widespread death: those who drink the polluted water perish. The tragedy parallels earlier plagues that brought literal fatalities (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying &#8220;many,&#8221; Revelation underscores escalating severity as the Tribulation unfolds. Later trumpets and bowls intensify the toll (<a href="/revelation/9-15.htm">Revelation 9:15</a>; 16:4-6).<p>&#8226; Such loss of life reveals the high cost of unrepentant sin. <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a> soberly reminds, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a> describes a future trumpet judgment in which a divinely sent star called Wormwood strikes Earth&#8217;s freshwater, turning one-third of it lethally bitter. The name links the event to Old Testament images of judgment, the bitterness signals divine wrath, and the resulting deaths demonstrate both God&#8217;s holiness and the urgency of repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And the name of the star </span>. . .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many of mankind died from the waters, because they were embittered</span>. The bitter, nauseous plant known as wormwood (apsinthos) is used to represent troubles and calamities. In <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.">Jeremiah 9:15</a> we have an example of this: "Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink." It is worth noticing that the Israelites are warned against idolatry as "a root that beareth gall and wormwood" (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); and we may recall the symbolical act of Moses, who ground the golden calf to powder, cast the powder in the brook, and made the children of Israel drink (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm" title="And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.">Exodus 32:20</a>). Some have thought that this falling star signified some false teacher, whose evil influence poisoned the pure currents of the gospel, and perverted the minds of men of original genius, who are represented here as fountains. The passages cited above favour the thought, and it may be included in the general meaning of the vision; but the main point seems to be to give us hints of those stages which will mark the advance of Christianity. The fall of the great men, the rulers and leaders, will take place, and their fall will bring misery to mankind. Doubtless the appearance of false teachers in the Church is one of the evidences find an unavoidable accompaniment of a progressing faith (<a href="/matthew/13-26.htm" title="But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.">Matthew 13:26</a>). But all such false lights shall fall before Him who is the true Light and Morning Star, and who will heal all embittered waters of life. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/15-23.htm" title="And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.">Exodus 15:23</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/2-19.htm" title="And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.">2Kings 2:19</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the star is called Wormwood.</span> The plant known to us under the name of <span class="accented">wormwood</span> is doubtless identical with the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this passage. The present English word is a corruption of <span class="accented">wer-mod</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">ware-mood</span>), which may be rendered "mind-preserver," a name given to the plant by the Saxons, on account of its fancied virtues; for it was believed to be a protection against madness. Such properties were formerly frequently ascribed to plants possessing bitter and nauseous tastes, such as that of the wormwood. Varieties of the plant are common in Palestine, and are widely distributed in the world. Among the ancients it was typical of bitter sorrow. Thus <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>, "Remembering my misery, the wormwood and the gall;" <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, "I will feed them with wormwood." Here, therefore, the name indicates the effect of the star, viz. to cause intense trouble and sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of the waters became wormwood;</span> that is, became bitter as wormwood, that is, charged with sorrow and disaster. The general effect of the incident is described in the name given to the chief actor, as in the case of the fourth seal (see <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter;</span> <span class="accented">many of the men.</span> Possibly (though not necessarily) of the men dwelling near the waters. For the first time mention is made of the death of <span class="accented">men</span>, though, doubtless, it is implied in the preceding judgments. We may notice the contrast in the miracles of Moses, who sweetened the waters of Marah (<a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.), and of Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
