The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, indicating the fullness of God's judgment. The angel's role as a messenger highlights the divine origin of the revelation given to John. This connection to the previous chapter emphasizes the ongoing narrative of judgment and the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>Come, I will show you</b><br>The invitation to "come" signifies a transition to a new vision or revelation. It is a call for John to witness and understand the deeper spiritual realities being unveiled. This phrase echoes similar invitations in prophetic literature, where prophets are often called to see visions that reveal God's purposes (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>). The act of showing indicates that what follows is a revelation that requires divine insight to comprehend.<p><b>the punishment of the great prostitute</b><br>The "great prostitute" is a symbolic figure representing a corrupt and idolatrous system, often interpreted as a city or empire that leads people away from God. In the context of Revelation, this figure is commonly associated with Babylon, a symbol of human pride and opposition to God. The term "prostitute" is used metaphorically in the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>). The punishment signifies God's righteous judgment against such unfaithfulness and corruption.<p><b>who sits on many waters</b><br>The imagery of "sitting on many waters" suggests dominion and influence over a vast area or multitude of peoples. In ancient times, cities like Babylon were situated by rivers, which were sources of life and commerce, symbolizing power and wealth. The phrase "many waters" is later explained in <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> as representing peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages, indicating the widespread influence and control of the entity symbolized by the great prostitute. This imagery connects to the Old Testament, where waters often symbolize chaos and nations (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_angels.htm">The Seven Angels</a></b><br>These are the angels who hold the seven bowls of God's wrath, as described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>.

Against Babylon the voices of the prophets were lifted up (<a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm" title="And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.">Jeremiah 51:25</a>); she seemed to them the embodiment of splendid vice and resistless power; "the glory of kingdoms," "the golden city," "who exalted her throne above the stars of God," "who sat as a lady given to pleasures, and flattering herself that she would see no sorrow." In her greatness and her hostility to Jerusalem she became a type of later world-powers; and, in St. John's vision, Babylon, in her purple and her pomp, in her luxurious ness and her tyranny, takes her place. And it is explained in the vision that Babylon is no longer the literal Babylon, but the power which has taken her place of pride and empire. That power was Rome. Rome was in St. John's day just what Babylon had been in the days of the prophets--"the hammer of the whole earth," the "golden cup that made all the earth drunken" (<a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a> of this chapter). At the same time, the way in which the Evangelist transfers to the Rome of his day the prophetic language which earlier prophets applied to ancient Babylon (compare these chapters, Revelation 17, 18, with Isaiah 47, <a href="/context/jeremiah/51-6.htm" title="Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.">Jeremiah 51:6-14</a>) ought to be sufficient to warn us against limited and local interpretations, even if the seven-headed wild beast did not show us that the world-power, like the moral principles of which Babylon and Rome were examples, is not confined to one age. If we remember this, we shall see that the Babylon of the Apocalypse, while, undoubtedly, Pagan Rome, cannot be limited to it. Is it, then, the question must be asked, Papal Rome? The answer is: In so far as Papal Rome has wielded tyrant power, turned persecutor, stood between the spirits of men and Christ, depraved men's consciences, withheld the truth, connived at viciousness, sought aggrandisement, and been a political engine rather than a witness for the righteous King, she has inherited the features of Babylon. The recognition of these features led Dante to apply this very passage in the Apocalypse to Rome under the rule of worldly and tyrant popes, when he exclaimed to the shade of Nicholas III. (<span class= "ital">Il compiuto</span>)<span class= "ital">:</span>-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me;</span> <span class="accented">and spake with me, saying.</span> Omit "unto me." This and the following chapters (to <a href="/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>) consist of visions which are really included under the seventh vial, but which, on account of their length and elaboration, may be considered apart from the other judgments of that vial. In the preceding chapters we have had placed before us a conspectus of three classes of ungodly people, and the three principles of evil in their abstract form, as represented by the world (the first beast), the flesh (the second beast), and the devil (the dragon). The personal final overthrow of the devil is described in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. and 18, are devoted to the description of the judgments of the two former - the world, in its character of the openly hostile persecutor of the Church of God; and the other portion of the ungodly who, while still professing Christianity, find excuses for conforming to the worship of the image of the beast. The first beast is, therefore, identical with Babylon, and represents, as we have seen, the openly hostile and persecuting world power of all ages, of which, in St. John's time, Rome was the foremost embodiment. The second beast is identical with the harlot, and represents faithless Christians, the apostate portion of the Church. The very <span class="accented">raison d'etre</span> of the Apocalypse is to deal with these two forms of evil; to declare the overthrow of the one, and to warn and, if possible, reclaim those under the influence of the other. In the latter case, the warning consists in setting forth the judgment in store for faithless Christians; and as this is the course pursued with the former also, the two merge into one, and indeed are declared to be one. The apostle in substance declares that, though there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> difference between the two forms of ungodliness, there is in reality no distinction to be made, but both are involved in one common final judgment. He thus twice solemnly asserts that the harlot is Babylon (vers. 5 and 18). The comments upon the following chapters will be based upon this hypothesis, the reasons for which will be brought out more clearly as we proceed. The opening words of this chapter leave no doubt that the visions which follow are connected with the vial judgments. The "one of the seven angels" may be the seventh angel, to whom it pertained to unfold the circumstances connected with the last judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment.</span> <span class="accented">Hither</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>, without the verb, as in <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> and <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. Though this particular narration necessarily takes place after the account of the vials, yet we are not to understand that the events here related are subsequent to these related in the concluding verses of the previous chapter. Note the remarkable similarity between these words and these of <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, and the contrast between the bride, the wife of the Lamb, and the harlot who is connected with the beast. Wordsworth carries the comparison even to the form of words, thus - <p>The harlot and the beast.<br /><span class="greek">&#x397;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x397;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span><br />The bride and the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">Of the great whore;</span> <span class="accented">harlot</span> (Revised Version).
