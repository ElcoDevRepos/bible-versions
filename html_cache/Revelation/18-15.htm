In biblical context, Babylon often represents a center of commerce and idolatry, drawing parallels to the historical city known for its wealth and decadence (<a href="/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>). The merchants' wealth is tied to their participation in this corrupt system, highlighting the moral compromise involved in their prosperity. This echoes the warnings in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a> about the love of money being a root of all kinds of evil.<p><b>will stand at a distance, in fear of her torment</b><br>The image of standing at a distance suggests both physical separation and a desire to avoid sharing in Babylon's judgment. This reflects the fear and helplessness of those who witness the downfall of a once-great power. The torment mentioned here is indicative of divine judgment, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20-21</a>) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>). The fear of torment underscores the inevitability and severity of God's judgment on sin.<p><b>They will weep and mourn</b><br>The emotional response of weeping and mourning signifies deep regret and loss, not necessarily repentance. This reaction is similar to the lamentations over Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/27-31.htm">Ezekiel 27:31-32</a>, where merchants mourn the loss of a trading partner.
