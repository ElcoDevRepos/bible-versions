"King of the nations" highlights God's authority over all peoples, fulfilling prophecies of His dominion (<a href="/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>).

By linking Moses and the Lamb, the verse bridges Exodus deliverance with end-time redemption, showing one continuous story of salvation. The song exalts God&#8217;s power, celebrates His flawless justice, and proclaims His universal kingship. For believers, it reassures that every act of God&#8212;past, present, and future&#8212;is great, wonderful, just, and true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.</span>--They join their voices to the music of their harps. The song of Moses was a paean of victory over Pharaoh and his hosts (<a href="/context/exodus/14-26.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.">Exodus 14:26-31</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1-21</a>). Israel stood on the margin of the Red Sea and saw the tokens of the overthrow of the great world-power of that day; so these saints stand by the border of the fire-blent sea of glass, and sing the song of triumph over the doom of the great world-powers of every age. The cases are parallel, the songs are alike; and it would not be out of place were the words of that other song of Moses, the man of God, to be heard from those who are made glad according to the days of their affliction, and who are clothed with the beauty of the Lord their God (<a href="/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-15.htm" title="Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.">Psalm 90:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm" title="And let the beauty of the LORD our God be on us: and establish you the work of our hands on us; yes, the work of our hands establish you it.">Psalm 90:17</a>). They also sing the song of the Lamb. The Apocalypse is full of Christ; the Lamb is the axis on which the world of its scenery moves; He is the key of earth's history; the victory of the saints is in Him (<a href="/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>); their song of triumph is of Him who put a new song in their mouth and in whom all things are reconciled (<a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.</span> Most probably the song of deliverance after the passage of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.), to which this bears a general resemblance. Moses is called the "servant of God" in <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> and elsewhere. The song of Moses is also the song of the Lamb; the Old Testament and the New Testament Churches are one. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>, "And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them;" also <a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>).
