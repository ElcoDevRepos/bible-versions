The imagery of an angel pouring out a bowl suggests a deliberate and complete action, symbolizing the fullness of divine judgment. The sea often represents the nations or the chaotic forces opposed to God, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. The act of pouring into the sea signifies a direct impact on the world's systems and economies, which are often symbolized by the sea in biblical literature.<p><b>and it turned to blood like that of the dead</b><br>This transformation of the sea into blood echoes the first plague in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>), where the Nile turned to blood. The comparison to "blood like that of the dead" suggests a thick, coagulated state, emphasizing the severity and unnaturalness of the judgment. Blood in biblical terms often symbolizes life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), but here it represents death and corruption, indicating a complete reversal of the natural order and a sign of divine wrath.<p><b>and every living thing in the sea died</b><br>The death of every living thing in the sea underscores the totality of this judgment. This phrase highlights the catastrophic impact on marine life, which would have been a significant source of sustenance and commerce in the ancient world. The complete destruction of sea life can be seen as a reversal of the creation order in Genesis, where God filled the waters with living creatures (<a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-21</a>). This judgment serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, aligning with prophetic warnings found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>, where God speaks of sweeping away fish of the sea in His judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_angel.htm">Second Angel</a></b><br>One of the seven angels tasked with pouring out the bowls of God's wrath upon the earth.

He is neither reacting impulsively nor losing track (see <a href="/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1, 7</a>).<p>&#8226; The angelic minister reminds us that God often works through intermediaries; yet the action remains God&#8217;s: &#8220;the wrath of God is finished&#8221; (15:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Poured out his bowl</b><p>The verb pictures a deliberate, comprehensive emptying. Nothing is held back; all the contents hit their mark.<p>&#8226; The bowls echo the censers of <a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8</a>, tying God&#8217;s final judgments to the prayers of the saints.<p>&#8226; Unlike the earlier trumpets that strike only &#8220;a third&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8-9</a>), the bowls are total. The restraint has ended; mercy has been repeatedly spurned (cf. <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the bowls come from the heavenly sanctuary (15:6-7), the judgment is holy, not haphazard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into the sea</b><p>The target is the world&#8217;s oceans&#8212;the literal sea that covers most of the planet.<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays the sea as both life-giving and chaotic. Here it becomes a stage for God&#8217;s verdict (<a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The second trumpet hit only &#8220;a third of the sea&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8</a>), but the bowl covers every drop. The escalation warns that dismissing earlier alarms invites fuller calamity.<p>&#8226; Commerce, food supply, climate&#8212;human life relies heavily on the oceans. When they are struck, the entire global system reels (<a href="/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And it turned to blood like that of the dead</b><p>The water becomes &#8220;blood like that of the dead&#8221;&#8212;thick, dark, coagulated, repulsive.<p>&#8226; This plague mirrors the first Egyptian plague (<a href="/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17-21</a>). God&#8217;s past judgments guarantee His future ones; He is consistent.<p>&#8226; Blood symbolizes both life lost and penalty paid (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The sea, once teeming with life, now broadcasts death, testifying that rebellion against the Creator brings forfeiture of life.<p>&#8226; The description &#8220;like that of the dead&#8221; removes any thought of mere discoloration. It is unmistakably fatal, an irrefutable sign that God&#8217;s wrath is not symbolic but literal (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every living thing in the sea died</b><p>No exceptions remain: &#8220;every living thing&#8221; perishes.<p>&#8226; The trumpet judgment killed a third of sea life (<a href="/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a>); the bowl finishes the task. God&#8217;s warnings have progressed to completion.<p>&#8226; This is a reversal of <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-22</a>, where God filled the seas with life. Judgment dismantles what sin has corrupted, setting the stage for the new creation where &#8220;there will be no more sea&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>)&#8212;possibly signifying the removal of all that once threatened or separated humanity from God.<p>&#8226; For a world that idolizes material security, the collapse of the marine ecosystem is a blow to pride and self-sufficiency (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a> records a literal, global plague unleashed by the second bowl of God&#8217;s wrath. An angel, acting under divine authority, pours the bowl into the sea, turning it into thick, death-laden blood. Every marine creature dies, demonstrating the totality of God&#8217;s judgment against persistent rebellion. The event escalates earlier warnings, mirrors the Exodus plagues, overturns the created order, and paves the way for the purified new heavens and new earth where righteousness dwells.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And thesecond angel . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the second </span>(<span class= "ital">angel</span>)<span class= "ital"> poured out his vial on the sea, and it becameblood as of a dead man, and every soul of life died </span>(<span class= "ital">even</span>)<span class= "ital"> the things that were in the sea.</span> The reference to the first of the Egyptian plagues is clear (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a>; comp. <a href="/context/revelation/8-8.htm" title="And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;">Revelation 8:8-9</a>). It has been remarked that "the Egyptian plagues stood in a very close connection with the natural state and circumstances of Egypt. The Nile, which was their strength, became worse than useless when its waters were turned to blood." There is a similar feature here. The sea, out of which the wild beast rose, from which the world-power drew strength, is turned to blood, the blood as of a dead man, corrupt and loathsome. The sea represented the tumultuous impulses and passions of the masses; there is a certain healthy force in these, but under certain conditions, when devoted to selfishness and earthliness, they become corrupt and deadly. Ruled by God and by right, the voice of multitudes is melodious as the voice of the sea, and the free movement of peoples, like the ocean, a health-giving moral environment to nations; but swayed by impulse, or directed by worldliness, they become an element of corruption, killing every token of better life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea.</span> Omit "angel," which is not found in the best manuscripts, though it is understood.
