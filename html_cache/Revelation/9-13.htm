These judgments are a sequence of events that unfold during the end times, each bringing about significant calamities. The number six often symbolizes imperfection or incompleteness in biblical numerology, contrasting with the number seven, which signifies completion or perfection. The sixth trumpet follows the fifth, which unleashed a plague of demonic locusts, and precedes the seventh, which heralds the final series of judgments known as the seven bowls.<p><b>and I heard a voice</b><br>The voice John hears is not specified, but it is authoritative and commands the release of the four angels bound at the Euphrates River. In biblical literature, a voice from heaven often signifies divine instruction or revelation. This voice could be interpreted as coming from God, an angel, or another heavenly being, emphasizing the divine orchestration of the events that follow.<p><b>from the four horns of the golden altar</b><br>The golden altar refers to the altar of incense located in the Holy Place of the tabernacle and later the temple. The four horns on the altar were projections at each corner, symbolizing strength and power. In the Old Testament, the altar of incense was associated with the prayers of the people (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>). In Revelation, the altar is depicted as being before God, indicating its heavenly counterpart. The mention of the altar connects the events of the sixth trumpet to the prayers of the saints, suggesting that the judgments are, in part, a response to these prayers.<p><b>before God</b><br>The phrase "before God" emphasizes the divine presence and authority over the unfolding events. It indicates that the altar, and the voice emanating from it, are situated in the heavenly realm, underscoring the sovereignty of God in the execution of judgment. This setting also highlights the holiness and justice of God, as the judgments are carried out in His presence, aligning with His divine will and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sixth_angel.htm">Sixth Angel</a></b><br>One of the seven angels given trumpets to sound, each heralding a specific judgment or event during the end times.

From here, in full view of God&#8217;s throne, judgment is authorized.
