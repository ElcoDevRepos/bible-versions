The imagery of horses is significant in biblical prophecy, often symbolizing swift action and divine intervention. The horse going forth indicates the initiation of a new phase in the unfolding of end-time events, as seen in the sequence of seals being opened in Revelation.<p><b>It was bright red,</b><br>The color red is symbolic of bloodshed and war. In biblical symbolism, red often represents violence and conflict, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2-3</a>, where red is associated with the garments of one who treads the winepress of wrath. The bright red color of the horse suggests the intensity and widespread nature of the conflict it brings.<p><b>and its rider was granted permission to take away peace from the earth</b><br>The rider's authority to remove peace indicates a divinely permitted disruption of global harmony. This aligns with the biblical theme that God allows certain events to unfold as part of His sovereign plan. The removal of peace can be connected to Jesus' warnings in <a href="/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6-7</a> about wars and rumors of wars as signs of the end times.<p><b>and to make men slay one another.</b><br>This phrase highlights the internal strife and conflict among humanity, suggesting civil unrest and widespread violence. It reflects the consequences of sin and the breakdown of societal order, reminiscent of the chaos described in <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>, where the earth was filled with violence before the flood.<p><b>And he was given a great sword.</b><br>The great sword symbolizes significant power and authority to execute judgment and warfare. In biblical terms, a sword often represents divine judgment or the execution of God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-10</a>. The granting of a great sword to the rider underscores the severity and scale of the conflict that will ensue.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_horse.htm">The Red Horse</a></b><br>Symbolizes war and bloodshed.

Together these details demonstrate God&#8217;s righteous judgment on a world that rejects His Son, while assuring believers that every event unfolds under His sovereign hand and moves history toward Christ&#8217;s ultimate triumph.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there went out another horse that was red.</span> There is a very general agreement that the red horse signifies <span class="accented">war</span> - slaughter by the sword which was given to "him that sat thereon." Slight variations of the application occur. Wordsworth, following the more ancient expositors, thinks that only that aspect of war is intended which consists in the persecution of the saints; while Alford and others would not restrict the meaning, but consider that war in general is meant, relying upon the following words, "that they should kill one another," and quoting our Lord's prophecy, "I came not to send peace, but a sword" (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). Both views may be correct. Though there had never been persecution, war would be one of the great afflictions from which Christians in various ages suffer, and in which they need consolation; but we may well believe that St. John, in writing to Christians who were themselves being grievously persecuted, should refer especially to the slaughter of the saints, as one of the trials inflicted upon them with God's knowledge and permission. The Revelation, intended as a support to those to whom St. John wrote, and applying directly and specially to their situation, has vet a wider application, and foreshadows the fate of each individual Christian and the Church in general throughout all ages.

"Power" (cf. <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>). A few authorities omit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, "out." "The earth" has been erroneously restricted to the Roman empire or to Judaea. The whole world is meant. Here is a repetition of our Lord's prophecy, "I came not to send peace, but a sword" (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). The sword directed against the saints of God is, by God's providence, converted into an instrument for the refining and conversion of his kingdom. As in the death of Christ, Satan was foiled with his own weapon, and by death came life, so what is intended by the enemies of God to be the extermination of Christianity is the means of increasing and strengthening his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And that they should kill one another;</span> that is, that among the inhabitants of the earth some should kill others. As explained above, this includes both the slaughter of the saints and war in general. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to sacrifice," is peculiar to St. John, being found only in the Revelation and in <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>. The use of this verb seems to imply that the vision more immediately contemplates the death of the martyrs. <span class="cmt_word">And there was given unto him a great sword.</span> Here, again, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, though used also in a wider sense, signifies strictly the sacrificial knife, the natural instrument of the slaughter mentioned. It is the LXX. word used in <a href="/genesis/22-6.htm">Genesis 22:6, 10</a>, in the account of the sacrifice of Isaac, where it is also closely connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to sacrifice," the verb used in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">another</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(allos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_243.htm">Strong's 243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Other, another (of more than two), different.
