In the context of the church in Sardis, it suggests a state of spiritual lethargy or complacency. The call to "wake up" is reminiscent of other biblical exhortations to be watchful, such as in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where Jesus warns His disciples to stay awake because they do not know the hour of His return. The urgency of this command indicates the seriousness of their spiritual condition.<p><b>and strengthen what remains,</b><br>The church in Sardis is urged to fortify the remnants of their faith and practice. This implies that while much has been lost, there is still a foundation that can be built upon. The idea of strengthening what remains can be compared to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where the faithful servant is commended for wisely using what he has been given. It suggests a call to return to foundational truths and practices.<p><b>which is about to die;</b><br>This phrase indicates the critical state of the church's spiritual life. The imagery of something about to die suggests urgency and the need for immediate action. It reflects the biblical theme of spiritual life and death, as seen in <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>, where faith without works is described as dead. The church is on the brink of losing its spiritual vitality completely.<p><b>for I have found your deeds incomplete</b><br>The deeds of the church in Sardis are described as lacking or unfinished. This suggests that while they may have started well, they have not brought their works to completion. This can be compared to the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>, where some seeds fall on rocky ground and do not mature. The call is to bring their works to full maturity and completion in Christ.<p><b>in the sight of My God.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes divine perspective and judgment. The deeds of the church are evaluated not by human standards but by God's standards. It echoes the biblical truth that God sees the heart and intentions behind actions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received visions from Jesus Christ while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_in_sardis.htm">Church in Sardis</a></b><br>One of the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation.

Though they had &#8220;a reputation for being alive&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>), their true condition was drowsy and dull to the things of God. Scripture repeatedly ties alertness to readiness for Christ&#8217;s return: <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11&#8211;12</a> speaks of waking from sleep because &#8220;our salvation is nearer now,&#8221; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a> urges believers to &#8220;remain awake and sober,&#8221; and <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a> says, &#8220;Wake up, O sleeper&#8230; and Christ will shine on you.&#8221; Jesus wants His people vigilant&#8212;eyes open to sin, open to opportunity, open to His imminent coming (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42&#8211;44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and strengthen what remains</b><p>Although Sardis was in danger, all was not lost.

For Christians today the passage drives home the need for continual repentance, vigilant obedience, and wholehearted works that stand complete before the Lord who sees all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Be watchful.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">become wakeful.</span> It will not do simply to rouse and sleepily grasp at their spiritual weapons, or even to stand for once at arms; you must become of wakeful habit.

The use of the present participle instead of an adjective ("watching!" for "watchful") makes the charge more definite; not merely "be of a watchful character," but "become a watcher" (comp. <a href="/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>; <a href="/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3, 7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stablish the things that remain, which were ready to die.</span> The reading, "were ready to die," is the best attested, and as being less smooth than "are ready to die," was more likely to be altered. It anticipates the time when the command will be obeyed: "which were ready to die when thou didst begin to stablish them." No doubt <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;</span> may be masculine in signification, and mean those members of the Church who have still some life in them. But this interpretation anticipates ver. 4, which apparently introduces a new fact. It seems better, therefore, to retain the neuter, and interpret "the things that remain" as meaning the few good elements of faith and practice which still survived. The externals of the Christian life were there; otherwise it could not have been even nominally Christian. And these externals might be made realities to support the revived life of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">For I have found no works of thine</span>. The difference between the Authorized Version and the Revised Version here depends upon the presence or absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>. The balance of probability is against <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, and its absence makes the reproach stronger. <span class="cmt_word">Fulfilled before my God</span>. The substitution of "fulfilled" (Revised Version) for "perfect" (Authorized Version) is important. The Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>; <a href="/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>, etc.), not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). And "fulfilled" is better than "complete" (Alford, Tregelles), in order to bring out the connexion with the numerous places in which the same verb occurs, especially in the writings of St. John (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/john/7-8.htm">John 7:8</a>; <a href="/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>; <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>; <a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11, 25</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a> 2John 12); in many of which passages "complete" would not stand as a rendering. "Fulfilled," or" made full," means made up to the right standard of excellence. The works of the Sardian Church have been weighed, and found wanting before God. "A minister of Christ is very often in highest honour with men for the performance of one half of his work, while God is regarding him with displeasure for the neglect of the other half." "Before <span class="accented">my</span> God" is undoubtedly the true reading, whatever may be the case in <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. Only in the writings of St. John does Jesus Christ speak of the Father as "my God;" and this fact is one more link between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. In this chapter we have five instances - here and ver. 12 (comp. <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> [possibly] and <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a> Christ adopts the language of <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, and addresses the Father as" my God;" and St. Paul uses similar language (<a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>). The expression, "before God" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is specially common in the Apocalypse and in the writings of St. Luke and of St. Paul; it does not occur in either St. Matthew or St. Mark. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Wake up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#961;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(gr&#275;gor&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1127.htm">Strong's 1127: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I am awake (in the night), watch, (b) I am watchful, on the alert, vigilant.
