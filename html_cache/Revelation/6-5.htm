The opening of the seals is a pivotal moment in the apocalyptic vision given to John, representing the progressive revelation of God's will and the events leading to the final judgment.<p><b>I heard the third living creature say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;</b><br>The third living creature is one of the four living creatures described in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, which are often interpreted as angelic beings or representations of creation that surround the throne of God.

Just as the first two seals loosed conquest and warfare (<a href="/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1&#8211;4</a>), this third seal brings economic upheaval.<p>&#8226; Because the Lamb Himself initiates the seal, the coming scarcity is neither random nor merely human&#8208;generated; it serves God&#8217;s righteous purpose of shaking an unrepentant world (<a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The third living creature says, &#8220;Come!&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;I heard the third living creature say, &#8216;Come!&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The four living creatures&#8212;angelic beings stationed around God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5&#8211;14</a>)&#8212;announce each of the first four seals.

And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living beings, saying</span>, <span class= "ital">A choenix of wheat for a denarius</span> (penny), <span class= "ital">and three choenixes of barley for a denarius</span> (penny), <span class= "ital">and the oil and the wine do thou not hurt.</span> "Balance:" There is scarcely a doubt that a balance, or pair of scales, is intended (the Greek word also means a yoke); but the whole imagery of the seal harmonises with the balance, and the passage from Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/45-10.htm" title="You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.">Ezekiel 45:10</a>), cited by Alford, in which there is a "righteous balance" (the LXX. using the same Greek word as here) seems conclusive. It is the emblem of scarcity: food is not weighed out thus in times of abundance. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16</a>, "Behold I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with care.") The choenix ("measure" in English version) was the amount of food sufficient to support a man for a day. "A choenix is the daily maintenance" (Suidas, quoted by Alford). The denarius ("penny" of English version, here and in <a href="/matthew/18-28.htm" title="But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that you owe.">Matthew 18:28</a>, and <a href="/mark/12-37.htm" title="David therefore himself calls him Lord; and from where is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.">Mark 12:37</a>) amounted to between sixpence and sevenpence of our money, and was the usual daily pay of the labourer, and of the soldier. (See especially Note on <a href="/matthew/20-2.htm" title="And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:2</a>.) It is difficult to speak of this as other than terribly high prices for food. The whole of a man's pay goes for food, and even the coarser bread is so expensive that it takes a whole day's wages to supply food for three adults. It has been thought that the voice calls to the rider to check his devastations, lest the growing famine should exterminate the whole human race. This may be, but the check is at a point which has already wrought the highest misery. The extent of the misery may be imagined by imagining what wretchedness would be entailed were a man obliged to pay three or four shillings for bread sufficient to keep him nourished for a day. Or we may measure it by the estimate of the disciples (<a href="/mark/6-37.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?">Mark 6:37</a>) that two hundred pennyworth of bread would give a short meal to upwards of five thousand people. At the price in this seal, the cost of bread would have so risen that the two hundred pennyworth of bread would not suffice to feed one thousand. But what is meant by the words, "the oil and wine do not thou hurt"? They were not, like the bread, necessary to life, but among its luxuries and superfluities. There is a kind of irony in times of straitness, when the necessaries are scarcely to be had, and the luxuries remain comparatively low in price. The splendours and comforts of life are held cheap, when hunger is showing that the life is more than the dainty meat, and the body than raiment. The seal then tells the seer that in the ages the Church of Christ must expect to see famines and distress in the world, and luxuries abounding in the midst of straitness. Is it not true that the contrast, which is so ugly, between pampered opulence and indolent, pauperism, is the result of the prevalence of world-principles? Wealth, self-indulgent and heartless, and poverty, reckless and self-willed, are sure tokens that the golden rule of Christ is not understood and obeyed. There is a similar experience in the history of the Church. The red horse of controversy is followed by the black horse of spiritual starvation. In the heat of polemical pride and passion for theological conquest is developed that love of barren dogmatics which forgets the milk of the word and the bread of life, which are the needed food of souls. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had opened the third seal;</span> <span class="accented">when he opened</span>, as in the case of the other seals (see on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">I heard the third beast say;</span> <span class="accented">the third living being saying.</span> (On the <span class="accented">living beings</span>, see <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>.) Wordsworth takes the <span class="accented">third living being</span> to be that with the human face, and considers it to be typical of the whole vision of the third seal, by symbolizing the source of the next trial of the Church; namely, the rise of heresy, which he thinks is depicted by this appearance. But probably the four living beings represent all creation, and thus invite St. John to witness the troubles in store for mankind in general. (For a full consideration of this point, see on Revelation 4:6.) <span class="cmt_word">Come and see.</span> The majority of authorities emit "and see" (see the corresponding passage in vers. 1 and 3, where also is discussed the question as to whom the sentence is addressed). <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and lo a black horse.</span> The <span class="accented">black</span> is typical of woe and mourning - the result of the scarcity foretold in the following words. This vision is typical of famine; it is the second of the three trials foretold - war, famine, death (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>, where the "four sore plagues" are wild beasts, the sword, famine, and pestilence). St. John seems to foretell the recurrence of three of these troubles to try mankind in general, and Christians in particular. Those who interpret the vision to mean scarcity of faith, or in other words the prevalence of heresy, do so on the supposition that the events denoted at the opening of the seals follow each other in historical order. They therefore assign these events to the period subsequent to A.D. , when persecution had ceased, and the rise of heresies took place. Others, accepting the historical view, yet consider the vision to foretell famine; and Grotius and Wetstein point to the famine in the reign of Claudius as the fulfilment. But it is not probable that the meaning of the book is so limited in extent; but rather that its prophecies point to events which have happened, and are recurring, and will continue to recur until the end of the world. We therefore understand that this vision denotes famine in the ordinary sense, as one of the trials awaiting the members of the Church of God at various times during the existence of the Church on earth. This affliction may happen concurrently with, or antecedent to, or subsequent to, any of those trials denoted by the other visions, and even the victorious career of the Church as foretold under the first seal; for by suffering the Church conquers and is made perfect. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</span> <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is rightly rendered "a balance," as in <a href="/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>; not (as it primarily meant) a "yoke." The idea intended to be conveyed is that of scarcity so great that food is weighed carefully as something very rare and precious, though there is not yet a complete absence of food. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
