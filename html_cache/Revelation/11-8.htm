The "great city" is often interpreted as Jerusalem, a central location in biblical prophecy and history. Jerusalem is significant as the spiritual and political center of Israel, and it plays a crucial role in eschatological events. The imagery of bodies lying in the street suggests a public display of defeat and humiliation, which contrasts with the ultimate victory of God's plan.<p><b>figuratively called Sodom and Egypt</b><br>The use of "figuratively" indicates that the names Sodom and Egypt are symbolic. Sodom is associated with extreme wickedness and divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. Egypt represents oppression and idolatry, recalling the Israelites' bondage and God's deliverance in the Exodus. By using these names, the text highlights the moral and spiritual corruption of the city, drawing parallels to past judgments and emphasizing the need for repentance.<p><b>where their Lord was also crucified</b><br>This phrase identifies the city as Jerusalem, where Jesus Christ was crucified. The crucifixion is central to Christian theology, representing the atoning sacrifice of Christ for humanity's sins. The mention of the crucifixion connects the suffering of the two witnesses to the suffering of Christ, suggesting a pattern of persecution for those who bear witness to God's truth. It also underscores the irony that the city, which should be a place of holiness, is instead marked by rejection of God's messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_witnesses.htm">The Two Witnesses</a></b><br>These are the prophetic figures whose bodies lie in the street.

not only for its past election (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>) but also for its future role during the Tribulation, when &#8220;the nations will trample the holy city for forty-two months&#8221;

The world&#8217;s contempt will only magnify God&#8217;s power when He raises the witnesses, just as He raised His Son, proving that no display of human rebellion can overturn His sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8-10) <span class= "bld">And their dead bodies . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And their corpse </span>(is)<span class= "ital"> upon the street of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified. And some from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations look upon their corpse three days and a half, and do not suffer their corpses to be put into a tomb. And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.</span> Their corpses remain unburied, while congratulations and rejoicings go on; harmony and concord prevail, as when Pilate and Herod were made friends; it is the millennium of evil, the paradise of fools who make a mock at sin; but the forms of the witnesses, though silenced, still in silence witness against evil. At no time are they hid away out of sight. Even in an age of religious and social anarchy the silent tokens of a better order remain, as when in mockery and profanation the harlot was enthroned within Notre Dame, the very sanctuary walls, which no longer echoed to the psalm of Christian life, yet bore silent testimony to the higher genius of the past. They are said to lie in "the street of the great city." The city is described as the great city (comp. <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>), and also as Sodom, Egypt, and Jerusalem. Do not passages like this show conclusively that to deny the mystical or allegorical sense of the Apocalypse is to keep the husk and cast away the seed? The city is great, for it is all-important in the eyes of the inhabitants, as public opinion is all-important to the weak or the worldly; it is Sodom, for it is the place where, through pleasure and luxuriousness (fulness of bread), the worst forms of immorality take root; it is Egypt, for it is the house of bondage, where the wages of sin become tyrannous; it is Jerusalem, for it is the apostate place where the presence of Christ is hated. The same spirit which slew their Lord is alive to persecute His servants. "It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household;" and the reason of this hatred is told--the words of the witnesses "tormented them." "The reproof of their gospel and the reproof of their example . . . had been a torture to them; there was a voice in them which echoed its voice--the voice of a convicting conscience, and the voice of an anticipated judgment."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified</span>; <span class="accented">their dead body</span> (in the singular), according to A, B, C, Arethas, and others. The plural is read in N, P, Andreas, Primasius, and others. Omit "lie upon the highway... their Lord." "The great city" is referred to in <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10-19</a>. Its signification is always the same, viz. the type of what is ungodly and of the world, and it is always consigned to punishment. Jerusalem, the type of what is holy, is never thus designated. Here we are plainly told the <span class="accented">spiritual</span>, that is, the symbolical nature of the designation. <span class="accented">Sodom</span> and <span class="accented">Egypt are</span> chosen as the type of what is evil (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>, etc.). It was in this city, that is, by the influence of this world power, that the Lord was crucified. In describing the fate of the Church, St. John seems to have in mind the life of Christ. His witness, the opposition he encountered, his death for a brief time at the completion of his work, his resurrection and ascension, and triumph over the devil, are all here reproduced. "The bodies lie in the street" symbolizes, according to Jewish custom, the most intense scorn and hatred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
