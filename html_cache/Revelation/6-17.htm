The "great day" signifies a time of unprecedented divine intervention in human history, where God's justice is fully revealed. The use of "Their wrath" indicates the involvement of both God the Father and Jesus Christ, emphasizing the unity of the Godhead in executing judgment. This aligns with Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, which describe a day of darkness and destruction. The concept of divine wrath is rooted in God's holiness and justice, responding to the persistent sin and rebellion of humanity.<p><b>and who is able to withstand it?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the absolute power and authority of God in judgment. It implies that no one, regardless of status or strength, can resist or escape the divine wrath once it is unleashed. This echoes similar sentiments found in <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, where the overwhelming nature of God's judgment is highlighted. The question serves to humble humanity, reminding believers of their dependence on God's mercy and grace. It also points to the necessity of being in right standing with God through faith in Jesus Christ, who alone can provide refuge from the coming wrath, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>In the context of Revelation, the Lamb refers to Jesus Christ, who is central to the unfolding events of the end times.

Every advent of Christ is the advent of One whose fan is in His hand, and who will thoroughly purge His floor. Whether it be His advent in the flesh, He tested men; or whether one of His advents in Providence--such as the fall of Jerusalem, the overthrow of Pagan Rome, the convulsions of the Reformation and Revolution epochs of history--He still tests men whether they are able to abide in faith and love the day of His coming; and much more, then, in the closing personal advent, when these visions will receive their fullest illustration, will He try men. "Who is able to stand?" It is the question of questions. Christ's answer is: "Apart from Me ye can do nothing." "Let your loins be girt about and your lights burning, and ye yourselves like to men that wait for their Lord's coming." And parallel is St. Paul's advice<span class= "ital">:</span> "Wherefore take unto you, (not the weapons on which men rely, but) the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand." This anxiety that his converts should be ready for the day of testing is continually appearing in his Epistles. Comp, the recurrence of "the day of Christ" in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-10.htm" title="That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.">Philippians 1:10</a>, and the Apostle's wish that the Philippians might be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; and St. John's desire that Christians should not "be ashamed before Him at His coming," and "may have boldness in the day of judgment" (<a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1John 4:17</a>). "Who is able to stand?" The question is answered in the next chapter. They shall stand who are sealed with the seal of the living God.<p>The sixth seal does not give us a completed picture. We see the great and awe-inspiring movements which are heralds of the day of wrath. The whole world is stirred and startled at the tread of the approaching Christ, and then the vision melts away; we see no more, but we have seen enough to be sure that the close of the age is at hand. Yet we are anxious to know something of those who have been faithful, pure, and chivalrous witnesses for truth and right, for Christ and God. In that day, that awful day, the whole population of the world seems to be smitten with dismay; the trees, shaken with that terrible tempest, seem to be shedding all their fruit; the trembling of all created things seems to be about to shake down every building. Are all to go? Are none strong enough to survive? We heard that there were seven seals attached to the mystic book which the Lion of the tribe of Judah was opening; but this sixth seal presents us with the picture of universal desolation; what is there left for the seventh seal to tell us? The answer to these questions is given in the seventh chapter, which introduces scenes which may either be taken as dissolving views, presented in the course of the sixth seal, or as complementary visions. And those scenes show us in pictorial form that the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation: that in the midst of the time of the shaking of all things, when all might, majesty, strength, and genius of men is laid low, and every mere earth-born kingdom is overthrown, there is a kingdom which cannot be shaken. The germ of life was indestructible, and ready to break forth in fruit again: an ark, which sheltered all that was good, moved ever secure over the desolating floods:-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the great day of his wrath is come.</span> <span class="accented">Of their wrath</span>, which is read in the Revised Version, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, 38, Vulgate, Syriae; but <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "his," is supported by A, B, F, Coptic, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius. The article is repeated, making the term almost a proper name - the <span class="accented">day, the great</span> [<span class="accented">day</span>]. Alford remarks that this of itself should be sufficient to keep commentators right in confining their interpretation of this seal to the last judgment (cf. <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 2</a>; <a href="/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). And who shall be able to stand? <span class="accented">Who is able</span> (Revised Version). Thus <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, "Who shall stand when he appeareth?" And <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>. Thus, then, the question in ver. 10, "How long?" is answered; not by limiting the length of time, but by a renewed assurance of an awful termination of the course of the world, at the appearance of the Judge. The dread attending that end is vividly portrayed, and the fear of the wicked, with their conscience-stricken inquiry, "Who is able to stand?" an answer to which is required for the edification of the faithful. And, therefore, the seer immediately describes the preservation of the righteous from amidst the destruction of the wicked, and their raptured praises, a joyous contrast with the despairing fate of those whose doom has just been narrated. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
