This judgment echoes the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>) and serves as a reminder of God's power over creation. The intense heat can be seen as a literal event or symbolic of spiritual fervor and trial. In the context of Revelation, it signifies the severity of God's judgment during the end times, aligning with prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a> and <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, where the earth is burned and the wicked are consumed.<p><b>and they cursed the name of God</b><br>Despite the clear divine origin of the plagues, the people's response is one of blasphemy rather than repentance. This reaction highlights the hardness of human hearts and the fulfillment of prophecies about end-time rebellion against God (<a href="/2_timothy/3.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>). Cursing God's name is a direct violation of the commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, showing a deep-seated defiance and rejection of God's authority.<p><b>who had authority over these plagues</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and control over the events unfolding in Revelation. It reflects the biblical theme that God is the ultimate authority over all creation and history (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>). The plagues are not random acts of nature but are divinely orchestrated judgments, similar to those in Egypt, demonstrating God's power and justice (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>Yet they did not repent and give Him glory</b><br>Despite the severity of the judgments, the people refuse to repent, illustrating the depth of human sinfulness and resistance to God. This refusal to repent is a recurring theme in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20-21</a>) and serves as a warning of the consequences of hardening one's heart against God. The call to give God glory is a call to recognize His rightful place as Creator and Judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where all are ultimately called to acknowledge God's glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people.htm">People</a></b><br>The verse refers to those who are experiencing the plagues.

(On the meaning of the first clause, see on ver. 8.) This is the first mention in the vials of men blaspheming. As with Pharaoh and the Egyptians, the judgments of God, instead of awakening them to repentance, only serve to harden their hearts. This again occurs under the fifth and seventh vials. So also in the sixth trumpet, we are told, men repented not - a statement also made in the subsequent part of this verse. As before pointed out (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), the two things are identical; non repentance, continuance in the service of the dragon, is blasphemy against God; though we generally reserve the name "blasphemy" for the open avowal of infidelity to God. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath power over these plagues.</span> This is what is implied in the words of ver. 8, "it was given to it?'
