Their presence indicates a connection between the Old and New Covenants. The elder speaking to John signifies the importance of the message being delivered, as elders in biblical times were figures of authority and wisdom.<p><b>Do not weep!</b><br>John's weeping reflects the deep sorrow and despair over the apparent inability to open the scroll, which contains God's redemptive plan. The elder's command to cease weeping introduces hope and assurance, a common biblical theme where divine intervention alleviates human distress.<p><b>Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah</b><br>The "Lion" symbolizes strength, majesty, and kingship. This title is rooted in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9-10</a>, where Jacob blesses his son Judah, prophesying that the scepter will not depart from him. This establishes a messianic expectation that the Messiah would come from Judah's lineage, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>The Root of David</b><br>This phrase connects to <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1 and 11</a>:10, where the Messiah is described as a shoot from the stump of Jesse, David's father. It emphasizes Jesus' rightful claim to the throne of David, fulfilling the Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) and underscoring His eternal kingship.<p><b>Has triumphed</b><br>The triumph refers to Jesus' victory over sin and death through His crucifixion and resurrection. This victory is not just a past event but has ongoing implications for the unfolding of God's plan, as it enables the opening of the scroll.<p><b>To open the scroll and its seven seals</b><br>The scroll represents God's comprehensive plan for judgment and redemption. The seven seals indicate completeness and divine perfection.

The verse has been translated, "Behold, one conquered, (even) the Lion . . ." The right to open the roll is thus made to turn, as we noticed before, not merely on the divine Sonship of our Lord, but upon His victory: He conquered, and so opens the secret purposes of God to His Church. The thought is exactly parallel with other scriptures which give emphasis to the work of redemption. It is "for the suffering of death" that Christ is clothed "with glory and honour" (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>). Similarly St. Paul traces the exaltation of Christ as the outcome of His humiliation, "<span class= "ital">wherefore (i.e.,</span> in consequence of His humiliation) God also hath highly exalted Him" (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9</a>). Thus Christ, who in conquest is seen to be the power of God, in revealing the true philosophy of history is seen to be the wisdom of God.<p><span class= "bld">The Lion of the tribe of Juda--</span>The lion was the ancient symbol of the tribe of Judah. Jacob described his son as "a lion's whelp" (<a href="/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a>); the standard of Judah in the Israelitish encampment is said to have been a lion. It was the symbol of strength, courage, and sovereignty.<p><span class= "bld">The Root of David.--</span>The Lion is also the representative of the royal house of David. <span class= "ital">"</span>Christ cometh of the seed of David" (comp. <a href="/mark/12-35.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?">Mark 12:35</a> with <a href="/john/8-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.">John 8:42</a>); the prophets have described Him as the Branch, which would spring from the ancient stock (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>). But there seems also a reference to the deeper thought that He who is the Branch is also the Root (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm" title="And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.">Isaiah 11:10</a>); He is the one who was David's Lord (<a href="/context/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,">Matthew 22:41-45</a>), and "the true source and ground of all power" to David and David's tribe, and of all who looked to Him, and not to themselves, for strength. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not</span>. One of the elders, as representing the Church (see on Revelation 4:4), bids St. John to take heed to him who was about to disclose to some extent the future of that Church. There is, of course, no indication that any particular individual is signified, though some have striven to identify the elder. Thus De Lyra mentions St. Peter, who was already martyred; others, referred to by De Lyra, say St. Matthew, who, in his Gospel, declares Christ's power (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda. The title is accorded to Christ, in illustration of the following act. The Representative of the royal and victorious tribe of Judah was he who had prevailed to open the book, where others had failed (cf. <a href="/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9</a>, "Judah is a lion's whelp;" <a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>, "For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah"). <span class="cmt_word">The Root of David</span>. The Root of David is a synonym for <span class="accented">Stem</span> or <span class="accented">Branch</span> (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, "There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots;" and <a href="/romans/15-12.htm">Romans 15:12</a>, "Esaias saith, There shall be a Root of Jesse"). Further, Christ may be said to have been the Root of David, by virtue of his pre-existence and his creative power. It is one of the paradoxes of the Incarnation, that he who is the Root of David should also be a Branch. <span class="cmt_word">Hath prevailed to open the book</span>; <span class="accented">hath conquered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). Not, as the Authorized Version appears to read, that the act of victory consisted in the opening of the book, but the ability to open was a consequence of a former act of victory, viz. the redemption. So in ver. 9 the ascription of praise runs, "Thou art worthy <span class="accented">because</span> thou wast slain" (on the infinitive epexegetic, see Winer). Some see a reference here to <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>, "He that openeth, and no man shutteth." <span class="cmt_word">And to loose the seven seals thereof;</span> <span class="accented">and the seven seals thereof</span> (Revised Version).
