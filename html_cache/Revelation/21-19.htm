The use of precious stones signifies beauty, value, and permanence. In ancient times, such stones were symbols of wealth and status, often used in royal settings. Biblically, precious stones are associated with the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>), symbolizing God's people and His covenant with them. The adornment of the city walls with these stones reflects the glory and holiness of God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>The first foundation was jasper,</b><br>Jasper is often described as a clear, crystalline stone, possibly resembling a diamond. In <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>, God Himself is described as having an appearance like jasper, indicating purity and divine majesty. The use of jasper as the first foundation stone underscores the purity and holiness of the New Jerusalem, setting the tone for the entire city.<p><b>the second sapphire,</b><br>Sapphire is a deep blue stone, symbolizing heaven and divine revelation. In <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, the pavement under God's feet is described as being like sapphire, suggesting a connection to the divine presence. The use of sapphire in the foundation may represent the heavenly origin and nature of the New Jerusalem, emphasizing its connection to God's throne.<p><b>the third chalcedony,</b><br>Chalcedony is a translucent stone, often with a bluish hue. It is less frequently mentioned in the Bible, but its inclusion here suggests a unique aspect of beauty and diversity in God's creation. The presence of chalcedony in the foundation may symbolize the variety and richness of God's kingdom, where every believer has a place.<p><b>the fourth emerald,</b><br>Emerald is a bright green stone, symbolizing life, renewal, and immortality. In <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>, a rainbow resembling an emerald encircles God's throne, indicating His eternal covenant and mercy.

He that saveth his life, loseth it; he that loseth, saveth it; he that is content to pass by the dazzling attractions of the world, refusing splendour from the outstretched hand of Babylon, will win the true spiritual riches.
