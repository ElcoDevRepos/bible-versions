It echoes the words of Jesus in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a> and <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, where He often used similar language to urge listeners to truly understand His teachings. The "ear" symbolizes the ability to perceive and comprehend spiritual truths, suggesting that not everyone will be receptive to the message.<p><b>let him hear</b><br>This is an imperative command, urging the listener to actively engage with the message being delivered. In the biblical context, hearing implies obedience and response, not just passive listening. This call to hear is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where the Shema begins with "Hear, O Israel," underscoring the importance of listening to God's word with the intent to act upon it.<p><b>what the Spirit says</b><br>The Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, who communicates God's will and truth to believers. In the context of Revelation, the Spirit is the divine source of the messages to the churches, indicating that these are not merely human words but divinely inspired instructions. This aligns with <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, where Jesus promises that the Spirit of truth will guide believers into all truth.<p><b>to the churches</b><br>The term "churches" refers to the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation chapters 2 and 3. These were real, historical congregations located in cities such as Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamum. Each church receives a specific message tailored to its unique circumstances, yet the messages also have a universal application for all churches throughout history. This reflects the communal nature of the early Christian faith and the shared challenges and responsibilities faced by believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_churches_of_asia.htm">The Seven Churches of Asia</a></b><br>The immediate recipients of the messages in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, representing the broader Christian church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The divine communicator of the messages to the churches, emphasizing the need for spiritual discernment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The collective body of believers who are called to heed the messages and apply them to their lives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/patmos.htm">Patmos</a></b><br>The island where John received the Revelation, symbolizing isolation but also divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Believers are called to develop a keen sense of spiritual hearing, attuned to the Holy Spirit's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_listening.htm">Active Listening</a></b><br>The phrase "He who has an ear" implies an active, intentional effort to understand and apply God's word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_message.htm">Universal Message</a></b><br>Although addressed to specific churches, the message is relevant to all believers, emphasizing the timeless nature of God's word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_respond.htm">Responsibility to Respond</a></b><br>Hearing the Spirit's message comes with the responsibility to act upon it, leading to spiritual growth and maturity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The collective call to the churches highlights the importance of communal discernment and accountability in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_2_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 2:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_truly_hear_the_Spirit_today.htm">How can we ensure we are truly "listening to what the Spirit says" today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Holy_Spirit_s_role_in_church_decisions.htm">What role does the Holy Spirit play in guiding the church's decisions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Revelation_2_29_to_Jesus_Gospels.htm">How does Revelation 2:29 connect to Jesus' teachings in the Gospels?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Spirit_s_guidance_daily.htm">In what ways can we apply the Spirit's guidance in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Why_must_believers_heed_the_Spirit.htm">Why is it important for every believer to heed the Spirit's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Rev_2_29_s_phrase_signify.htm">What does "He who has an ear, let him hear" signify in Revelation 2:29?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_2_29_Divine_message_challenge.htm">How does Revelation 2:29 challenge our understanding of divine communication?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_repeat_listen_in_Revelation_2_29.htm">Why is the call to listen repeated in Revelation 2:29?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_beliefs_be_chosen_freely.htm">What is the meaning of Hidden Manna?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_was_sardis_church's_message.htm">What message was given to the Church in Sardis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_symbolizes_the_white_stone_in_rev_2_17.htm">What does the white stone symbolize in Revelation 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_church_in_smyrna_important.htm">What is the significance of the Church in Smyrna?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 2:29 Mean</div><b>He who has an ear</b><p>Jesus opens with a universal call.

By saying &#8220;He who has an ear,&#8221; the Lord invites every listener to self-examination:<p>&#8226; Do I have the spiritual capacity to respond?<p>&#8226; Am I willing to submit to what I am about to hear?<p><a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a> records Jesus repeating the same phrase after the Parable of the Sower, underscoring that receptivity precedes fruitfulness. <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> shows the identical wording, proving that this invitation is consistent across all seven letters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let him hear</b><p>Hearing in biblical thought includes heeding&#8212;an obedient response, not passive reception (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221;.
