The imagery of eating flesh is symbolic of complete destruction and humiliation, often used in prophetic literature to signify the downfall of the wicked (<a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>). Kings, commanders, and mighty men represent the highest echelons of human authority and power, emphasizing that no one is exempt from God's judgment. This reflects the theme of divine retribution found throughout Revelation, where earthly powers are often depicted as opposing God's kingdom.<p><b>of horses and riders</b><br>Horses and riders symbolize military strength and the instruments of war. In ancient times, horses were a key component of military might, and their inclusion here underscores the futility of human efforts against divine power. This imagery is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where God demonstrated His supremacy over Pharaoh's chariots and horsemen (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-28</a>). It serves as a reminder that God's judgment will dismantle all forms of human resistance.<p><b>of everyone slave and free, small and great.</b><br>This phrase highlights the universality of God's judgment, encompassing all social and economic classes. The inclusion of both slave and free, small and great, indicates that divine justice is impartial and all-encompassing. It echoes the theme of equality before God found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female are transcended in Christ. This serves as a sobering reminder that all humanity is accountable to God, regardless of status or position.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_commanders.htm">Kings and Commanders</a></b><br>These represent the highest levels of earthly authority and power. In the context of Revelation, they symbolize those who oppose God's rule and align with the forces of evil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men.htm">Mighty Men</a></b><br>This term refers to warriors or those with great strength and influence. In the biblical account, they often represent human pride and reliance on physical power rather than God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_and_riders.htm">Horses and Riders</a></b><br>Horses are often associated with war and conquest in biblical literature. Riders symbolize those who wield power and control, often in opposition to God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/everyone,_slave_and_free.htm">Everyone, Slave and Free</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and inclusivity of God's judgment. It signifies that no one, regardless of social status, is exempt from accountability before God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_supper_of_god.htm">The Great Supper of God</a></b><br>This event is a symbolic depiction of divine judgment, where the forces of evil are defeated, and God's justice is fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is comprehensive and unavoidable.

Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God rather than human strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inclusivity_of_god's_justice.htm">The Inclusivity of God's Justice</a></b><br>God's justice applies to all, regardless of social or economic status. This calls for humility and a recognition of our equal standing before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_repentance.htm">The Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The imagery of judgment serves as a warning and an invitation to repentance.

When Christ appears, every political and military leader who has joined the beast&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>) is instantly stripped of rank and life.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-9</a> shows kings gathering against the Lord only to be shattered by His iron scepter&#8212;exactly what happens here.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a> already foretold rulers hiding in caves; now their hiding is over, and judgment is final.<p>The image of birds consuming their flesh underscores how completely Christ overturns human authority that dared oppose Him. Earthly thrones cannot stand when the rightful King arrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mighty Men</b><p>Next come &#8220;mighty men.&#8221; These are the celebrated champions, generals, and war heroes the world applauded. Yet <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-17</a> reminds us the Lord has a day &#8220;against all the proud and lofty,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/46-12.htm">Jeremiah 46:12</a> says even the mighty &#8220;stumble continually.&#8221; At Armageddon their strength evaporates; carrion birds make no distinction between a decorated warrior and an untrained recruit.

The very war machines meant to secure victory become carcasses. God&#8217;s sovereignty extends over technology and strategy; neither beast nor rider escapes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everyone Slave and Free</b><p>The verse widens: &#8220;everyone slave and free.&#8221; Social status offered no exemption earlier (<a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>), and it offers none now. Whether oppressed by the beast or willingly branded by him, every individual who took up arms with evil faces the same fate. <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a> reminds us &#8220;there is no favoritism with God&#8221;; final judgment is perfectly impartial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Small and Great</b><p>The crescendo ends with &#8220;small and great,&#8221; a phrase echoed in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> when all humanity stands before the great white throne.

The scavenger birds symbolize complete, humiliating destruction for every level of society that united against the Lamb&#8212;rulers, warriors, machinery of war, and followers without distinction. The scene assures believers that no enemy, however exalted, survives the King of kings, and it warns unbelievers that allegiance to earthly power ends in utter ruin when Jesus appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great</span> (cf. the description in <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>). <span class="accented">All men</span>; that is, all the ungodly.
