In biblical symbolism, angels often serve as messengers or agents of God's will. The "angel of the waters" suggests a specific role or domain, possibly overseeing the waters affected by the judgments described in Revelation. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The mention of hearing emphasizes the revelatory nature of John's vision, a common feature in apocalyptic literature.<p><b>Righteous are You, O Holy One,</b><br>This declaration affirms God's righteousness and holiness, central attributes of His character. Throughout Scripture, God's righteousness is linked to His just actions and moral perfection (<a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). The title "Holy One" underscores His purity and separateness from sin, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim God's holiness. This acknowledgment of God's righteousness is crucial in the context of divine judgment, affirming that His actions are just and deserved.<p><b>who is and was,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal nature, a recurring theme in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>). It emphasizes His timeless existence and unchanging character, contrasting with the temporal nature of creation. This eternal perspective assures believers of God's ultimate control over history and His ability to fulfill His promises. The phrase echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," signifying God's self-existence and constancy.<p><b>because You have brought these judgments.</b><br>The judgments referred to are the plagues described earlier in <a href="/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>, part of the series of divine judgments poured out upon the earth. This phrase attributes these actions directly to God, affirming His active role in executing justice. In the biblical narrative, God's judgments serve as both punishment for sin and a call to repentance, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). The acknowledgment of God's role in these judgments reinforces the theme of divine justice and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_waters.htm">Angel of the Waters</a></b><br>This angel is a messenger of God, specifically associated with the waters.

These glimpses remind us that every part of creation is under God&#8217;s delegated authority.<p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s voice confirms that what is happening to the rivers and springs is no random disaster; it is a measured act flowing from heaven&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By allowing us to &#8220;overhear&#8221; this angel, the Spirit reassures believers that even in the most terrifying judgments, heaven remains orderly and purposeful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Righteous are You</b><p>The very first words out of the angel&#8217;s mouth celebrate God&#8217;s moral perfection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> calls Him &#8220;a God of faithfulness and without injustice; righteous and upright is He.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a> echoes, &#8220;Righteous are You, O LORD, and upright are Your judgments.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3-4</a> has already heard the song of the redeemed declare the same truth just before the bowls are poured out.<p>Because God is righteous, His judgments can never be excessive or unfair.

An angel entrusted with earth&#8217;s waters praises God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, eternity, and justice. Far from questioning the severity of the plagues, heaven celebrates them as the perfect outworking of God&#8217;s unchanging character. For believers, the verse is a bracing reminder that every act of divine judgment&#8212;no matter how overwhelming&#8212;flows from a God who is eternally righteous, utterly holy, and flawlessly just.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5-7) But this state of things is declared to be a just retribution, and reasonably so; for the corruption arises because the true power of life has been rejected: it is the refusal of the good, the want of the life-giving element, which is the secret of all death, physical, moral, spiritual. "'Tis life we want when breath is scant." The world-power and its worshippers have driven away goodness and faith, the elements of the higher life of man; they have slain the just and the righteous, who were the salt of the earth; they have rejected Christ, who is the life of men; how can they reap anything but decay and death? They slay the righteous; the death of righteousness leaves them nothing but the lifeless blood behind; they can no longer drink moral life from the good; there is but the legacy of death. "Blood of saints and prophets did they pour out; and blood didst Thou give them to drink."<p>(5) <span class= "bld">And I heard the angel of the waters . . .</span>--That is, the angel who was set over the waters, or the angel who is, on the heavenly side, representative of the waters.

Here we have a reference to the angel whose duty it is to control the rivers, just as, in <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, another angel is represented as having authority over fire. This verse and the following one are anticipations of <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, which is a commentary on <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which latter is an elaboration of the judgments here described. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus;</span> <span class="accented">righteous art thou, which art and which wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge</span> (Revised Version). There is scarcely any authority for inserting "O Lord," or "and shalt be" (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). The angel, as having authority over the waters, and, as it were, a commission to see that they do their duty for men, acknowledges the justice of the sentence which makes them into an instrument for, and type of, man's destruction. Though there is no authority for inserting "and shalt be," the idea is, no doubt, to express the eternal nature of God. The same expression occurs in <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a> (Revised Version) in almost exactly parallel connection; so also in <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17, 18</a>. <span class="accented">Thou hast judged thus</span> refers to the judgment of the third vial, possibly to all the first three, Note the marginal reading of the Revised Version (supported by Alford), which disconnects this verse from the succeeding one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
