In biblical symbolism, the square often represents stability and perfection. The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and temple was also a perfect square, indicating a place of divine presence. This imagery connects the New Jerusalem to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to dwell among His people. The equal width and length emphasize the city's perfect proportions, symbolizing the harmony and balance of God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>And he measured the city with the rod, and all its dimensions were equal&#8212;</b><br>The act of measuring the city with a rod signifies the precision and intentionality of God's design. In biblical times, measuring was often associated with ownership, judgment, or preparation for construction. The equal dimensions highlight the city's perfection and completeness, reflecting God's perfect plan for His creation. This measurement echoes the vision of Ezekiel's temple, where precise measurements were given, symbolizing God's meticulous care and sovereignty.<p><b>12,000 stadia in length and width and height.</b><br>The measurement of 12,000 stadia, approximately 1,400 to 1,500 miles, suggests an immense and vast city, far beyond any earthly city.

The equal length, width, and height suggest a cube, reminiscent of the Holy of Holies, indicating the entire city is a sacred space where God's presence dwells. This imagery points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to be with His people, as seen in prophecies throughout Scripture, such as <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City (New Jerusalem)</a></b><br>This is the heavenly city described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, representing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people.

Many interpreters are nervously anxious about the monstrous appearance of a city whose walls measured three thousand stadii (the word rendered "furlongs" is properly <span class= "ital">stadii</span>); but there is no need to be nervous about the symbols; the city is not designed, any more than the vision of Revelation 4, or the vision of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1) to be represented by painting to the eye: the attempt to do so only ends in the production of grotesque and profane pictures. It is not needful, however, in this case to suppose the actual wall to have been 3,000 stadii in height; the city is placed on a hill, the foundations are upon the holy hill, and the deep strong mountain foundations may be included in the measurement. The main thought, however, is to realise the harmony and proportion of that community, in which broad and low and high will meet, and in which no truth will be exaggerated or distorted; in which no disproportioned adjustments will mar its social order; in which all those who are inbuilt as living stones will be measured, not by the false estimates of worldly thoughts (comp. <a href="/james/2-4.htm" title="Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?">James 2:4</a>), but by the golden reed of the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth.</span> The shape is doubtless typical of that which is complete and symmetrical, to which nothing is wanting to render the shape perfect.

And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. That is, in each direction. (On <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "furlong," see <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>.) The number twelve thousand, which is the number of the sealed in each tribe (<a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>.), is typical of <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a large number, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a complete number (see on ver. 12). <p>There seems to be in this description a designed reference to the literal Babylon (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Babylon"). The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. The plain meaning seems to be that the city forms a vast cube, and this is typical of its perfect nature. The account given is that of a vision, and not of a reality, and therefore there is no need to attempt to reduce the enormous dimensions given here, as is done by some writers. The holy of holies was thus cubical in shape (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
