The imagery of pregnancy represents the anticipation of the coming Messiah, who would be born from the lineage of Israel. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman is foretold to crush the serpent's head, indicating the birth of Christ.<p><b>and crying out</b><br>The crying out signifies the intense longing and expectation for deliverance and redemption. This can be seen as a reflection of Israel's historical struggles and their yearning for the Messiah. It also echoes the groaning of creation mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, where all creation is described as groaning in the pains of childbirth, awaiting redemption.<p><b>in the pain and agony of giving birth.</b><br>The pain and agony highlight the suffering and tribulation that precede the birth of something new and significant. This can be connected to the trials faced by Israel throughout history, including oppression and exile, as they awaited the Messiah. It also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who endured agony for the redemption of humanity. The imagery of birth pains is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the end times and the coming of God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>, <a href="/mark/13-8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's people, often interpreted as Israel or the Church.

The text then says, &#8220;She was pregnant,&#8221; highlighting a literal expectancy within the nation of Israel for the promised Messiah.<p>- From the fall of humanity, God&#8217;s people have lived in anticipation of a Deliverer (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, &#8220;Behold, the virgin will be with child and give birth to a son&#8221;). That promise moved from prophecy to history when &#8220;when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son, born of a woman&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>- The pregnancy image speaks not only of Mary&#8217;s literal maternity but also of Israel&#8217;s centuries-long role as the covenant people through whom Christ would come (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Crying out in the pain</b><p>- &#8220;Crying out&#8221; captures the distress Israel experienced leading up to Christ&#8217;s birth. Roman occupation, Herod&#8217;s tyranny (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16&#8211;18</a>), and spiritual barrenness created intense longing for deliverance.<p>- Scripture often links Israel&#8217;s suffering with labor-like groans (<a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9&#8211;10</a>). Paul expands the thought to the whole creation: &#8220;We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p>- The phrase also foreshadows a future season of unparalleled anguish&#8212;the &#8220;time of Jacob&#8217;s distress&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>) and the &#8220;great tribulation&#8221; Jesus describes in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>. Such anguish propels God&#8217;s redemptive plan forward and reminds believers that suffering here is temporary and purposeful (<a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Agony of giving birth</b><p>- Labor pain intensifies just before delivery.

The pregnancy spotlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises; the cries reveal the real cost of redemption; the agony underscores that deliverance often emerges from distress. In every stage, the passage assures us that God brings life out of pain, hope out of hardship, and ultimate victory through the One Israel delivered to the world&#8212;Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And she . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And being with child</span>, <span class= "ital">she crieth, travailing</span>, <span class= "ital">and tormented to bring forth.</span> All life dawns in anguish, according to the ancient fiat (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>); but this is not all. There is an anguish of the Church which Christ laid upon her; it is the law of her life that she must bring forth Christ to the world; it is not simply that she must encounter pain, but that she cannot work deliverance without knowing suffering. Thus the Apostles felt: the love of Christ constrained them; woe it would be to them if they did not preach the Gospel; necessity was laid upon them; they spoke of themselves as travailing in birth over their children till Christ was formed in them. This, then, is the picture, the Church fulfilling her destiny even in pain. The work was to bring forth Christ to men, and never to be satisfied till Christ was formed in them, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> till the spirit of Christ, and the teaching of Christ, and the example of Christ were received, loved, and obeyed, and men transformed to the same image, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.<p>But there was to be opposition; the enemy is on the watch to destroy the likeness of Christ wherever it was seen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</span> The present, "crieth," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, Coptic, Andreas in <span class="accented">a</span> et <span class="accented">bav.</span>, etc.; the imperfect, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, is read in C, Vulgate, 7, 8, 31, etc., Andreas in <span class="accented">c</span> et <span class="accented">p</span>, Primasius; the aorist, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, in B, twelve cursives (cf. the words of our Lord in <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21, 22</a>).

The trouble which afflicted the Jewish Church, and the longing of the patriarchs for the advent of the Saviour, are here depicted.
