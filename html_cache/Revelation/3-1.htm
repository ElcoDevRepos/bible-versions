Sardis was a wealthy city in Asia Minor, known for its luxury and complacency. It was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia and had a reputation for being impregnable due to its strategic location on a hill. However, it was twice captured due to negligence, which parallels the spiritual complacency addressed in this letter.<p><b>These are the words of the One who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars:</b><br>The "One" refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His divine authority and omniscience. The "seven spirits of God" symbolize the fullness and perfection of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which describes the Spirit's attributes. The "seven stars" represent the angels or leaders of the seven churches, as explained in <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>, indicating Christ's sovereign control and care over His church.<p><b>I know your deeds;</b><br>This phrase underscores Christ's omniscience and His intimate knowledge of the church's actions. It echoes the message to other churches in Revelation, where Christ assesses their works, both good and bad. This knowledge is not just of outward actions but also of the heart's intentions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>you have a reputation for being alive,</b><br>The church in Sardis was known for its outward appearance of vitality and activity. This reputation might have been due to its size, wealth, or influence. However, this external perception did not match the internal reality. This serves as a warning against hypocrisy and the danger of relying on past achievements or appearances, similar to the Pharisees criticized by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>.<p><b>yet you are dead.</b><br>Despite its reputation, the church was spiritually lifeless. This stark contrast highlights the danger of spiritual complacency and the need for genuine faith and repentance. The church's condition is reminiscent of the warning in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> that faith without works is dead. It calls for self-examination and revival, urging believers to seek true spiritual life through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_church_in_sardis.htm">The Angel of the Church in Sardis</a></b><br>The "angel" refers to the messenger or leader of the church in Sardis, a city known for its wealth and historical significance in Asia Minor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_sardis.htm">The Church in Sardis</a></b><br>This is one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation.

It was the great <span class= "ital">entrepot</span> of dyed woollen fabrics, the sheep of "many-flocked" Phrygia supplying the raw material. The art of dyeing is said to have been invented here; and many-coloured carpets or mats found in the houses of the wealthy were manufactured here. The metal known as electrum, a kind of bronze, was the produce of Sardis; and in early times gold-dust was found in the sand of the Pactolus, the little stream which passed through the Agora of Sardis, and washed the walls of the Temple of Cybele. It is said that gold and silver coins were first, minted at Sardis, and that resident merchants first became a class there. An earthquake laid it waste in the reign of Tiberius; a pestilence followed, but the city seems to have recovered its prosperity before the date of this epistle. The worship of Cybele was the prevailing one; its rites, like those of Dionysos and Aphrodite, encouraged impurity.<p>The writer is described in words similar to those in <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>, as the one who hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; but there is a difference. There Christ was seen holding the stars in His right hand; here it is said He <span class= "ital">hath</span> the seven Spirits and also the seven stars. In this language it is difficult to overlook the unhesitating way in which Christ is spoken of as owning or possessing that Holy Spirit who alone can make angels of His Church to shine as stars. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>). His promise is, "I will send the Comforter unto you" (<a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>), as possessing all power in heaven and earth. "He is able," to use the language of Professor Plumptre, "to bring together the gifts of life, and the ministry for which those gifts are needed. If those who minister are without gifts; it is because they have not asked for them." This the angel of the Sardian Church had not done; his faith and the faith of the Church around him had sunk into a superficial, though perhaps ostentatious, state. Here, then, lies the appropriateness of the description given of Christ, as the source of life and light to His Church.<p><span class= "bld">A name that thou livest.</span>--It is only needful to mention, and to dismiss the fanciful conjecture, that the name of the angel was Zosimos, or some parallel name, signifying life-bearing or living. It is the reputation for piety possessed by the Church of Sardis which is referred to. Living with the credit of superior piety, it was easy to grow satisfied with the reputation, and to forget to keep open the channels through which grace and life could flow, and to fail to realise that the adoption of habits of life higher than those around them, or those who lived before them, was no guarantee of real spiritual life; for "the real virtues of one age become the spurious ones of the next . . . The belief of the Pharisees, the religious practice of the Pharisees, was an improvement upon the life of the sensual and idolatrous Jews whom the prophets denounced. But those who used both the doctrinal and moral improvements as the fulcrum of a selfish power and earthly rank, were the same men after all as their fathers, only accommodated to a new age" (Mozley). Self-satisfaction, which springs up when a certain reputation has been acquired, is the very road to self-deception. The remedy is progress--forgetting the things behind, lest looking with complacency upon the past, moral and spiritual stagnation should set in, and spiritual death should follow. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistle to the Church at Sardis.</span> This Church is one of the two which receives unmixed reproof. Smyrna and Philadelphia receive no blame; Sardis and Laodicea receive no praise. Sardis lies almost due south of Thyatira, on the road to Philadelphia, between the river Hermus and Mount Tmolus. It had been in turn Lydian, Persian, Greek, and Roman, and, like its last Lydian king, Croesus, had been celebrated for its wealth. The auriferous stream Pactolus, in summer almost dry, flowed through its marketplace; but its chief source of wealth was its trade. In A.D. "twelve famous cities of Asia fell by an earthquake in the night... The calamity fell most heavily on the people of Sardis, and it attracted to them the largest share of sympathy. The emperor [Tiberius] promised ten million sesterces (&pound;85,000), and remitted for five years all they paid to the exchequer" (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:47). A little later Sardis was one of the cities of Asia which claimed the honour of erecting a temple in honour of Tiberius, but the preference was given to Smyrna ('Ann.,' 4:55, 56). Of the inscriptions which have been,discovered at Sardis, nearly all are of the Roman period. Cybele, or Cybebe, was the chief divinity of Sardis; but no reference to this nor to any of the special features of the city can be traced in the epistle. In the second century, Melito, Bishop of Sardis, held a very prominent place among Asiatic Christians, both in personal influence and in literary work. Among his numerous writings was one on the Apocalypse of St. John. The prosporous and luxurious capital of Lydia is now represented by a few huts and a collection of ruins buried deep in rubbish. It still retains its ancient name in the form <span class="accented">Sart.</span> The Church in Sardis has no Nicolaitans, no Balaam, no Jezebel. But there is worse evil than the presence of what is morally and doctrinally corrupt. The numbness of spiritual torpor and death is more hopeless than unwise toleration. The Church in Sardis, scarcely out of its infancy, has already the signs of an effete and moribund faith; and it is possible that this deadness was a result of the absence of internal enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath the seven Spirits of God</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:4, 16, 20; but observe that this designation of Christ does not occur in the opening vision). In <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> the Lamb is seen "having seven horns and seven eyes, <span class="accented">which are the seven Spirits</span> of God." The seven Spirits being the Holy Spirit in his sevenfold activity, it is manifest (as Trench observes) that this passage is of importance in reference to the doctrine of the double procession. The Son hath the Spirit, not as One who receives it from the Father, but as One who can impart it to men. As man he received it; as God he gives it. And a Church sunk in spiritual deadness specially needs such a gift. Hence the repetition about having the seven stars, which appears also in the address to the Church in Ephesus (<a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>). Note, however, that here we have <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which would not have been appropriate to express the Son's possession of the Spirit. It is he who holds in his hand the angels of the Church that also has the Spirit wherewith to quicken them. Those that are alive owe their life and growth to him. Those that are dying or dead may be restored to life by him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead</span>. This, again, is thoroughly in the style of the Fourth Gospel. St. John frequently states some gracious fact, and in immediate sequence gives the very opposite of what might have been expected to result from it. "Thou hast a reputation for life, and (instead of being full of vigour and growth) thou art a corpse." This has been called "the tragic tone" in St. John (comp. <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5, 10, 11</a>; <a href="/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11, 19, 32</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 40</a>; <a href="/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36, 43</a>, etc.). In all these cases the contrast is introduced by a simple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, which may be rendered "and yet;" but the simple "and" is more forcible. Beware of the unworthy literalism which suggests that the Bishop of Sardis bore a name which implied life, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Zosimus, or Vitalis. As already stated (notes on Revelation 1:20), it is improbable that "the angel" means the bishop. And in any case "name" is here used in the common sense of character or reputation. Comp. Herod., 7:138, where the historian says that Xerxes' expedition <span class="accented">had the name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>) of being directed against Athens, but was really a menace to the whole of Greece. We have very similar uses of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a> and <a href="/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>. The Church in Sardis had a name for Christianity, but there was no Christianity in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
