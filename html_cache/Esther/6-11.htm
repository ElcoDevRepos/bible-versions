This reversal highlights the theme of divine providence and justice. The robe and horse symbolize royal favor and honor, often reserved for those in high esteem, reflecting the customs of the Persian Empire where such public displays were common.<p><b>arrayed Mordecai</b><br>Mordecai, previously in sackcloth and ashes, is now clothed in royal garments. This transformation signifies a shift from mourning to exaltation, reminiscent of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>). It underscores the biblical principle that God exalts the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><b>and paraded him through the city square</b><br>The city square, a central place for public gatherings, ensures that Mordecai's honor is witnessed by many, contrasting with Haman's earlier secretive plotting.

It echoes the biblical motif of God honoring those who are faithful to Him (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).

Various thoughts were mingled there. Self-reproach, perhaps, that he had so thoughtlessly been the cause of the present display, bitter hatred of his rival now multiplied a thousandfold, and the evident knowledge that the game was played out, and that he was ruined. The more subtle the brain, the more truly must he have known this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then took Haman the apparel</span>. It was impossible for Haman to excuse himself; there was no ground on which he could decline the office thrust upon him. Reluctantly, without a word, he performed the king's bidding. HAMAN RETURNS HOME. DESPONDENCY OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS (<a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12-14</a>). There was as yet no real reason for Haman to feel depressed, or to regard himself as having lost favour with the king. He had been made an instrument in another man's honour, and had suffered a disappointment; but otherwise he was situated as on the day preceding, when he "went forth" from the palace "joyful and with a glad heart" (<a href="/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9</a>). But he seems to have had a presentiment of impending calamity. All had as yet gone so well with him that the first vexation seemed like a turn in the tide, ominous of coming evil. And the fear of his own heart found an echo in the hearts of his wife and friends. Among the last were some who had the reputation of being "wise men" - perhaps Magians, acquainted with arts from which it was supposed they could divine the future. These persons ventured on a prediction. "If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely (or utterly) fall before him." With this evil presage ringing in his ears, Haman quitted his house, and accompanied the palace eunuchs who had been sent to conduct him to Esther's second banquet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Haman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2001.htm">Strong's 2001: </a> </span><span class="str2">Haman -- to rage, be turbulent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
