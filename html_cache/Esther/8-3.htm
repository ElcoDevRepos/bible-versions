In the Persian court, approaching the king without being summoned could result in death, as seen earlier in <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>. Esther's persistence underscores her commitment to her people and her role as an intercessor, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>She fell at his feet weeping</b><br>This act of falling at the king's feet signifies humility and desperation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such a gesture was a sign of deep respect and earnest supplication. Esther's weeping reflects the gravity of the situation and her genuine concern for her people, reminiscent of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><b>and begged him to revoke the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite,</b><br>Haman's plot was not just a personal vendetta but a continuation of the ancient enmity between the Israelites and the Amalekites, of whom Agag was a king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>). This historical context emphasizes the spiritual battle between God's people and their adversaries. Esther's plea to revoke the decree highlights the theme of divine justice and reversal of evil plans, akin to God's ultimate victory over sin and death.<p><b>which he had devised against the Jews.</b><br>The Jews, God's chosen people, faced annihilation due to Haman's scheme. This reflects the recurring biblical theme of the survival and protection of the Jewish people despite numerous attempts to destroy them, as seen throughout history.

Her tears echo those of the penitent woman at Jesus&#8217; feet (<a href="/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>).

She has seen the condemnation of the foe of her race, and the exaltation of her kinsman to his office. But the royal edict sent out against the Jews still remains valid, and being a written decree, sealed with the king's seal, is supposed to be beyond the possibility of alteration. It was not, therefore, a case where Mordecai's newly-acquired dignity would authorise him to interfere, and therefore Esther, who, now that the ice is once broken, becomes more courageous, makes a fresh appeal to the king to do what theoretically was beyond the king's power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Esther spake yet again before the king</span>.
