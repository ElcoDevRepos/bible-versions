In the Persian Empire, Jews were a minority and often faced prejudice. By not revealing her heritage, Esther avoids potential discrimination and positions herself to later act on behalf of her people. This secrecy is reminiscent of other biblical figures who concealed their identity for a greater purpose, such as Joseph in Egypt. The theme of hidden identity also foreshadows the eventual revelation and deliverance of the Jewish people.<p><b>because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so</b><br>Mordecai's instruction to Esther highlights his wisdom and understanding of the political climate. As a Jew living in exile, Mordecai is aware of the potential dangers and prejudices that could arise if Esther's Jewish identity were known. His guidance reflects a protective and strategic approach, ensuring Esther's safety and influence within the royal court. This instruction also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Esther's hidden identity becomes crucial in the deliverance of the Jews. Mordecai's role as a guardian and advisor is pivotal, paralleling the protective and guiding nature of God over His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther (Hadassah)</a></b><br>A Jewish orphan raised by her cousin Mordecai, Esther becomes queen of Persia.
