In the cultural context of ancient Persia, public displays of anger could be seen as a loss of control, which might undermine one's authority or position. Haman's restraint here is a calculated move, as he plans to deal with Mordecai in a more strategic manner. This moment of self-control is temporary and contrasts with his later actions, which are driven by pride and hatred. The narrative sets up a tension between Haman's public persona and his private intentions, reflecting the broader theme of hidden motives and divine justice found throughout the Book of Esther.<p><b>And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh,</b><br>Haman's reliance on his friends and wife Zeresh for counsel is indicative of the social and familial structures of the time, where decisions were often made in consultation with close associates and family members. Zeresh, mentioned here, plays a significant role in advising Haman, which is consistent with the influence women could wield in domestic and political matters in ancient Persia. This gathering of friends and family also underscores the communal nature of decision-making in the ancient world. The advice Haman receives from Zeresh and his friends later in the narrative leads to the construction of the gallows for Mordecai, which ultimately becomes a pivotal point in the story. This scene foreshadows the reversal of fortunes that is a key theme in Esther, as Haman's plans for Mordecai ultimately lead to his own downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, Haman is the antagonist in the Book of Esther.

Moments earlier Haman burned with rage because Mordecai refused to bow (<a href="/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9</a>). Yet, rather than explode in public, he chooses a different response.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights this sober pause before sin: Cain had one in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5&#8211;7</a>; Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8&#8211;9</a>.

Both men retreat to nurse wounded pride.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> describes the restless wicked as &#8220;the tossing sea.&#8221; Haman&#8217;s house will soon mirror that turmoil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh,</b><p>&#8220;And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh,&#8221; (<a href="/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10</a>b)<p>&#8226; Instead of seeking wise counsel (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>), Haman gathers a cheering section that will feed his ego.<p>&#8226; The scene parallels <a href="/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a>, where Amnon&#8217;s friend Jonadab helps him plan sin.

Haman pauses, masks his rage, retreats to the privacy of home, and summons accomplices. What seems like self-control is actually calculated wickedness. The verse warns that restraint without repentance merely buys time for sin to mature, yet reminds us through the broader narrative that God remains sovereign, turning even the plots of proud men to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Zeresh.</span>--A name probably derived from an old Persian word for "gold."

But he did not "refrain his <span class="accented">heart."</span> He allowed the affront that he had received to remain in his mind and rankle there. It poisoned his happiness, marred all his enjoyment, filled him with hatred and rage. When he came home, he sent and called for his friends. It was not so much to be partners in his joy that Haman called his friends around him as to be companions in his grief. It is true that his speech to them was chiefly occupied with boasts; but the true intention of the discourse is seen in its close - "All this availeth me nothing," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless, Haman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2001.htm">Strong's 2001: </a> </span><span class="str2">Haman -- to rage, be turbulent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">restrained himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;&#8217;ap&#183;paq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_662.htm">Strong's 662: </a> </span><span class="str2">To contain, abstain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">home.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">And calling for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his friends</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_157.htm">Strong's 157: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have affection f</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Zeresh,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ze&#183;re&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2238.htm">Strong's 2238: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zeresh -- wife of Haman</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/esther/5-10.htm">Esther 5:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/esther/5-10.htm">OT History: Esther 5:10 Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home (Est Esth.
