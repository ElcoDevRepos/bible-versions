His name suggests a connection to the Babylonian god Marduk, reflecting the cultural assimilation of Jews in exile. Hadassah, meaning "myrtle," is Esther's Hebrew name, while Esther is derived from the Persian word for "star," possibly linked to the goddess Ishtar. This duality of names highlights the tension between Jewish identity and Persian culture. Mordecai's relationship to Esther as her cousin and guardian underscores the importance of family and kinship in Jewish tradition, especially during the diaspora.<p><b>because she did not have a father or mother</b><br>Esther's orphaned status is crucial to her story, as it sets the stage for her adoption by Mordecai. Orphanhood in ancient times often left individuals vulnerable, but it also allowed for divine providence to work through unexpected means. Esther's lack of parents emphasizes God's sovereignty in using unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes. This theme of divine orchestration is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as Joseph's rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>The young woman was lovely in form and appearance</b><br>Esther's beauty is a key factor in her selection as queen, yet the narrative suggests that her inner qualities are equally significant. The emphasis on physical beauty reflects the cultural values of the Persian Empire, where appearance could determine one's fate. However, Esther's story ultimately reveals that true beauty lies in courage, wisdom, and faithfulness. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearance.<p><b>and when her father and mother had died, Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter</b><br>Mordecai's adoption of Esther demonstrates the Jewish value of caring for orphans and the vulnerable, as commanded in the Torah (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>). This act of kindness and responsibility foreshadows the protective role Mordecai will play throughout the narrative. His guardianship also prefigures the concept of spiritual adoption found in the New Testament, where believers are adopted into God's family through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>). Mordecai's actions reflect God's care and provision for His people, even in exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew from the tribe of Benjamin, living in Susa, who took in his cousin Esther as his own daughter after her parents died.

His decision to nurture Hadassah highlights God&#8217;s quiet providence working through ordinary obedience (see <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). Like Jehoiada guiding young King Joash (<a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2-3</a>), Mordecai&#8217;s steady care becomes the hinge on which Israel&#8217;s future safety will swing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughter of his uncle</b><p>Esther is Mordecai&#8217;s cousin, yet he treats her as immediate family. Scripture repeatedly calls relatives to protect one another&#8212;&#8220;If anyone does not provide for his own&#8230; he has denied the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). <a href="/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a> shows inheritance laws flowing to the nearest kinsman; here, responsibility flows the same way, underscoring God&#8217;s design for family solidarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because she did not have a father or mother</b><p>Esther is an orphan, one of the most vulnerable categories in biblical law. The Lord &#8220;executes justice for the fatherless&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>) and is &#8220;a Father to the fatherless&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). Mordecai mirrors that divine heart, reflecting the call in <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> to care for orphans. His watchfulness becomes a human illustration of God&#8217;s covenant love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The young woman was lovely in form and appearance</b><p>Scripture notes Esther&#8217;s physical beauty (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a> on Rebekah), a detail that explains why the Persian court notices her. Yet outer beauty alone never secures God&#8217;s favor&#8212;&#8220;man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Esther&#8217;s humility and courage will soon prove that inner character matters most (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when her father and mother had died</b><p>The verse pauses on loss. Orphanhood is not theoretical; it is personal grief. <a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a> reassures, &#8220;Even if my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me&#8221;. Esther&#8217;s sorrow becomes the backdrop against which God&#8217;s comfort and purpose shine.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter</b><p>Mordecai&#8217;s adoption of Esther pictures the gospel pattern: choosing, welcoming, and granting full family rights (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>). Practical expressions:<p>&#8226; Legal protection under Persian law<p>&#8226; Daily provision&#8212;food, shelter, instruction<p>&#8226; Spiritual guidance in covenant faith, preparing her to stand for her people<p>Much like Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter adopting Moses (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>), Mordecai&#8217;s action positions Esther exactly where God will use her to rescue the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a> reveals a faithful guardian, a vulnerable orphan, and a sovereign God orchestrating every detail. Mordecai&#8217;s obedient care fulfills biblical commands toward family and the fatherless, while Esther&#8217;s God-given beauty and humble spirit set the stage for her royal appointment.
