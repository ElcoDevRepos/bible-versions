In the context of Persian royal customs, the garden was often a place for reflection and decision-making. The king's return marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting the urgency and gravity of the situation. This setting underscores the tension and impending justice about to unfold.<p><b>Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining</b><br>In ancient Persian culture, reclining on couches during banquets was customary. Haman's action of falling on the couch can be seen as a desperate plea for mercy. However, it is also culturally inappropriate, as it breaches the decorum expected in the presence of the queen. This act is misinterpreted by the king, leading to Haman's downfall. The irony here is profound, as Haman, who sought to destroy the Jews, finds himself in a position of vulnerability before a Jewish queen.<p><b>The king exclaimed, &#8220;Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?&#8221;</b><br>The king's exclamation reflects his immediate anger and suspicion. In the Persian court, any perceived threat to the queen was a serious offense. The king's rhetorical question suggests an accusation of impropriety or assault, which would have been considered a grave crime. This moment highlights the theme of divine justice, as Haman's schemes against Esther and her people are turned against him.<p><b>As soon as the words had left the king&#8217;s mouth, they covered Haman&#8217;s face</b><br>Covering Haman's face is a symbolic act indicating his impending execution. In Persian culture, this act signified that the person was no longer worthy to see the king or be seen by him. It marks the finality of Haman's fate and the swift execution of justice. This moment can be seen as a type of divine retribution, where Haman's plans are thwarted, and justice is served. The covering of the face also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God's presence for those who oppose His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who is hosting the banquet.

Haman had obviously thrown himself at the queen's feet to ask for mercy. The king on his return was evidently full of wrath against Haman, and though he was for the time God's instrument in averting Haman's wicked design, his own base and worthless character is none the less conspicuous. The attempted massacre had been authorised with the full knowledge and consent of the king, who yet ignores utterly his own share of the responsibility. Great and noble ends are at times brought about by the instrumentality of unholy men, blind instruments in a purpose whose end they understand not. What greater blessing, for example, did God vouchsafe to England than the Reformation, whose foremost agent was a bloody and unholy king?<p><span class= "bld">Will</span> <span class= "bld">he force. . . .</span>--Ahasuerus must have known perfectly well that Haman's position was that of a suppliant; his words do but indicate his utter anger, as the attendants clearly perceive, for they immediately covered Haman's face--he must not see the king's face again.
