The presence of the king and his princes indicates a formal and authoritative setting, where decisions of great importance are made. The Persian Empire was vast, and the king's court was a place of significant political power. The gathering of the princes suggests a council of advisors, reflecting the hierarchical structure of the empire. This setting underscores the gravity of the situation being addressed.<p><b>Memucan replied</b><br>Memucan is one of the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king's presence and were considered wise men of the kingdom. His role as a counselor highlights the importance of wisdom and counsel in leadership, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the value of guidance in achieving success. Memucan's response is pivotal, as it sets the course for the events that follow in the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king</b><br>This accusation against Queen Vashti reflects the cultural expectations of the time, where the king's authority was absolute, and any defiance was seen as a serious offense. Vashti's refusal to appear before the king is interpreted as a personal affront to his authority. This situation illustrates the patriarchal nature of ancient Persian society, where the king's word was law, and the queen's role was largely ceremonial and submissive.<p><b>but all the princes and the peoples in all the provinces of King Xerxes</b><br>Memucan expands the scope of Vashti's perceived wrongdoing to include not just the king but also the entire empire. This hyperbolic statement suggests that her actions could set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to widespread insubordination among women throughout the provinces. The mention of "all the provinces" highlights the vastness of Xerxes' empire, which stretched from India to Ethiopia, encompassing diverse cultures and peoples. This reflects the interconnectedness of the empire and the potential impact of royal actions on its stability. The concern for order and respect within the family unit is a theme that resonates with biblical teachings on authority and submission, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Such openness underscores that the matter is not private.<p>&#8226; Public counsel is a biblical pattern when an issue affects the nation (<a href="/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5-8</a>; <a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6-12</a>). Memucan&#8217;s audience signals the weight of Vashti&#8217;s actions&#8212;her refusal is a national concern, not a domestic spat.<p>&#8226; Scripture stresses the value of many witnesses in judgments (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). By addressing the court, Memucan ensures transparency and accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Memucan replied</b><p>&#8226; As one of seven trusted advisors (<a href="/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>), Memucan represents established authority. God often works through designated counselors (<a href="/genesis/41-37.htm">Genesis 41:37-40</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46-49</a>).<p>&#8226; His reply illustrates the duty of godly leaders to speak truth to power, even when difficult (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>; <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Memucan does not flatter; he assesses the situation soberly, modeling <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5-6</a>&#8212;&#8220;Better an open rebuke than hidden love.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;wronged&#8221; points to rebellion against God-ordained authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). By rejecting the king&#8217;s lawful summons, Vashti dishonors Xerxes and the marital order reflected in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>.<p>&#8226; The Bible records similar acts of individual defiance that threatened larger stability&#8212;Michal&#8217;s contempt for David (<a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16-23</a>) and Miriam&#8217;s challenge to Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1-10</a>).

If Vashti&#8217;s defiance goes unchecked, wives across Persia may imitate her, fracturing households and society.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all the provinces&#8221; reminds readers of Xerxes&#8217; vast empire (<a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). A single act in the palace can influence 127 provinces&#8212;just as one person&#8217;s faithfulness can bless many (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this social dynamic: &#8220;A little leaven works through the whole batch&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). Tolerated insubordination spreads.<p>&#8226; Memucan seeks preventive wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>). Addressing Vashti&#8217;s offense guards the moral order God established for families and nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a> reveals more than court intrigue; it illustrates how private rebellion affects public life. Speaking before king and princes, Memucan courageously identifies Vashti&#8217;s refusal as a sin against established authority with far-reaching impact. Scripture consistently affirms that leaders&#8217; actions set patterns for society, and unchecked defiance can erode God-ordained structures. Therefore the verse calls readers to honor rightful authority, recognize the communal consequences of personal choices, and uphold godly order for the good of all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Answered before the king.</span>--Memuean, like a true courtier, gives palatable advice to his master, by counsel which is the true echo of the king's angry question.<p><span class= "bld">Done wrong.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">dealt unfairly.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Memucan answered</span>. We gather from Memucan's reply that the Persian law had provided no penalty for the case in hand - had, in fact, not contemplated it. He first argues the matter on general grounds of morality (ver. 16) and expediency (vers. 17, 18), and then proposes the enactment of a new law - a <span class="accented">privilegium -</span> assigning Vashti a special punishment for her contempt of the king's order. The "<span class="accented">decree"</span> (ver. 20) would not have been necessary had there already existed a law on the point. <span class="cmt_word">Vashti, the queen, hath not done wrong to the king only</span>. With the servility to be expected in an Oriental and a courtier, Memucan throws himself wholly on the king's side - insinuates no word of blame against his royal master, on whom in justice the whole blame rested; but sets himself to make the worst he can of Vashti's conduct, which (he says) was a wrong not to Ahasuerus only, but to the whole male population of the empire, the princes included, who must expect their wives to throw off all subjection, in imitation of the queen's example, if her conduct were allowed to go unpunished. As such a condition of things would be intolerable, the king is urged to disgrace her publicly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And in the presence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
