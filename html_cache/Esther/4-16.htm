Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, was a significant city where many Jews lived in exile. The call to assemble indicates a collective action, emphasizing unity and solidarity among the Jewish community. This gathering for a common purpose reflects the biblical principle of corporate prayer and fasting seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15-16</a>, where the people are called to gather for a sacred assembly.<p><b>and fast for me</b><br>Fasting in the Bible is often associated with seeking God's favor or intervention in dire situations. Esther's request for fasting underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for divine intervention. Fasting is a spiritual discipline that involves humility and repentance, as seen in other biblical accounts like <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>. It is a way to express dependence on God and seek His guidance and protection.<p><b>Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day</b><br>The specific duration of three days and nights for fasting is significant, as it represents a complete period of time dedicated to seeking God's help. This mirrors other biblical instances where three days are pivotal, such as Jonah in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection after three days (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The total abstinence from food and drink indicates the severity of the situation and the depth of commitment required.<p><b>and I and my maidens will fast as you do</b><br>Esther's participation in the fast, along with her maidens, demonstrates her leadership and solidarity with her people. It shows her willingness to humble herself and seek God's favor alongside the Jewish community. This act of unity and shared purpose is reminiscent of other biblical leaders who led by example, such as Moses and Nehemiah.<p><b>After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law</b><br>Esther's decision to approach the king without being summoned is a courageous act that risks her life. The Persian law prohibited anyone from approaching the king unsummoned, under penalty of death, unless the king extended his golden scepter (<a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>). This act of bravery is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting themes of faith, courage, and divine providence. It parallels the boldness of other biblical figures who acted in faith despite personal risk, such as Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6).<p><b>And if I perish, I perish!</b><br>This statement reflects Esther's resolve and willingness to sacrifice her life for the sake of her people. It is an expression of faith and submission to God's will, regardless of the outcome. This echoes the sentiments of other biblical figures who faced potential martyrdom, such as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who trusted God even if He did not deliver them from the fiery furnace (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17-18</a>). Esther's words foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who willingly laid down His life for the salvation of others (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia who is faced with the challenge of saving her people from destruction.
