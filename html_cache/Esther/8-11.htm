The king's letters were sent throughout the Persian Empire, which was vast, stretching from India to Ethiopia. This demonstrates the extensive reach of the Persian administration and the importance of written decrees in maintaining order across such a large territory. The use of letters signifies the formal and legal nature of the decree, ensuring that it was recognized and enforced throughout the empire.<p><b>the right to assemble and defend themselves</b><br>The right to assemble was crucial for the Jews, as it allowed them to organize and prepare for their defense. This was a significant shift from their previous position of vulnerability. The ability to defend themselves was a matter of survival, as the earlier decree had left them exposed to attack. This self-defense was not just a physical necessity but also a moral and legal right granted by the king, reflecting a change in their status within the empire.<p><b>to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province hostile to them</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the threat against the Jews and the comprehensive nature of their authorized response. The language mirrors that of the original decree against them, emphasizing the complete reversal of their fortunes. The terms "destroy, kill, and annihilate" indicate the seriousness of the situation and the extent to which the Jews were permitted to go in defending themselves. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and retribution, where the punishment matches the intended harm.<p><b>including women and children</b><br>The inclusion of women and children in the decree highlights the totality of the threat faced by the Jews. In ancient warfare, entire families could be targeted, and this provision ensured that the Jews could protect all members of their community. This aspect of the decree also reflects the harsh realities of ancient conflicts, where non-combatants were often caught in the crossfire. It underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for comprehensive protection.<p><b>and to plunder their possessions</b><br>The permission to plunder the possessions of their enemies was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving as both a deterrent and a means of recompense for the victors. For the Jews, this provision not only allowed them to defend themselves but also to gain materially from their victory, which could help to restore what they had lost or been threatened with losing. This aspect of the decree aligns with the biblical theme of divine justice, where the righteous are ultimately rewarded and the wicked are punished.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia who played a crucial role in saving her people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who became a prominent figure in the Persian court and was instrumental in the Jews' deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the edict allowing the Jews to defend themselves.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to destroy the Jews, leading to the need for this edict.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire, where much of the account unfolds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in the reversal of the Jews' fate.

The Jews have sometimes been spoken of as the aggressors on the actual 13th of Adar, but there is no evidence to support this view. The edict clearly only allowed them to stand on the defensive.
