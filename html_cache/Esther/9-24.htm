The Amalekites were descendants of Esau and had a long-standing enmity with the Israelites, dating back to the time of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). The term "Agagite" may refer to a royal title or lineage, as Agag was a king of the Amalekites defeated by King Saul (1 Samuel 15). This connection underscores the historical animosity and sets the stage for Haman's actions against the Jews.<p><b>the enemy of all the Jews</b><br>Haman's enmity is not just personal but extends to all Jews, reflecting a deep-seated hatred. This phrase highlights the collective threat faced by the Jewish people, reminiscent of other biblical figures who opposed God's chosen people. The narrative of Esther emphasizes the theme of divine protection and deliverance for the Jewish nation, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the Exodus.<p><b>had plotted against the Jews to destroy them</b><br>Haman's plot to annihilate the Jews is a central theme in the Book of Esther. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's people faced existential threats, such as Pharaoh's decree against Hebrew infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) and later, Herod's massacre of the innocents (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>). The narrative underscores the providence of God in preserving His people against seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>and had cast the Pur (that is, the lot)</b><br>The casting of lots, or "Pur," was a common practice in the ancient Near East to make decisions or determine fate. In this context, it was used by Haman to select the date for the planned destruction of the Jews. The use of lots is significant in biblical history, often seen as a means by which God reveals His will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The irony in Esther is that what was intended for evil becomes a means of deliverance, as the festival of Purim commemorates the Jews' survival and victory.<p><b>to crush and destroy them</b><br>The language of "crush and destroy" emphasizes the totality of Haman's intended genocide. This echoes the language of other biblical adversaries who sought to obliterate Israel, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians. The narrative of Esther serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, ensuring the survival and continuity of His covenant people despite the plans of their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist in the Book of Esther, identified as an Agagite, which connects him to the Amalekites, historical enemies of Israel.
