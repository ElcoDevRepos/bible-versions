The king, Ahasuerus, is seeking counsel or assistance, which is a common practice for Persian kings who often relied on their advisors for decision-making. The court refers to the area where officials and those seeking an audience with the king would wait. This setting highlights the structured hierarchy and protocol of the Persian Empire, where access to the king was controlled and required permission. The king's inquiry sets the stage for a dramatic reversal of fortunes, a theme prevalent throughout the book.<p><b>Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace</b><br>Haman's presence in the outer court signifies his high status, as only those with significant influence could approach the king's court. The outer court was a place where officials and petitioners would wait, indicating Haman's eagerness to execute his plan against Mordecai. This moment is rich with irony, as Haman's intentions are about to be thwarted by divine providence. The timing of Haman's entrance is crucial, as it aligns with the king's sleepless night and the reading of the chronicles, which reminded the king of Mordecai's loyalty.<p><b>to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.</b><br>Haman's plot against Mordecai is a personal vendetta rooted in Mordecai's refusal to bow to him, which Haman perceived as a grave insult. The gallows, likely a tall wooden structure for impalement or hanging, symbolizes Haman's pride and malice. This method of execution was intended to be a public spectacle, reflecting the severe consequences of defying royal authority. The irony is profound, as the gallows prepared for Mordecai ultimately become the instrument of Haman's own demise. This reversal is a key element of the narrative, illustrating the biblical principle that those who plot evil will often fall into their own traps (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>). The story of Esther, including this moment, is seen as a type of Christ, where deliverance comes through unexpected means, and the plans of the wicked are overturned by divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

His immediate question, &#8220;Who is in the court?&#8221; shows a desire for quick action and counsel&#8212;common for Persian monarchs who kept officials near at hand (cf. <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>; 5:1).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is on full display: at the very moment the king seeks an adviser, the perfect (though unsuspecting) candidate is already standing by. Similar divine timing appears in <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a> (Joseph summoned at the exact right time) and <a href="/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a> (God directing events in a throne room setting).<p>&#8226; The scene highlights how human free choices unfold under God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration, echoing <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king asked.</b><p>&#8226; Xerxes (Ahasuerus) customarily issues orders through attendants, yet here he personally asks, underscoring urgency. Earlier he had relied on others for advice in chapter 1, but now he seeks immediate, face-to-face counsel&#8212;setting up an ironic twist (compare <a href="/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13</a> with 6:4).<p>&#8226; The narrative invites readers to notice the contrast between a powerful ruler seeking help and the unseen God silently directing every detail (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; This simple question will pivot the entire story; decisions made in moments of apparent routine can carry eternal weight (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>, where a king&#8217;s quick choice fulfills God&#8217;s plan).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Had just entered&#8221; stresses perfect timing: Haman&#8217;s arrival coincides exactly with the king&#8217;s need, illustrating <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> in historical form&#8212;God works all things together for good for His people.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;outer court&#8221; kept petitioners accessible yet controlled (<a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>). Haman stands poised to request lethal permission, unaware he is walking into judgment&#8212;much like Pharaoh pressing forward at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Moments earlier, Haman exulted in his apparent favor (<a href="/esther/5-11.htm">Esther 5:11-12</a>). Pride often positions a person on the edge of downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him</b><p>&#8226; Haman&#8217;s murderous intent is explicit: he seeks not merely to silence Mordecai but to display him publicly on a 75-foot structure (<a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>). This cruelty parallels the plots against Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-7.htm">Daniel 6:7-9</a>) and against Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The prepared gallows symbolize premeditated malice. Scripture teaches that traps set for the righteous often ensnare the wicked themselves (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>). <a href="/esther/7-9.htm">Esther 7:9-10</a> fulfills this principle when Haman is executed on the very gallows built for Mordecai.<p>&#8226; God turns the enemy&#8217;s weapon into the means of deliverance, foreshadowing the cross where Satan&#8217;s plan was upended (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/6-4.htm">Esther 6:4</a> captures the hinge of the book. The king&#8217;s simple inquiry and Haman&#8217;s perfectly timed entrance reveal the unseen hand of God, coordinating human plans to exalt the humble and bring down the proud. While Haman schemes death, God is already orchestrating reversal and rescue for His covenant people, demonstrating that no plot can thwart the purpose of the Almighty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Haman was</span> <span class= "bld">come.</span>--It being at length morning, Haman had come to the palace in due course, and was waiting in the outer court till the king should call for him.

Haman was so anxious to get the business on which he was bent despatched, that he had come perhaps even before daybreak, and was waiting in the outer court, to get, if possible, the first audience. This haste of his to effect Mordecai's destruction led to his being the person deputed to do him the highest honour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is in the court?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
