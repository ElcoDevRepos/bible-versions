This refers to the lots cast by Haman to determine the date for the annihilation of the Jews (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>). The casting of lots was a common practice in ancient cultures to make decisions or determine fate, and it highlights the theme of divine providence in the Book of Esther. Despite Haman's intentions, God orchestrated events to protect His people, turning a day of potential destruction into a time of celebration. The festival of Purim commemorates this deliverance and is celebrated annually by Jews worldwide. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, even when His presence is not overtly mentioned, as is the case in the Book of Esther.<p><b>Because of all the instructions in this letter,</b><br>The "letter" refers to the decree sent by Mordecai and Queen Esther to the Jewish people throughout the Persian Empire, instructing them to observe the days of Purim (<a href="/esther/9-20.htm">Esther 9:20-22</a>). This letter was crucial in establishing Purim as an official and perpetual celebration. The instructions included feasting, rejoicing, and giving gifts to one another and to the poor, emphasizing community and charity. This reflects the biblical principle of remembering and celebrating God's deliverance, as seen in other Jewish festivals like Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). The written decree ensured that the memory of God's intervention would be preserved for future generations.<p><b>and because of all they had seen and experienced,</b><br>The Jewish people had witnessed firsthand the miraculous reversal of their fortunes. They experienced the threat of annihilation and the subsequent deliverance orchestrated through Esther and Mordecai's courage and faith. This phrase underscores the importance of personal and communal memory in the life of faith. The experiences of the Jews in Persia serve as a testament to God's protection and justice. This mirrors other biblical narratives where God's people are called to remember His mighty acts, such as the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/4.htm">Joshua 4:1-7</a>). The celebration of Purim serves as a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of trusting in His providence, even in dire circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia who played a crucial role in saving her people from annihilation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who uncovered a plot against the Jews and was instrumental in their deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to destroy the Jews but was ultimately defeated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purim.htm">Purim</a></b><br>A Jewish festival established to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's plot.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire, where the events of Esther took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The account of Purim highlights God's control over history and events, even when He seems absent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_and_faith.htm">Courage and Faith</a></b><br>Esther's bravery in approaching the king teaches us to act in faith, trusting God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_fasting.htm">The Power of Prayer and Fasting</a></b><br>The Jews' response to their crisis with prayer and fasting is a model for seeking divine intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebrating_deliverance.htm">Celebrating Deliverance</a></b><br>Purim is a reminder to celebrate and remember God's deliverance in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_reversal.htm">Justice and Reversal</a></b><br>The account illustrates the theme of divine justice and the reversal of evil plans.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_9_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 9:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_26_Remember_God_s_deliverance.htm">How does Esther 9:26 emphasize the importance of remembering God's deliverance today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Purim_show_God_s_faithfulness.htm">What role does "Purim" play in understanding God's faithfulness in Esther 9:26?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spiritually_apply_Purim.htm">How can we apply the remembrance of "Purim" in our spiritual lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_26_and_biblical_deliverance_links.htm">How does Esther 9:26 connect with other biblical celebrations of God's deliverance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_s_faithfulness_today.htm">What practical steps can we take to commemorate God's faithfulness like in Esther 9:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Purim_s_significance_in_Esther_9_26.htm">What is the significance of Purim as described in Esther 9:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_26_God_s_role_in_Jewish_history.htm">How does Esther 9:26 reflect God's providence in Jewish history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Purim_s_name_key_in_Esther_9_26.htm">Why is the naming of Purim important in Esther 9:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_esther_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Esther 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_aren't_esther's_banquets_in_records.htm">Esther 5:4&#8211;8 &#8211; Why are these banquets and intrigues not mentioned in any historical or archaeological records of Persia? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_feast_of_purim.htm">What is the Feast of Purim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_casting_lots_for_genocide_fit_persian_customs.htm">Esther 3:7 &#8211; Does the account of deciding genocide by casting lots match known Persian customs, and is there evidence to support it? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_esther_2_15_align_biblically.htm">How does Esther 2:15 align with other biblical traditions when it omits any mention of Jewish religious practice? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Esther 9:26 Mean</div><b>Therefore these days are called Purim,</b><p>The naming of the feast itself tells a story of deliverance that is meant to be remembered generation after generation.
