This day was the 13th of Adar, a date that had been set by Haman for the annihilation of the Jews. The reversal of this decree highlights the providence of God in protecting His people.<p><b>the number of those killed</b><br>The text indicates a significant victory for the Jews, as they were able to defend themselves effectively. The specific number of those killed is not mentioned in this verse, but it underscores the scale of the conflict and the seriousness of the threat against the Jewish people. This victory is a testament to the divine justice and protection afforded to the Jews.<p><b>in the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa was one of the major capitals of the Persian Empire, serving as a royal city where King Ahasuerus resided. The citadel was a fortified area within the city, often used for administrative and military purposes. The mention of Susa emphasizes the centrality of the events in the Persian Empire and the high stakes involved, as the conflict reached even the heart of the empire.<p><b>was reported to the king</b><br>The reporting of the number to the king indicates the importance of the event and the need for the king to be informed of the outcomes of the decree he had authorized. This reflects the administrative practices of the Persian Empire, where the king was kept apprised of significant developments. It also sets the stage for the king's subsequent actions and decisions regarding the Jews and their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who played a crucial role in saving her people from destruction.
