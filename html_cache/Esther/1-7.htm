Gold, often associated with royalty and divinity, reflects the grandeur of the Persian Empire. In biblical times, gold was a symbol of purity and value, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). The lavishness of the feast underscores the king's power and the empire's prosperity.<p><b>each with a different design</b><br>The unique designs of each goblet highlight the creativity and craftsmanship of the period. This diversity in design may also symbolize the vastness and multicultural nature of the Persian Empire, which spanned from India to Ethiopia, encompassing many peoples and cultures (<a href="/esther/1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). The individuality of each goblet could reflect the empire's diversity and the king's ability to unify various cultures under his rule.<p><b>and the royal wine flowed freely</b><br>The abundance of wine signifies the king's generosity and the celebratory nature of the feast. Wine in the Bible often symbolizes joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>). The free flow of wine at the banquet may also indicate the king's desire to display his wealth and ensure the satisfaction of his guests. This abundance contrasts with the biblical warnings against excess and drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p><b>according to the king&#8217;s bounty</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the king's wealth and his ability to provide lavishly for his guests. The king's bounty reflects his power and the resources at his disposal. In a broader biblical context, this can be contrasted with the divine provision and bounty of God, who provides for His people (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The king's generosity, while impressive, is temporal and earthly, whereas God's provision is eternal and spiritual.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Like Abraham&#8217;s generous meal for strangers (<a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6-8</a>) and Jesus&#8217; feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>), the verse underscores that true royalty expresses itself in lavish provision. For God&#8217;s people reading this narrative, it reminds us that the Lord&#8217;s own table is never meager (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;in an array of goblets of gold</b><p>Gold vessels point to unmatched splendor. Solomon&#8217;s court used only gold for drinking (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>), and Daniel records Belshazzar misusing sacred gold cups from the temple (<a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2-4</a>). By mentioning golden goblets here, Scripture shows that even the greatest earthly kingdom can only mimic heaven&#8217;s grandeur, where &#8220;the street of the city was pure gold&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>). The contrast elevates God&#8217;s glory above Persia&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;each with a different design</b><p>Diversity of pattern illustrates both wealth and artistic skill. It also hints at the king&#8217;s desire to impress every guest personally. Compare Joseph providing &#8220;changes of clothes&#8221; for his brothers (<a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>) and David distributing &#8220;a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins to each one&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>). Scripture often shows that thoughtful variety communicates honor; how much more does God tailor His gifts to His children (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and the royal wine flowed freely</b><p>Unlimited wine pictures overflowing joy (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>) and festivity (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7-11</a>). Yet <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-32</a> warns of excess. <a href="/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a> immediately notes drinking &#8220;without compulsion,&#8221; balancing liberty with restraint. The narrative sets the stage for later irony: a wine-emboldened king will make rash decrees (<a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10-22</a>), while God quietly works His redemptive plan. Wine can gladden the heart or expose folly&#8212;both truths stand in Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;according to the king&#8217;s bounty</b><p>Everything depends on the monarch&#8217;s generosity. &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness thereof&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>), so even Persia&#8217;s bounty ultimately traces back to God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). Human kings may showcase their riches, but only the Heavenly King sustains them (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>). Esther&#8217;s readers are meant to see that beneath Ahasuerus&#8217; openhandedness lies the greater providence of the Almighty, who will soon preserve His covenant people through Esther.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/1-7.htm">Esther 1:7</a> paints a vivid scene of extravagant hospitality to emphasize Persia&#8217;s power and opulence. Golden goblets, varied designs, free-flowing wine, and regal generosity create a backdrop against which God&#8217;s quiet sovereignty will shine. The verse reminds believers that all earthly splendor pales next to the Lord&#8217;s, that His provision is richer still, and that He rules over every banquet hall and throne room to accomplish His faithful purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">In vessels of gold.</span>--This shows the immense treasures in the hand of the Persian king, when the whole population of Susa could be thus accommodated.<p><span class= "bld">Royal wine.</span>--Perhaps wine of Helbon (<a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>); the original seems to imply more than merely wine from the royal cellars: as the king was feasting his people, it could hardly have been otherwise.<p><span class= "bld">State.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">hand.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They gave them drink in vessels of gold</span>. Drinking-vessels of gold were found in considerable numbers in the Persian camp near Plataea (Herod., 9:80) when the Greeks took it. They had been the property of Persian nobles.
