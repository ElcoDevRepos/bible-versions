The king's authority and Haman's high position as his advisor set the stage for the unfolding drama. Historically, the Persian Empire was vast, and the king's decisions had far-reaching implications. Haman's role as a high-ranking official underscores the gravity of the situation, as he had previously plotted to annihilate the Jewish people (<a href="/esther/3-6.htm">Esther 3:6-13</a>).<p><b>went to dine</b><br>Dining in the ancient Near East was not merely a meal but a significant social event, often used to discuss important matters or solidify alliances. The act of dining together suggests a level of intimacy and trust, which is ironic given Haman's hidden agenda against Esther's people. This setting provides Esther with the opportunity to reveal her true identity and plead for her people, demonstrating the providential timing and wisdom in her approach.<p><b>with Esther the queen</b><br>Esther's position as queen is crucial to the narrative. Her ascent from a Jewish orphan to queen of Persia is a testament to divine providence and favor. Esther's role as queen gives her unique access to the king, which she uses to intercede for her people. Her courage and strategic planning are reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted as mediators, such as Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 41) and Daniel in Babylon (Daniel 6). Esther's actions can also be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of His people (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
