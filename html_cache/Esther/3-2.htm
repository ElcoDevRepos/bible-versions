Bowing and paying homage were customary practices in ancient Near Eastern cultures, signifying respect and submission to authority. Haman, having been elevated to a high position by King Xerxes, was accorded such honor. This act of bowing was not merely a gesture of respect but also a recognition of Haman's authority and the king's decree. The practice of bowing to officials is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>, where Joseph is honored in Egypt.<p><b>because the king had commanded that this be done for him</b><br>The command from the king underscores the absolute power and authority of the Persian monarch, whose edicts were irrevocable and had to be obeyed without question. This reflects the hierarchical and autocratic nature of the Persian Empire, where the king's word was law. The king's command also highlights the political dynamics at play, as Haman's position was not just one of personal power but was backed by royal authority. This mirrors the decree in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a>, where King Nebuchadnezzar commands all to worship the golden image.<p><b>But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage</b><br>Mordecai's refusal to bow to Haman is a pivotal moment in the narrative, reflecting his steadfastness and commitment to his faith and principles. This act of defiance can be seen as a refusal to give divine honor to a man, which aligns with the Jewish prohibition against idolatry. Mordecai's actions echo those of Daniel and his friends, who refused to worship the king's image (<a href="/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a>). This resistance sets the stage for the conflict that follows and highlights the theme of faithfulness to God over compliance with human authority. Mordecai's stance can be seen as a type of Christ, who also stood firm in the face of opposition and did not conform to worldly demands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, appointed by King Xerxes.

Whether Mordecai also rebelled against the ignominious character of the obeisance, we cannot say.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the king's servants</span>.

No reason is assigned for this order, which was certainly unusual, since the prostration of an inferior before a superior was a general rule (Herod., 1:134). Perhaps Haman had been elevated from a very low position, and the king therefore thought a special order requisite. <span class="cmt_word">Mordecai bowed not</span>. Greeks occasionally refused to prostrate themselves before the Great King himself, saying that it was not their custom to worship men (Herod., 7:136; Plut., 'Vit. Artax.,' &sect; 22; Arrian., 'Exp. Alex.,' 4:10-12, etc.). Mordecai seems to have had the same feeling. Prostration was, he thought, an act of worship, and it was not proper to worship any one excepting God (see <a href="/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
