Mordecai has informed Esther of Haman's plot to annihilate the Jews, and Esther initially hesitates to approach the king due to the risk involved.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* In ancient Persia, communication between the queen and others outside the palace often required intermediaries. This reflects the protocols and restrictions of the royal court, where direct access to the queen was limited.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The communication between Esther and Mordecai highlights the theme of intercession, which is seen throughout the Bible. Esther's role as an intercessor for her people parallels the role of Moses interceding for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and foreshadows the ultimate intercession of Christ for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* Esther's willingness to risk her life for her people can be seen as a type of Christ, who sacrificed Himself for the salvation of mankind. Her intercession is a precursor to the mediatory role of Jesus.<br><br>*Prophecy:* While not a direct prophecy, the deliverance of the Jews in Esther's story is a testament to God's providential care for His people, which is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, emphasizing God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, who is faced with the challenge of saving her people from a decree of destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who informs her of the plot against the Jews and urges her to intervene with the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plots to annihilate the Jews in the Persian Empire.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa (Shushan)</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire where the events of the Book of Esther take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who is manipulated by Haman into decreeing the destruction of the Jews.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br><a href="/esther/4-12.htm">Esther 4:12</a> reminds us of God's unseen hand in orchestrating events for His purposes.
