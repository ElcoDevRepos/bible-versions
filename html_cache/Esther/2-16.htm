The phrase "she was taken" suggests a lack of agency, reflecting the cultural norms of ancient Persia where women, especially those in the king's harem, had limited autonomy. This event is part of God's providential plan, as Esther's position would later be crucial for the deliverance of the Jewish people. The king, known historically as Xerxes I, ruled the Persian Empire from 486 to 465 BC, a vast empire stretching from India to Ethiopia.<p><b>in the royal palace</b><br>The royal palace in Susa (Shushan) was one of the capitals of the Persian Empire. Archaeological excavations have uncovered the grandeur of this palace, which included a large audience hall and luxurious living quarters. The setting emphasizes the opulence and power of the Persian monarchy, contrasting with Esther's humble Jewish origins. The palace serves as the backdrop for the unfolding drama of Esther's rise to queen and her subsequent influence.<p><b>in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth</b><br>The month of Tebeth corresponds to December-January in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it situates Esther's introduction to the king during the winter months, a period when the Persian court would have been in residence at Susa. The specific mention of the month underscores the historical accuracy and attention to detail in the narrative, grounding the story in a real historical context.<p><b>in the seventh year of his reign</b><br>The seventh year of Xerxes' reign would be around 479 BC. This timing is crucial as it follows Xerxes' failed invasion of Greece, which ended in 480 BC. The king's return to Susa and the subsequent search for a new queen may reflect a period of consolidation and reorganization within the empire. Esther's rise to queenship during this time highlights God's sovereignty in placing her in a position of influence at a critical juncture in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish orphan raised by her cousin Mordecai, Esther becomes queen of Persia.
