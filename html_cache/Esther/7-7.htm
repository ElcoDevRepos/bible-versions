In ancient Persian culture, banquets were significant social and political events, often involving heavy drinking. The king's reaction is immediate and intense, reflecting the gravity of Esther's revelation about Haman's plot. This moment underscores the king's authority and the seriousness of the accusations against Haman. The king's anger can be compared to other biblical instances where leaders react strongly to betrayal or injustice, such as King Saul's anger towards David.<p><b>and went to the palace garden</b><br>The palace garden serves as a place for the king to collect his thoughts away from the immediate chaos. Gardens in Persian palaces were often luxurious and symbolized peace and reflection. This setting contrasts with the tension inside the banquet hall. The garden may also symbolize a place of decision-making, as the king contemplates the fate of Haman. The use of a garden as a setting can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as the Garden of Gethsemane, where significant decisions and events unfold.<p><b>while Haman stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life</b><br>Haman's decision to stay and plead with Esther highlights his desperation and the reversal of his fortunes. In the cultural context, approaching the queen directly would have been a breach of protocol, indicating Haman's dire situation. This act of begging is a stark contrast to his previous arrogance and power. The narrative demonstrates the theme of divine justice and reversal, where the proud are humbled. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction.<p><b>for he realized that the king was planning a terrible fate for him</b><br>Haman's realization marks the climax of his downfall. The phrase indicates his awareness of the irreversible consequences of his actions. In the historical context, Persian kings had absolute power, and their decisions were final. Haman's fate is sealed by his own schemes, fulfilling the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. This moment also foreshadows the ultimate justice that will be served, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and justice prevailing over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intercedes for her people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who is unaware of Haman's plot against the Jews.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plots to destroy the Jews and is exposed by Esther.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>A private feast hosted by Esther for the king and Haman, where she reveals Haman's plot.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_palace_garden.htm">The Palace Garden</a></b><br>The location where King Ahasuerus retreats in anger after Esther's revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_injustice.htm">Courage in the Face of Injustice</a></b><br>Esther's bravery in confronting the king about Haman's plot teaches us to stand up for righteousness, even when it is risky.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing_and_providence.htm">Divine Timing and Providence</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in the timing of events, reminding us to trust His perfect plan and timing in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride_and_deceit.htm">The Consequences of Pride and Deceit</a></b><br>Haman's downfall is a stark reminder of the dangers of pride and plotting against God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_advocacy.htm">Intercession and Advocacy</a></b><br>Esther's role as an intercessor for her people encourages us to advocate for others in prayer and action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_influence.htm">The Power of Influence</a></b><br>Esther's influence over the king shows the impact one person can have when aligned with God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_7_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 7:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_7_7_God_s_providence_shown.htm">How does Esther 7:7 demonstrate God's providence in protecting His people?

Haman also rose from table, and standing near her, began pleading with Esther for his life, which he felt that she, and she alone, could save. <span class="cmt_word">Evil</span>, he saw, <span class="cmt_word">was determined against him by the king;</span> but a woman's heart might be more tender, and he might perhaps move the queen to allay the storm that she had raised, and induce the king to spare him. He therefore pleaded with all the earnestness in his power, and at last threw himself forward on the couch whore Esther reclined, seeking perhaps to grasp her feet or her garments, as is usual with suppliants in the East. At this crisis the king returned, and misconstruing Haman's action, or pretending to do so, exclaimed aloud, "Will he even force the queen with me in the house?" The terrible charge brought matters to a conclusion - it was taken as a call on the attendants to seize the culprit and execute him. <span class="cmt_word">They covered his face</span>, apparently, as that of a condemned man not worthy any more to see the light, according to a practice common among, the Romans (Liv., 1:26; Cic.
