The Persian custom involved a lengthy preparation period, emphasizing the importance of physical beauty and presentation in the royal court. This reflects the cultural values of the Persian Empire, where the king's favor was often sought through external appearances. The process also highlights the vulnerability and lack of agency of these women, who were essentially at the mercy of the king's desires.<p><b>she was given whatever she requested</b><br>This indicates a level of autonomy granted to the women, allowing them to choose items that might enhance their appeal to the king. It suggests a strategic element, as the women could select clothing, jewelry, or other items to make a favorable impression. This choice could reflect their personal tastes or advice from others, such as the eunuchs in charge. The freedom to request items also underscores the competitive nature of the selection process, as each woman sought to distinguish herself.<p><b>to take with her from the harem</b><br>The harem was a secluded part of the palace where the king's wives and concubines lived. It was a place of both privilege and confinement, as the women had access to luxury but were also isolated from the outside world. The harem's existence is well-documented in ancient Near Eastern cultures, serving as a symbol of the king's wealth and power. The mention of the harem highlights the controlled environment in which these women lived, emphasizing their role as part of the king's possessions.<p><b>to the king&#8217;s palace</b><br>The king's palace was the center of political power in the Persian Empire, a grand and opulent structure reflecting the king's authority and wealth. Archaeological findings at sites like Persepolis provide insight into the grandeur of such palaces, with their elaborate architecture and decorations. The movement from the harem to the palace signifies a transition from preparation to presentation, as the women entered the king's presence. This setting underscores the gravity of the moment, as the king's decision would determine their future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who becomes queen of Persia.
