In the Persian Empire, the king's word was law, reflecting the absolute power he wielded. Vashti's presence was intended to showcase her as part of the king's wealth and splendor. This event sets the stage for the unfolding drama in the Book of Esther, highlighting themes of power, authority, and the role of women in ancient Persia.<p><b>wearing her royal crown</b><br>The royal crown symbolizes Vashti's status and the honor bestowed upon her as queen. In ancient Persia, the crown was a sign of authority and dignity. The emphasis on the crown suggests that the king wanted to display not just Vashti's beauty but also her royal status, enhancing his own prestige. This request can be seen as a precursor to the later events where Esther, another queen, would play a pivotal role in the salvation of the Jewish people.<p><b>to display her beauty to the people and officials</b><br>This phrase underscores the cultural norms of the time, where women were often valued for their physical appearance. The king's desire to display Vashti's beauty reflects the objectification and commodification of women in ancient societies. It also highlights the contrast between Vashti's refusal to be objectified and Esther's later strategic use of her own beauty and wisdom to influence the king for a greater purpose.<p><b>For she was beautiful to behold</b><br>Vashti's beauty is noted as a significant attribute, which was likely a factor in her selection as queen. This emphasis on physical beauty is a recurring theme in the Book of Esther, where Esther's own beauty plays a crucial role in her rise to prominence. The narrative invites readers to consider the deeper qualities of character and courage that ultimately define true beauty and worth, as seen in Esther's later actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Vashti's "crown royal" was probably not very dissimilar. <span class="cmt_word">To show the princes and the people her beauty</span>. More than one Oriental monarch is reported to have desired to have his own opinion of his wife's beauty confirmed by the judgment of others. Candaules, king of Lydia, is said to have lost his crown and his life through imprudently indulging this desire (Herod., 1:8-12). So public an exposure, however, as that designed by Ahasuerus is not recorded of any other monarch, and would scarcely have been attempted by any one less extravagant in his conduct than Xerxes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
