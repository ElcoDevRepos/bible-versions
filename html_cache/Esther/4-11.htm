The Persian Empire, under King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), was known for its extensive bureaucracy and communication systems, which ensured that laws and decrees were well-known throughout the empire. This context emphasizes the gravity and universality of the law Esther refers to.<p><b>that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned</b><br>The inner court was a place of great significance and security, reserved for the king and those he invited. The law mentioned here underscores the absolute authority of the Persian king and the strict protocols of the royal court. This reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where approaching the king uninvited was seen as a severe breach of protocol and a potential threat to the king's safety.<p><b>that he be put to death</b><br>This severe penalty illustrates the absolute power of the king and the seriousness of court protocol. It also reflects the ancient Near Eastern view of kingship, where the king was often seen as a semi-divine figure whose presence was sacred. The death penalty for unsummoned approach served as a deterrent against potential threats and maintained the sanctity of the king's court.<p><b>Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live</b><br>The gold scepter symbolizes the king's authority and mercy. Extending it was a sign of favor and acceptance, allowing the person to approach without fear of death. This act of grace can be seen as a type of Christ, who extends mercy and grace to those who approach Him. The scepter's extension is a pivotal moment, representing the king's power to grant life or death.<p><b>But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days</b><br>Esther's statement reveals her precarious position and the risk involved in approaching the king. The thirty-day period suggests a possible waning of the king's favor or interest, adding to Esther's anxiety. This situation sets the stage for Esther's courageous decision to risk her life for her people, highlighting themes of faith, providence, and divine timing.

The policy is public, consistent, and unchangeable, much like the &#8220;laws of the Medes and Persians&#8221; mentioned in <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8&#8211;12</a>.<p>&#8226; Everyone&#8212;from the highest official to the most distant subject&#8212;recognizes the absolute authority of Xerxes. Compare this with <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, where earthly rulers wield real, God-ordained power.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the universality of the rule, echoing <a href="/esther/1-22.htm">Esther 1:22</a> where the king&#8217;s decrees were sent &#8220;to every province in its own script.&#8221; No one is exempt, not even the queen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned&#8212;that he be put to death.</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned&#8212;that he be put to death.&#8221; (4:11b)<p>&#8226; The single, unbending statute reveals both the glory and the danger of absolute monarchy. Life or death turned on protocol. See <a href="/genesis/43-5.htm">Genesis 43:5</a> where Joseph&#8217;s brothers note, &#8220;The man warned us solemnly, &#8216;You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The inner court symbolizes access to ultimate authority. <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> shows Isaiah undone in the presence of the heavenly King, stressing humanity&#8217;s unworthiness before sovereign power.<p>&#8226; The death penalty highlights the peril Esther faces, bringing weight to Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a> about fearing God more than those who can kill the body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live.</b><p>&#8220;Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live.&#8221; (4:11c)<p>&#8226; The gold scepter is a tangible sign of royal favor. In <a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a> the king&#8217;s act of extending it spares Esther and opens the way for her petition.<p>&#8226; This gesture prefigures the gracious invitation believers receive: &#8220;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). Access is granted not by protocol but by mercy.<p>&#8226; The contrast between certain death and granted life mirrors <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1&#8211;5</a>, where we move from death in sin to life through God&#8217;s rich mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days.</b><p>&#8220;But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days.&#8221; (4:11d)<p>&#8226; Esther&#8217;s access has lapsed; royal favor seems distant. This heightens the suspense and reveals her vulnerability. Compare <a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17&#8211;18</a>, where her favor had once been fresh, now apparently cooling.<p>&#8226; The delay forces Esther to weigh obedience to God&#8217;s providential purpose over personal safety, echoing <a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a> where Paul values faithfulness over life itself.<p>&#8226; Waiting thirty days without a summons may evoke the tension of <a href="/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1&#8211;2</a>: &#8220;How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever?&#8221; Yet God&#8217;s timing often sets the stage for His deliverance, as seen later in <a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a> when &#8220;the king could not sleep.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a> exposes the razor-edge balance between life and death in the Persian court, underscoring the gravity of Esther&#8217;s decision. The unbreakable law illustrates human authority at its fiercest, while the gold scepter foreshadows divine grace that grants undeserved access. Esther&#8217;s thirty-day exclusion magnifies the risk and sets the stage for God&#8217;s sovereign intervention. The verse challenges readers to trust God&#8217;s providence, approach Him on His terms, and, like Esther, embrace courageous obedience even when the cost is high.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">There is</span> one <span class= "bld">law of</span> <span class= "bld">his . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">one is his law,</span> that is, there is one unvarying rule for such.

How forcibly, after reading this verse, the contrast strikes us between the self-styled <span class= "ital">king of kings,</span> to enter into whose presence even as a suppliant for help and protection was to risk death, and the King of Kings, who has Himself instructed man to say, "Let us go into His tabernacle and fall low on our knees before His footstool."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the king's servants</span> seems to mean here "all the court," "all those in the immediate service of the king." <span class="cmt_word">The inner court</span>. The palace had, as it would seem, only two courts, the "outward court" of ch. 6:4, and the "inner court" of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">There is one law of his to put him to death</span>. Rather, "there is one law for him. 'Whoever he be, there is one and the same law regarding him - he must suffer death. Herodotus excepts six persons from the operation of this law (3:84, 118), but in making the exception shows the general rule to have been such as here represented. <span class="cmt_word">Except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre</span>. No other writer tells us of this custom, but it is in perfect harmony with Oriental habits and modes of thought. Some have objected that the king would not always have a golden sceptre by him; but the Persepolitan sculptures uniformly represent him with a long tapering staff in his hand, which is probably the "sceptre" (<span class="accented">sharbith</span>) of Esther. <span class="cmt_word">I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days</span>. The king s passion had cooled, and Esther now, like his other wives, waited her occasional summons to his presence. She had not been called for a whole month, and did not know when a summons might come. It would not do to trust to so mere a chance; and therefore, if she was to interpose on behalf of her nation, she must intrude on the king uninvited, and risk being put to death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the royal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1441;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
