The discovery of this record is a pivotal moment in the narrative, demonstrating God's providence and timing. The use of records is also seen in other parts of the Bible, such as the genealogies in Genesis and the chronicles of the kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>that Mordecai had exposed</b><br>Mordecai's loyalty to King Xerxes is emphasized here. His actions reflect the biblical principle of honoring authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>. Mordecai's exposure of the plot also sets the stage for his eventual elevation, illustrating the theme of divine justice and reward for righteousness.<p><b>Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs</b><br>Eunuchs were often trusted officials in ancient royal courts, responsible for various duties, including guarding the king. The mention of their names adds historical authenticity to the account. Eunuchs are also mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in the story of Daniel, who served in the Babylonian court.<p><b>who guarded the king&#8217;s entrance</b><br>This detail underscores the high level of trust and responsibility given to Bigthana and Teresh. The king's entrance was a critical area, and those who guarded it had significant access and influence. This context highlights the gravity of their conspiracy and the potential danger to the king.<p><b>when they had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes</b><br>The plot against King Xerxes reflects the political intrigue and danger present in ancient royal courts. Assassination attempts were not uncommon, as seen in other historical accounts, such as the murder of King Joash in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20-21</a>.
