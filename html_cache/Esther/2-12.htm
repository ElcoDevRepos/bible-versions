The twelve-month period reflects the Persian custom of extensive preparation, emphasizing the importance placed on physical beauty and presentation in the royal court. This time frame also indicates the level of competition and the high stakes involved in being chosen as queen. The mention of King Xerxes connects to the historical figure known as Xerxes I, who reigned from 486-465 BC, providing a historical anchor for the events in the Book of Esther.<p><b>the harem regulation required each young woman to receive beauty treatments</b><br>The harem was a secluded part of the royal household where the king's wives and concubines lived. The regulation of beauty treatments underscores the structured and controlled environment of the Persian court. This practice highlights the cultural emphasis on external beauty and the lengths to which the empire went to ensure that the women presented to the king were of the highest standard. The concept of beauty treatments can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparation, drawing a parallel to the Christian idea of sanctification and being made ready for the presence of the King of Kings.<p><b>with oil of myrrh for six months</b><br>Myrrh, a resin used for its fragrance and medicinal properties, was highly valued in ancient times. Its use in beauty treatments signifies purification and anointing, which can be seen as a type of Christ, who was anointed with myrrh (<a href="/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>, <a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). The six-month period of treatment with myrrh suggests a thorough process of purification and preparation, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleansing and readiness in the presence of God.<p><b>and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months</b><br>The additional six months of treatment with perfumes and cosmetics further emphasizes the importance of beauty and presentation in the Persian court. Perfumes and cosmetics were used to enhance attractiveness and appeal, reflecting the cultural values of the time. This extended period of beautification can be seen as a parallel to the Christian life, where believers are continually being transformed and prepared for their ultimate meeting with Christ. The use of perfumes and cosmetics also connects to the biblical theme of fragrance as a symbol of worship and devotion (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who becomes queen of Persia.

The verse reminds us that God values order, thorough preparation, and inner holiness, working through everyday details to position His servants for far-reaching purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Manner.</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">law</span> or <span class= "ital">ordinance,</span> as in <a href="/esther/1-8.htm" title="And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.">Esther 1:8</a>; <a href="/esther/1-15.htm" title="What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?">Esther 1:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- After she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women.</span> Rather, "After she had been (in the palace), according to the law prescribed to the women, twelve months."
