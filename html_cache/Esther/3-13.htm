The use of couriers indicates an advanced communication system, crucial for maintaining control over such a large territory. This system is also mentioned in <a href="/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>, where Mordecai uses it to counteract Haman's decree. The efficiency of this network underscores the seriousness and urgency of the decree.<p><b>with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews&#8212;young and old, women and children</b><br>The triplet "destroy, kill, and annihilate" emphasizes the totality and brutality of the intended genocide. This echoes the Amalekite threat in <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>, where Saul was commanded to completely destroy the Amalekites, a task he failed to complete. Haman, an Agagite, is seen as a descendant of the Amalekites, continuing the ancient enmity against the Jews. This decree is a stark reminder of the persistent threat against God's chosen people throughout history.<p><b>and to plunder their possessions</b><br>The inclusion of plundering indicates not only a desire for extermination but also for economic gain. This mirrors the actions of the enemies of Israel in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>, where the spoils of war are collected. The plundering aspect also highlights the greed and malice behind Haman's plot, contrasting with the later reversal in <a href="/esther/9-10.htm">Esther 9:10</a>, where the Jews do not lay hands on the plunder.<p><b>on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month</b><br>The specificity of the date underscores the premeditated nature of the plot. The thirteenth day of Adar becomes significant in Jewish history as the day before Purim, a festival celebrating the deliverance of the Jews from this decree. The choice of a single day for the execution of the plan suggests an attempt to prevent any escape or resistance. This date, chosen by casting lots (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>), ironically becomes a day of victory and celebration for the Jews, demonstrating God's providence and sovereignty over human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, Haman is the antagonist in the Book of Esther.

The Persian system of posts is thus described by Xenophon, who attributes its introduction to Cyrus: - "Stables for horses are erected along the various lines of route, at such a distance one from another as a horse can accomplish in a day. All the stables are provided with a number of horses and grooms. There is a post-master to preside over each, who receives the despatches along with the tired men and horses, and sends them on by fresh horses and fresh riders. Sometimes there is no stoppage in the conveyance even at night; since a night courier takes up the work of the day courier, and continues it. It has been said that these posts outstrip the flight of birds, which is not altogether true; but beyond a doubt it is the most rapid of all methods of conveyance by land" ('Cyrop.,' 8:6, &sect; 17). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish</span>. The writer quotes from the edict, which appears to have had as many surplus words as a modern English law paper. <span class="cmt_word">Young and old, little children and women</span>. "To take the father's life and spare the child's" was thought to be an act of folly in ancient times. Wives and children of criminals were, as a matter of course, put to death with them. This was anciently even the Jewish practice (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>), and was quite an established usage in Persia (Herod., 3:119). <span class="cmt_word">The thirteenth day</span>. The Septuagint has "the fourteenth day" in its professed copy of the decree, but confirms the Hebrew text here by making the thirteenth the actual day of the struggle (<a href="/esther/9-1.htm">Esther 9:1</a>). The fourteenth and fifteenth are the days now kept by the Jews; but it is suspected that an alteration has been made in order to assimilate the Purim to the passover feast, which began on the 14th of Nisan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the letters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5612.htm">Strong's 5612: </a> </span><span class="str2">A missive, document, writing, book</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
