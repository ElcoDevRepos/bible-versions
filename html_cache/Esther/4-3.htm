The king's edict, influenced by Haman, called for the destruction of all Jews, highlighting the widespread reach and power of the Persian administration. This decree's impact was felt across the entire empire, demonstrating the centralized authority of the king and the vulnerability of the Jewish people scattered throughout these regions. The edict's reach underscores the urgency and desperation of the situation faced by the Jews.<p><b>there was great mourning among the Jews</b><br>The mourning reflects the deep distress and fear among the Jewish communities. Mourning in the ancient Near East often involved public displays of grief, indicating the severity of the threat. This collective mourning signifies a unified response to the existential threat posed by the edict, emphasizing the communal nature of Jewish identity and their shared fate. The mourning also serves as a precursor to the eventual deliverance, highlighting the theme of divine providence and intervention.<p><b>They fasted, wept, and lamented</b><br>Fasting, weeping, and lamenting are traditional Jewish expressions of grief and repentance. Fasting is often associated with seeking God's favor or intervention, as seen in other biblical instances such as the fasts of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>) and the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29-31</a>). Weeping and lamenting are outward expressions of inner turmoil and desperation. These actions reflect a deep spiritual response, seeking divine mercy and intervention in a time of crisis.<p><b>and many lay in sackcloth and ashes</b><br>Sackcloth and ashes are symbols of mourning, repentance, and humility before God. Sackcloth, a coarse material, was worn to express sorrow and penitence, while ashes symbolized desolation and mortality. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the stories of Job (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>) and the repentance of the people of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>). The use of sackcloth and ashes indicates a recognition of human frailty and a plea for divine intervention, aligning with the broader biblical theme of repentance leading to redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia who plays a crucial role in the deliverance of her people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who first learns of Haman's plot against the Jews and urges Esther to intervene.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plots to annihilate the Jews, prompting the mourning described in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who unknowingly authorizes Haman's decree against the Jews.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews_in_persia.htm">The Jews in Persia</a></b><br>The Jewish community living in the Persian Empire, facing extermination due to Haman's edict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_collective_mourning_and_prayer.htm">The Power of Collective Mourning and Prayer</a></b><br>The Jews' unified response in fasting and mourning highlights the power of communal prayer and repentance in seeking divine intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_fasting_and_sackcloth.htm">The Significance of Fasting and Sackcloth</a></b><br>Fasting and wearing sackcloth are outward expressions of inner humility and repentance, demonstrating a deep dependence on God during times of distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god_in_times_of_crisis.htm">Trusting God in Times of Crisis</a></b><br>Despite the dire circumstances, the Jews' actions reflect a trust in God's sovereignty and a hope for deliverance, encouraging believers to rely on God in their own trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_times_of_peril.htm">The Role of Leadership in Times of Peril</a></b><br>Mordecai's leadership and Esther's eventual intervention underscore the importance of godly leadership and courage in facing challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_providence_in_difficult_situations.htm">God's Providence in Difficult Situations</a></b><br>The unfolding events in Esther reveal God's unseen hand at work, reminding believers of His providence even when He seems silent.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_4_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 4:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_4_3_Power_of_group_fasting.htm">How does Esther 4:3 illustrate the power of communal fasting and prayer?

So wherever Jews had settled, the decree reached them. Nothing was hidden, no pocket of safety remained, and the corporate life of God&#8217;s covenant people was threatened everywhere at once. This echoes how the Assyrian exile had earlier scattered Israel &#8220;to the ends of the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-4.htm">Deuteronomy 30:4</a>), yet even there the Lord promised to gather them. The phrase underlines how total the danger seemed, yet also how completely God would have to intervene if His people were to survive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To which the king&#8217;s command and edict came</b><p>Haman&#8217;s letters &#8220;destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews&#8221; (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>) bore the royal seal; under Persian law such orders were irreversible (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>).

What appears unchangeable in earthly courts is still subject to the sovereign Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There was great mourning among the Jews</b><p>Their first response was grief, not revolt. Like Nehemiah, who &#8220;sat down and wept and mourned for days&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>), the Jews sensed that their help must come from God. Corporate mourning connects them with earlier sorrows&#8212;&#8220;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>).

Throughout Scripture, fasting accompanies urgent prayer: Jehoshaphat &#8220;proclaimed a fast&#8221; when threatened (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>); the Lord urges, &#8220;Return to Me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>). Bullet-point look at their three-fold actions:<p>&#8226; Fasting &#8211; humbling themselves (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>)<p>&#8226; Weeping &#8211; honest emotion before God (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>)<p>&#8226; Lamenting &#8211; voicing sorrow and plea for help (<a href="/bsb/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13</a>)<p>Together, these practices declare dependence on the Lord who alone can reverse the edict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Many lay in sackcloth and ashes</b><p>Sackcloth and ashes are the classic signs of deep distress and repentance: Job &#8220;sat among the ashes&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>); Daniel &#8220;turned to the Lord&#8230; in sackcloth and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>); Nineveh&#8217;s king did the same (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>). By adopting this posture the Jews confessed their sins, appealed to God&#8217;s mercy, and publicly disowned any confidence in themselves. Outward humiliation mirrored inward contrition, preparing hearts for the deliverance God was already orchestrating through Esther.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3</a> paints a picture of total crisis met by total dependence on God.

Their united lament became the backdrop for the miraculous rescue God would soon unveil, proving again that even the most ironclad human edicts bow to His sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in every province</span>.

Thus an ever-increasing cloud of grief overshadowed the land. GRIEF OF ESTHER. HER COMMUNICATIONS WITH MORDECAI. SHE CONSENTS TO RISK MAKING AN APPEAL TO THE KING (<a href="/esther/4-4.htm">Esther 4:4-17</a>). Esther, in the seclusion of the harem, knew nothing of what the king and Haman had determined on. No one in the palace suspected how vitally she was concerned in the matter, since none knew that she was a Jewess, and state affairs are not commonly discussed between an Oriental monarch and a young wife. It was known, however, that she took an interest in Mordecai; and when that official was seen outside the palace gate in his mourning garb, it was reported to the queen. Not being aware why he grieved, but thinking that perhaps it was some light matter which he took too much to heart, she sent him a change of raiment, and requested him to put off his sackcloth. But Mordecai, without assigning any reason, refused (ver. 4). Esther upon this caused inquiry to be made of Mordecai concerning the reason of his mourning, and in this way became acquainted with what had happened (vers. 5-9). At the same time she found herself called on by Mordecai to incur a great danger, since he requested her to go at once to the king, and to intercede with him for her people (ver. 8). In reply, the queen pointed out the extreme risk which she would run in entering the royal presence uninvited, and the little chance that there was of her receiving a summons, since she had not had one for thirty days (ver. 11). Mordecai, however, was inexorable. He reminded Esther that she herself was threatened by the decree, and was not more likely to escape than any other Jew or Jewess; declared his belief that, if she withheld her aid, deliverance would arise from some other quarter; warned her that neglect of duty was apt to provoke a heavy retribution, and suggested that she might have been raised to her queenly dignity for the express purpose of her being thus able to save her nation (vers. 13, 14). The dutiful daughter, the true Jewess, could resist no longer; she only asked that Mordecai and the other Jews in Susa would fast for her three days, while she and her maidens also fasted, and then she would take her life in her hand, and enter the royal presence uninvited, though it was contrary to the law; the risk should be run, and then, as she said with a simple pathos never excelled, "if I perish, I perish" (ver. 16). Satisfied with this reply, Mordecai "went his way," and held the three days' fast which Esther had requested (ver. 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
