This secrecy was crucial for her safety and the unfolding of God's plan. The Jewish people were often subject to prejudice and persecution, and revealing her identity could have jeopardized her position and influence. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God's providence and protection over His people, even when they are in foreign lands, as seen in the stories of Joseph in Egypt and Daniel in Babylon.<p><b>just as Mordecai had instructed</b><br>Mordecai's role as a guardian and advisor to Esther is significant. His wisdom and foresight are evident in his instruction to keep her identity hidden. This reflects the biblical principle of honoring and obeying parental or guardian authority, as seen in the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Mordecai's guidance also highlights the importance of strategic wisdom in navigating complex social and political environments.<p><b>She obeyed Mordecai&#8217;s command</b><br>Esther's obedience to Mordecai is a testament to her character and the respect she had for him. This obedience is consistent with the biblical theme of submission to authority, which is often portrayed as a virtue. It also underscores the importance of trust and loyalty in relationships, particularly within the family structure. Esther's compliance with Mordecai's instructions can be seen as a precursor to her later actions, where her obedience to God's leading results in the deliverance of her people.<p><b>as she had done under his care</b><br>This phrase indicates a long-standing relationship of trust and obedience between Esther and Mordecai. It suggests that Esther's character was shaped by her upbringing and the values instilled in her by Mordecai. This continuity of behavior emphasizes the importance of a godly upbringing and the impact of mentorship. It also reflects the biblical principle that faithfulness in small things leads to greater responsibilities, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who became queen of Persia.

(<a href="/esther/2-20.htm">Esther 2:20</a>a).<p>&#8226; This statement underscores Esther&#8217;s intentional silence about her Jewish identity in the Persian court, a choice that preserved her place in a potentially hostile environment (cf. <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By God&#8217;s providence, her hidden lineage positions her later to advocate for the Jews at the crisis point (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that believers sometimes exercise prudent discretion without denying faith, much like Joseph concealing his identity from his brothers for a season (<a href="/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Mordecai had instructed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;just as Mordecai had instructed&#8221;

<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Her compliance illustrates that true faith is active, not merely professed; obedience is the evidence of trust (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the blessing linked to obeying godly counsel&#8212;later, this same obedience becomes pivotal in Israel&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/esther/4-13.htm">Esther 4:13&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as she had done under his care</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;as she had done under his care&#8221;

The wording emphasizes relational continuity: her respect for Mordecai did not change with her rise to royalty (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God often shapes future leaders in private, everyday faithfulness before public responsibility (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34&#8211;37</a>;

In the East a person's relations usually rise with him; and the reader would naturally expect that when Esther was once queen, Mordecai would have become rich and great. Esther's silence accounts for Mordecai's low estate; Mordecai's command (see ver. 10) accounts for Esther's silence<span class="cmt_word">. For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai</span>. The royal dignity did not change Esther's heart. She was still the dutiful child she had been so many years.
