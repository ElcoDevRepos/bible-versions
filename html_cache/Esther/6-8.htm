A royal robe worn by the king would be a garment of immense value and honor, signifying the king's favor. This act of wearing the king's robe is reminiscent of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>, where Pharaoh dresses him in fine linen, symbolizing his rise to power. The robe represents the transfer of honor and authority, a theme that echoes throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments of salvation and righteousness are mentioned.<p><b>and a horse on which the king himself has ridden</b><br>The king's horse was not merely a mode of transportation but a symbol of royal authority and prestige. In the Persian Empire, the king's horse would be well-known and recognized by the people, making it a public display of the king's favor. This parallels the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem on a donkey, as described in <a href="/matthew/21-7.htm">Matthew 21:7-9</a>, where the animal signifies peace and fulfillment of prophecy. The horse in Esther's context underscores the honor being bestowed upon the individual.<p><b>one with a royal crest placed on its head</b><br>The royal crest, likely a decorative ornament or emblem, would signify the horse's association with the king, further emphasizing the honor being conferred. This crest would be a visible sign of the king's endorsement and authority. In biblical symbolism, crowns and crests often represent authority and victory, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, where Christ is depicted with many crowns. The crest on the horse in Esther's story highlights the public recognition and elevation of the individual being honored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Whether Hainan's character had at its best estate much discretion, or whether he rose to his high position, not by the qualities that should commend a statesman to a king, but, like many another Eastern Vizier, had by flattery and base arts gained the royal favour, we cannot say; here he shows the lack of the most ordinary discretion, his vanity is so inordinate that he cannot see the possibility of any one's merits save his own. The request which Haman made may be illustrated by the permission granted by Xerxes to his uncle Artabanus to put on the royal robes and sleep in the royal bed at Susa (Herod, vii. 15-17).<p><span class= "bld">The horse that the king rideth upon.</span>--Thus Pharaoh, desiring-to honour Joseph, made him ride in his own chariot (<a href="/genesis/41-43.htm" title="And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.">Genesis 41:43</a>): David, wishing to show that Solomon had really become king in his father's lifetime, commands that he should ride on the king's mule (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1Kings 1:33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-44.htm" title="And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule:">1Kings 1:44</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the crown royal which is set upon his head.</span>--If we take the Hebrew here quite literally, the meaning must be <span class= "ital">and on whose</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the horse's) <span class= "ital">head a royal crown is set.</span> The only objection to this view is, that there appears to be no evidence of such a custom among the Persians.

See vers. 9 and 11, where the dress and the horse are referred to, but the crown, as an adjunct of the horse, not particularised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">have them bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a royal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#7733;&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4438.htm">Strong's 4438: </a> </span><span class="str2">Royalty, royal power, reign, kingdom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">robe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3830.htm">Strong's 3830: </a> </span><span class="str2">A garment, clothing, raiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
