Wealth in ancient times was often seen as a sign of divine favor and personal success. Haman's recounting of his wealth reflects his pride and self-importance. In the broader biblical context, wealth is frequently discussed in terms of its potential to lead to pride and downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."<p><b>his many sons</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern cultures, having many sons was considered a great blessing and a sign of strength and legacy. Sons were seen as carriers of the family name and protectors of the family's future. Haman's boasting about his sons highlights his desire for a lasting legacy and his belief in his own enduring influence. This is contrasted with the biblical theme that true legacy is found in righteousness and faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>.<p><b>and all the ways the king had honored and promoted him</b><br>Haman's position as second in command to King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) is a testament to his political acumen and the favor he found with the king. The honor and promotion he received are central to his identity and his sense of self-worth. This phrase underscores the theme of human ambition and the fleeting nature of worldly honor, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>, where the pursuit of earthly achievements is described as "a chasing after the wind."<p><b>over the other officials and servants</b><br>Haman's elevation above other officials and servants highlights the hierarchical nature of the Persian court and the competitive environment in which he thrived. This phrase also sets the stage for the conflict between Haman and Mordecai, as Mordecai's refusal to bow to Haman becomes a personal affront to his pride. The biblical narrative often contrasts the exaltation of the proud with the eventual vindication of the humble, as seen in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, known for his pride and animosity towards the Jews, particularly Mordecai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who elevated Haman to a position of power, setting the stage for the events in the Book of Esther.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of Persia, who refused to bow to Haman, inciting Haman's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa</a></b><br>The capital city of the Persian Empire, where the events of the Book of Esther take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia, who plays a crucial role in the deliverance of her people from Haman's plot.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Haman's pride blinds him to the reality of his situation and leads to his eventual downfall.

His speech is self-focused; there is no mention of God, gratitude, or concern for others.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>) contrasts sharply with Haman&#8217;s self-promotion.<p>&#8226; Jesus told of a similar heart in the Pharisee who &#8220;stood by himself and prayed, &#8216;God, I thank You that I am not like the other men&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>). Pride isolates; it blinds Haman to the counsel or needs of anyone else.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his glorious wealth</b><p>&#8226; Haman&#8217;s first boast is his riches, as though material abundance equals divine favor.<p>&#8226; Scripture warns, &#8220;Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be conceited or to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus counseled, &#8220;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth&#8230; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>).

Pride distorts a blessing into bragging rights.<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s downfall shows that honoring family above the LORD brings judgment (<a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the ways the king had honored and promoted him</b><p>&#8226; Haman exults in the royal favors bestowed by Xerxes, forgetting that every elevation ultimately comes from God: &#8220;He raises the poor from the dust&#8230; He seats them with princes&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s boast&#8212;&#8220;Is this not Babylon the Great, which I myself have built&#8230; by my vast power?&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>)&#8212;ended with humbling; the parallel warns against claiming credit that belongs to God.<p>&#8226; &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>) foreshadows the reversal waiting for Haman.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>over the other officials and servants</b><p>&#8226; Haman&#8217;s joy is comparative: he delights in being &#8220;over&#8221; others.

Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-43</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>). Haman does the opposite, sowing seeds of inevitable downfall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/5-11.htm">Esther 5:11</a> exposes the anatomy of pride. Haman itemizes wealth, family, promotion, and superiority, measuring life by worldly metrics and centering everything on self.
