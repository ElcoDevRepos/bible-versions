The term "sold out" indicates betrayal and a transaction that has taken place, referring to Haman's plot to destroy the Jews, which he financed by offering the king a large sum of money (<a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>). The words "destruction, death, and annihilation" emphasize the totality of the threat, echoing the language of complete eradication found in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, where God commands the Israelites to utterly destroy the Canaanite nations. This reflects the severity of the decree against the Jews, which was not just a physical threat but also a spiritual and cultural one, aiming to erase their identity. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the ultimate deliverance from sin and death through Christ, who saves His people from spiritual annihilation.<p><b>If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants,</b><br>Here, Esther contrasts the severity of their situation with a lesser evil. Being sold as servants would have been a common fate in the ancient world, often resulting from debt or war. This reference underscores the gravity of their current predicament, as servitude, while undesirable, would have at least preserved their lives. The mention of "menservants and maidservants" also reflects the social and economic structures of the time, where slavery was a recognized institution. This phrase highlights Esther's wisdom and rhetorical skill in presenting her case to the king, showing that she is not complaining about a lesser misfortune but a matter of life and death.<p><b>I would have remained silent,</b><br>Esther's statement about remaining silent if the situation were less severe demonstrates her understanding of the king's priorities and the political dynamics at play. Silence in the face of lesser injustices was often a pragmatic choice in ancient courts, where speaking out could lead to personal risk. This also reflects the biblical theme of knowing when to speak and when to remain silent, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>. Esther's choice to speak up at this moment is a pivotal act of courage and faith, aligning with the biblical principle of standing up for justice and righteousness.<p><b>because no such distress would justify burdening the king.</b><br>Esther shows respect for the king's position and responsibilities by acknowledging that lesser issues should not trouble him. This reflects the cultural context of the Persian Empire, where the king was seen as the ultimate authority, and his time was considered precious. By framing her plea in this way, Esther tactfully appeals to the king's sense of justice without appearing to challenge his authority. This approach is consistent with the biblical principle of respecting authority while seeking justice, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>. Esther's wisdom in addressing the king is a model of how to navigate complex political and social situations with integrity and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who courageously intercedes for her people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who is unaware of Haman's plot against the Jews.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plots to destroy the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_people.htm">The Jewish People</a></b><br>The target of Haman's genocidal plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_banquet.htm">The Royal Banquet</a></b><br>The setting where Esther reveals Haman's plot to the king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_advocacy.htm">Courage in Advocacy</a></b><br>Esther's boldness in speaking up for her people is a model for advocating for justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>God's unseen hand is at work, orchestrating events for the deliverance of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_influence.htm">The Power of Influence</a></b><br>Esther's position as queen highlights the importance of using one's influence for godly purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_silence.htm">The Cost of Silence</a></b><br>Esther's willingness to speak out, despite the risk, teaches the importance of not remaining silent in the face of evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Esther's faith is demonstrated through her actions, reminding believers to act on their faith in challenging situations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_7_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 7:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_7_4_Courage_vs_Injustice_Today.htm">How does Esther 7:4 demonstrate courage in confronting injustice and evil today?

Herein Esther at once makes confession of her nationality, and relying on the king's still recent gratitude to one of the race, aided by his present cordiality to herself, she risks, as indeed she can no longer help doing, the fate of herself and her race on the momentary impulse of her fickle lord. Happily for her, God has willed that these, perhaps at any other time untrustworthy grounds of reliance, shall suffice. The "hearts of kings are in His rule and governance," and now the heart of one is "disposed and turned, as it seemeth best to His godly wisdom."<p><span class= "bld">Although the enemy. . . .</span>--The meaning of this clause is not quite clear. The literal translation is, <span class= "ital">although</span> (or <span class= "ital">because</span>)<span class= "ital"> the enemy is not equal to</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> does not make up for) <span class= "ital">the king's hurt.</span> This may mean (<span class= "ital">a</span>) that Haman, <span class= "ital">though</span> willing to pay a large sum into the royal treasury, cannot thereby make up for the loss which the king must incur by wholesale massacre being carried on in his realm; or (b) "were we merely to be sold into slavery, instead of being killed outright, I should have said nothing, because the enemy was not one worth the king's while to trouble himself about." We prefer the former view. The word "enemy" is that translated <span class= "ital">adversary,</span> in <a href="/esther/7-6.htm" title="And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.">Esther 7:6</a>, and properly means one who oppresses, afflicts, distresses. The word which is, literally, <span class= "ital">equal to, comparable with,</span> has already occurred in <a href="/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>; <a href="/esther/5-13.htm" title="Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.">Esther 5:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are sold, I and my people</span>. Haman has paid our price, has given ten thousand talents for us, and you, O king, have sold us to him. The reproach is covert, but clearly contained in the words; and so the king must have understood Esther. <span class="cmt_word">To be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish</span>. The use of three synonyms for one and the same thing is not mere verbiage, but very expressive. "We are sold, all of us, to be overwhelmed in one universal, promiscuous, unsparing destruction." <span class="cmt_word">Although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage</span>. "Although, even in that case, the enemy (Haman) could not (by the payment that he has made) compensate the king for the damage that he would suffer by losing so many subjects." So Gesenius, Rambach, Dathe, and others. But it is simpler, and Perhaps better, to understand the passage as Bertheau does: "for the enemy (Haman) is not worthy to vex the king," or "is not worth vexing the king about." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
