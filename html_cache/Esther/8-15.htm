Mordecai, once a humble Jewish man, now holds a position of high honor and authority. This transformation reflects the providential reversal of fortunes, a common theme in biblical narratives. The presence of the king indicates Mordecai's newfound favor and influence, reminiscent of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-43</a>).<p><b>in royal garments of blue and white</b><br>The colors blue and white were often associated with royalty and nobility in ancient Persia. Blue, in particular, was a color of significance, symbolizing divinity and authority. The use of these colors in Mordecai's garments underscores his elevated status and the divine favor upon him. This imagery can be connected to the priestly garments described in <a href="/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-35</a>, which also included blue, signifying a connection to God's chosen leaders.<p><b>with a large gold crown</b><br>The gold crown represents authority and honor. In the context of the Persian Empire, such a crown would signify Mordecai's high rank and the king's trust in him. This imagery can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory and crowning of believers, as described in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, where a crown of righteousness is promised to those who have kept the faith.<p><b>and a purple robe of fine linen</b><br>Purple was a color associated with wealth and royalty, as the dye was rare and expensive. The fine linen indicates quality and purity. This attire not only signifies Mordecai's new position but also reflects the biblical theme of being clothed in righteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments of salvation and robes of righteousness are mentioned.<p><b>And the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced</b><br>The reaction of the city of Susa highlights the communal impact of Mordecai's rise. The joy and celebration reflect the relief and hope brought to the Jewish people and the city as a whole. This rejoicing can be compared to the joy of the Israelites upon their deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate joy and celebration in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where God's people will rejoice in His eternal presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew who rose to prominence in the Persian Empire, becoming second in command to King Xerxes.

What began with sackcloth (<a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>) ends with splendor, displaying how &#8220;He lifts the needy from the ash heap&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; For the Jewish exiles, seeing one of their own in these colors preached hope: God had not forgotten His covenant people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A large gold crown</b><p>&#8226; A crown denotes delegated sovereignty (<a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>).

The Persian monarch himself wore a purple robe and an inner vest of purple striped with white ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 153, 154). The robes of honour which he gave away were of many different colours, but generally of a single tint throughout (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3, &sect; 3); but the one given to Mordecai seems to have been blue with white stripes. These were the colours of the royal diadem (Q. Curt., 'Vit. Alex.,' 3:3). <span class="cmt_word">A great crown of gold</span>. Not a tall crown, like that of the monarch, which is called in Hebrew <span class="accented">kether</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but '<span class="accented">atarah</span>, a crown of an inferior kind, frequently worn by nobles<span class="cmt_word">. And with a garment of fine linen and purple</span>. The "fine linen" was of course white. The real meaning of the word <span class="accented">thakrik</span>, translated "garment," is doubtful. Gesenius understands an outer garment' 'the long and flowing robe of an Oriental monarch;" in which case the "apparel" previously mentioned must be the inner vest. Others, as Patrick, make the <span class="accented">thakrik to</span> be the inner, and the "apparel" (<span class="accented">l'bush</span>) the outer garment. The Septuagint, however, translates <span class="accented">thakrik</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and its conjunction with the "crown" favours this rendering. The <span class="accented">diadem</span> proper of a Persian monarch was a band or fillet encircling the lower part of his crown, and was of blue, spotted or striped with white. Ahasuerus seems to have allowed Mordecai to wear a diadem of white and purple. <span class="cmt_word">The city of Shushan rejoiced</span>. As the Susanchites had been "perplexed" at the first edict (<a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), so were they "rejoiced" at the second. Such of them as were Persians would naturally sympathise with the Jews.
