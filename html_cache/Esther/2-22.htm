His presence there suggests he held a position of some authority or influence. The plot he uncovered was an assassination attempt against King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), orchestrated by two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthana and Teresh. This reflects the political intrigue and danger present in the Persian court. Mordecai's vigilance and loyalty to the king, despite being a foreigner, highlight his integrity and the providential role he plays in the narrative.<p><b>he reported it to Queen Esther</b><br>Mordecai's relationship with Esther, his cousin whom he had raised as his own daughter, was crucial. Esther, now queen, had not revealed her Jewish identity, as Mordecai had advised. This secrecy was strategic, allowing her to navigate the complexities of the Persian court. Mordecai's decision to report the plot through Esther demonstrates his trust in her and his understanding of the court's dynamics. It also underscores the theme of divine providence, as Esther's position as queen was instrumental in saving the king and later, the Jewish people.<p><b>and she informed the king on Mordecai&#8217;s behalf</b><br>Esther's role as an intermediary between Mordecai and the king is significant. Her ability to communicate directly with King Xerxes indicates her influence and the trust the king placed in her. By crediting Mordecai, Esther ensures that he receives recognition for his loyalty, which later becomes pivotal in the story. This act of reporting the plot not only saves the king's life but also sets the stage for Mordecai's eventual rise to power. The narrative foreshadows the deliverance of the Jewish people, illustrating themes of justice and divine orchestration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, who raised Esther as his own daughter.
