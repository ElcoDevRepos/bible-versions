This exile fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>) and was a result of the Israelites' disobedience to God. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the spiritual and political center for the Jewish people, making its fall a devastating event. The exile was a period of deep reflection and transformation for the Jewish community, leading to a renewed focus on the Law and the writings of the prophets.<p><b>by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. He is known for his military conquests, including the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, and for his grand building projects, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. His role in the exile is significant as it marks a period where God used foreign rulers to discipline His people, as seen in other parts of Scripture (e.g., <a href="/daniel/1.htm">Daniel 1:1-2</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's interactions with figures like Daniel and the three Hebrew boys also highlight God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<p><b>among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah</b><br>Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin, was the king of Judah who reigned for a brief period before being deposed by Nebuchadnezzar. His captivity, along with the elite of Judah, marked the second deportation to Babylon around 597 BC. This event is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9-10</a>. Jeconiah's exile is significant in biblical prophecy and genealogy, as he is mentioned in the lineage of Jesus Christ in <a href="/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-12</a>. Despite the curse pronounced on his line (<a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>), God's promise to David's lineage is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, demonstrating God's faithfulness and redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew from the tribe of Benjamin, living in Susa, who plays a crucial role in the account of Esther.

Babylon&#8217;s armies invaded Judah and uprooted its people, fulfilling the warnings of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> and the prophecies of <a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>. This forced removal was not random&#8212;it was God&#8217;s declared judgment on national sin (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2-4</a>). The exile also preserved a faithful remnant, placing Mordecai in Susa at the precise time God would need him (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Jerusalem</b><p>The phrase highlights Jerusalem&#8217;s central place in God&#8217;s plan. Losing the city underscored the depth of Judah&#8217;s disobedience (<a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>). Yet even in displacement, the exiles longed for Zion (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-6</a>). Mordecai&#8217;s roots in Jerusalem remind us that identity in God&#8217;s covenant people persists, even when geography changes (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar was a real monarch (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-2</a>) whom God called &#8220;My servant&#8221; to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>). The king thought he was expanding an empire; God was steering redemptive history. Knowing the actual ruler involved anchors Esther&#8217;s narrative in verifiable events, encouraging confidence that the Bible records true history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among those taken captive</b><p>Mordecai&#8217;s ancestor was part of a massive community relocation (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). Exile forged solidarity among the deportees and kept them distinct from pagan culture (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>). That shared experience later united the Jews of Susa when Haman&#8217;s decree threatened them (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>). God often works through corporate experiences to prepare His people for future deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Jeconiah king of Judah</b><p>Jeconiah (also called Jehoiachin) surrendered during the second Babylonian siege (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>). Taking the king&#8212;and skilled citizens&#8212;was strategic: it weakened Judah and enriched Babylon. It also set the stage for the seventy-year exile foretold by <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>. Linking Mordecai&#8217;s line to Jeconiah&#8217;s deportation fixes the date around 597 BC, showing that several generations had lived in Persia by Esther&#8217;s day (<a href="/esther/2-5.htm">Esther 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every clause of <a href="/esther/2-6.htm">Esther 2:6</a> roots Mordecai&#8217;s family in a real exile from Jerusalem under Nebuchadnezzar, alongside King Jeconiah. The verse validates God&#8217;s earlier warnings, affirms His control over world events, and explains how a Jewish cousin named Esther could rise in a Persian court at the critical hour. History, prophecy, and providence converge in this single sentence, assuring readers that God&#8217;s Word is accurate and His purposes unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Who had been</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The antecedent is obviously Kish, though as far as the mere grammar goes it might have been Mordecai.<p><span class= "bld">Jeconiah.</span>--That is, Jehoiachin.
