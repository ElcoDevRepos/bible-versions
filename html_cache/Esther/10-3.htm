This mirrors the story of Joseph in Egypt, who also rose to a position of great authority under Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>). Mordecai's ascent highlights God's providence and the fulfillment of His plans through faithful individuals. Historically, the Persian Empire was vast, and being second in command meant Mordecai wielded considerable influence, which he used to protect and benefit the Jewish people.<p><b>preeminent among the Jews</b><br>Mordecai's preeminence among the Jews signifies his leadership and the respect he commanded within the Jewish community. This status was not only due to his position in the Persian court but also because of his role in saving the Jews from Haman's plot (<a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15-17</a>). His leadership is reminiscent of other Jewish leaders like Moses and David, who were also esteemed among their people. Mordecai's prominence is a testament to his character and the divine favor upon him.<p><b>and highly favored by his many kinsmen</b><br>Mordecai's favor among his kinsmen indicates the unity and support he received from the Jewish community. This favor was likely due to his integrity, wisdom, and the deliverance he helped secure for the Jews. It reflects the biblical principle that righteous leadership earns the trust and admiration of the people (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). Mordecai's favor also underscores the importance of community and solidarity among the Jewish people during their time in exile.<p><b>seeking the good of his people</b><br>Mordecai's actions were motivated by a desire to seek the welfare of his people, aligning with the biblical mandate to love one's neighbor and seek justice (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). His leadership was characterized by selflessness and a commitment to the common good, which is a hallmark of godly leadership. This phrase also echoes the role of Christ, who came to seek and save the lost and work for the good of humanity (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>and speaking peace to all his countrymen</b><br>Mordecai's efforts to speak peace reflect the biblical ideal of shalom, which encompasses wholeness, harmony, and well-being. His leadership brought stability and peace to the Jewish community within the Persian Empire. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but the presence of justice and righteousness, akin to the peace that Christ offers to believers (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). Mordecai's role as a peacemaker is a model for Christian conduct, emphasizing reconciliation and harmony.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew who rose to a position of great power in the Persian Empire, second only to King Xerxes.

How long he kept it, whether death or disgrace brought it to a close, and if the latter, from what cause, we cannot say. All we know is, that near the end of Xerxes' reign his favourite and chief adviser was Artabanus, the captain of the guard, by whom he was murdered in B.C. 464.
