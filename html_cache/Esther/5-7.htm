Her reply is a calculated and strategic move, reflecting her wisdom and understanding of court protocol. Esther's ability to speak directly to the king highlights her position and favor in the royal court, which is crucial for the unfolding of her plan to save her people. This moment is a turning point in the narrative, showcasing Esther's bravery and the divine providence at work in her life.<p><b>This is my petition</b><br>The term "petition" indicates a formal request, often used in legal or royal contexts. Esther's use of this word suggests the seriousness and gravity of her appeal. In the Persian Empire, such petitions were typically presented with great care and respect, acknowledging the authority of the king. Esther's petition is not just a personal request but one that carries the weight of her people's survival. This reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where a mediator stands in the gap for others, a role that foreshadows Christ's intercession for humanity.<p><b>and my request</b><br>The word "request" complements "petition," emphasizing the dual nature of Esther's appeal. While "petition" may imply a formal plea, "request" suggests a more personal appeal, highlighting Esther's relational approach to the king. This duality underscores the complexity of Esther's situation, where she must balance her personal relationship with the king and her duty to her people. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His dual nature, mediates between God and humanity, fulfilling both divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, married to King Xerxes (Ahasuerus).

After two days of hosting banquets, Esther finally answers the king&#8217;s repeated inquiry (<a href="/esther/5-3.htm">Esther 5:3</a>, cf. 5:6).<p>&#8226; Her calm and measured reply mirrors Nehemiah&#8217;s prayerful pause before speaking to Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4</a>), showing how the Lord equips His servants with timely words (<a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226;

Esther still hesitates to prefer her real request. We are not likely to be able in the nineteenth century to understand all the motives that actuated her, or all the workings of her mind. Perhaps nothing kept her back but the natural fear of a repulse, and a desire to defer the evil day; perhaps she saw some real advantage in putting off the determination of the matter. At any rate, she again declined to declare herself, and merely gave her two guests a second invitation for the ensuing evening. She concludes, however, with a promise that she will ask no further respite. <span class="cmt_word">I will do to-morrow as the king hath said</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will prefer my real request; I will ask the favour which was in my thoughts when I adventured myself in the inner court without having received an invitation. <p> CHAPTER 5:9-14 HAMAN, EXULTING AT THESE SIGNS OF ROYAL FAVOUR, IS THE MORE EXASPERATED AT MORDECAI'S CONTEMPT OF HIM. AT THE BIDDING OF HIS WIFE HE RESOLVES TO IMPALE MORDECAI, AND CAUSES A LOFTY CROSS TO BE ERECTED FOR THE PURPOSE (<a href="/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9-14</a>). The favour shown him by the king and queen in admitting him to the very close intimacy implied in their making him the sole companion of their private hours, produced in Haman a dangerous exaltation of spirit. He seemed to himself to have attained the pinnacle of a subject's greatness. Returning home in this frame of mind, and having to pass through the gate where Mordecai was on duty, he was more vexed than usual with that official's disrespect, which was more pointed and open than it had ever been before (ver. 9). However, he took no immediate notice of the porter's conduct (ver. 10), but proceeded to his own house, where he assembled his friends, and communicated to them, and at the same time to Zeresh his wife, the circumstances which had so greatly raised his spirits. The climax was that "Esther the queen had let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but himself; nay, more, he was again invited on the morrow to banquet with her and the king" (ver. 12). He added, however, Mordecai's insult remaining fresh in his recollection, that all his glory, all his honours, availed him nothing - were as nothing in his eyes - so long as he was condemned to see Mordecai the Jew every time that he passed though the palace gate, and to be treated by him with contempt and contumely (ver. 13). Upon this Zeresh made, and Haman's friends approved, a proposal that a lofty cross should be at once erected in the court of Haman's house, on which Mordecai should be impaled, with the king's consent, as soon as it was finished. Haman agreed to this, recovered his spirits, and gave orders for the cross to be made (ver. 14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Esther</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1505;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;es&#183;t&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_635.htm">Strong's 635: </a> </span><span class="str2">Esther -- 'star', Ahasuerus' queen who delivered Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ta&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6030.htm">Strong's 6030: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer, respond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;This is my petition</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7596.htm">Strong's 7596: </a> </span><span class="str2">Request, thing asked for</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and my request:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1246.htm">Strong's 1246: </a> </span><span class="str2">Request, entreaty</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/esther/5-7.htm">OT History: Esther 5:7 Then Esther answered and said My petition (Est Esth.
