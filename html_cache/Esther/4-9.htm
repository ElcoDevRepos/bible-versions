His role highlights the structured hierarchy and the trust placed in him by Esther. The presence of eunuchs in royal courts was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, as they were often seen as loyal and trustworthy servants. This phrase indicates the communication method within the palace, where direct access to the queen was limited, necessitating intermediaries.<p><b>and relayed Mordecai&#8217;s response</b><br>Mordecai, a Jew living in Susa, is Esther's cousin and adoptive father. His response is crucial, as it reflects the urgency and gravity of the situation facing the Jewish people. Mordecai's communication through Hathach underscores the perilous position of the Jews under King Xerxes' decree, which Haman orchestrated. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Esther's courageous intervention. The use of intermediaries like Hathach also illustrates the limitations and risks of communication in a royal setting.<p><b>to Esther.</b><br>Esther, a Jewish woman who became queen of Persia, is central to the narrative. Her position in the palace is both a place of influence and isolation, as she is initially unaware of the decree against her people. This phrase marks a turning point where Esther becomes aware of the crisis and is called to act. Her role as a mediator for her people is a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity. Esther's story is a testament to divine providence and the courage required to fulfill one's God-given purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hathach.htm">Hathach</a></b><br>A eunuch in the service of Queen Esther, tasked with communicating between Esther and Mordecai.

Similar prophetic urgency appears in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a> when Nathan conveys God&#8217;s word to David&#8212;truth spoken faithfully can redirect a nation&#8217;s future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Esther</b><p>&#8226; The queen receives the unfiltered counsel of a trusted relative, underscoring <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>, &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Mordecai appeals to Esther&#8217;s unique position, paralleling Joseph&#8217;s rise &#8220;for such a time&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.
