The king referred to is Ahasuerus, also known as Xerxes I, who ruled the Persian Empire from 486 to 465 BC. The timing is significant, as it occurs the night before Haman plans to execute Mordecai. The inability to sleep can be seen as divine intervention, a common theme in Scripture where God orchestrates events for His purposes (e.g., <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41:1-8</a>, <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>). This moment sets the stage for the reversal of fortunes for Mordecai and the Jewish people.<p><b>so he ordered the Book of Records, the Chronicles, to be brought in and read to him.</b><br>The Book of Records, the Chronicles, was a detailed account of the events and decrees of the Persian Empire. Such records were meticulously kept and served as a historical archive. The king's decision to have these records read to him is significant, as it leads to the discovery of Mordecai's earlier act of loyalty in saving the king from an assassination plot (<a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>). This act of reading the chronicles is a turning point in the story, demonstrating how God uses seemingly mundane events to fulfill His plans. The concept of records and books is also echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the Book of Life mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, symbolizing God's remembrance and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

"God Himself is here, though His name be absent." The king's sleepless night falls after the day when Haman has resolved to ask on the morrow for Mordecai's execution, a foretaste of the richer vengeance he hopes to wreak on the whole nation of the Jews. It is by a mere chance, one would say, looking at the matter simply in its human aspect, that the king should call for the book of the royal chronicles, and not for music. It was by a mere chance too. it might seem, that the reader should happen to light upon the record of Mordecai's services; and yet when all these apparent accidents are wrought up into the coincidence they make, how completely is the providence visible, the power that will use men as the instruments of its work, whether they know it, or know it not, whether they be willing or unwilling, whether the glory of God is to be manifested in and by and through them, or manifested on them only.<p><span class= "bld">They were read before the king.</span>--Canon Rawlinson remarks that there is reason to think that the Persian kings were in most cases unable to read.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The book of records of the chronicles</span>.
