In the ancient Persian Empire, the king's name carried immense power, and any decree issued under it was considered law. This reflects the cultural and political structure of the time, where the king's word was final. The empowerment of Mordecai to write on behalf of the king signifies a dramatic reversal of fortune for the Jews, who were previously under threat due to Haman's edict. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, showcasing God's providence and the theme of divine reversal, where the oppressed are elevated. It also parallels Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>), where he was given authority by Pharaoh to act in his name.<p><b>and seal it with the royal signet ring</b><br>The royal signet ring was a symbol of the king's authority and approval. In ancient times, documents were sealed with a signet ring to authenticate them, ensuring that they were genuine and carried the weight of the king's command. This practice is confirmed by archaeological findings of signet rings and seals from the Persian period. The use of the signet ring in this context underscores the irrevocable nature of the decree. It also reflects the biblical theme of sealing as a mark of ownership and authority, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, where believers are sealed with the Holy Spirit.<p><b>For a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the unchangeable nature of Persian law, as seen in the story of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8-15</a>), where the law of the Medes and Persians could not be altered. The irrevocability of the decree highlights the seriousness and finality of royal edicts in the Persian Empire. This cultural context adds tension to the narrative, as the Jews' survival depends on a new decree to counteract Haman's earlier one. Theologically, this reflects the concept of God's unchanging promises and the certainty of His word, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word accomplishes what He desires. The irrevocable nature of the king's decree also foreshadows the ultimate authority and finality of Christ's redemptive work, which cannot be undone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intervened to save her people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who played a crucial role in the events leading to the Jews' deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who granted Esther and Mordecai the authority to write a new decree.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist whose plot to annihilate the Jews was thwarted, leading to his downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persia.htm">Persia</a></b><br>The empire where these events took place, highlighting the Jews' precarious position in a foreign land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>Esther's role as an intercessor for her people is a powerful example of standing in the gap through prayer and action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>The events in Esther demonstrate God's unseen hand guiding and protecting His people, even when He is not explicitly mentioned.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_responsibility.htm">Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>With the authority given by the king, Esther and Mordecai had the responsibility to act wisely and justly, reminding us of the stewardship of our own God-given authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/irrevocable_decrees.htm">Irrevocable Decrees</a></b><br>The concept of an irrevocable decree parallels the certainty of God's promises, which are unchangeable and reliable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_adversity.htm">Courage in Adversity</a></b><br>Esther's courage in the face of potential death encourages believers to trust God and act boldly in difficult situations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_8_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_8_8_God_s_power_over_evil_decrees.htm">How does Esther 8:8 demonstrate God's sovereignty in reversing evil decrees?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Human_duty_in_Esther_8_8_s_decree.htm">What role does human responsibility play in Esther 8:8's "write in the king's name"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_providence_in_injustice.htm">How can we trust God's providence when facing unjust situations like in Esther 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Esther_8_8_Romans_8_28_on_God_s_plan.htm">How does Esther 8:8 connect with Romans 8:28 about God's plans for good?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_be_brave_like_Esther_for_justice.htm">In what ways can we act courageously like Esther when seeking justice today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Esther_8_8_Royal_decree_authority.htm">How does Esther 8:8 demonstrate the authority of royal decrees in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/King_s_signet_ring_s_role_in_Esther_8_8.htm">What is the significance of the king's signet ring in Esther 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Esther_8_8_God_s_providence_for_Jews.htm">How does Esther 8:8 reflect God's providence in the deliverance of the Jews?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_esther_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Esther 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/could_jews_kill_many_in_susa_in_one_day.htm">Esther 9:5&#8211;10: How plausible is it that the Jews could kill so many enemies in Susa in a single day without any recorded retaliation by the Persian authorities?

Such a writing "may no man reverse." Still he will do what he can. It may be possible to meet the difficulty, and save the Jews, without actual reversal of the decree. The king then refers to the proofs of his goodwill, as shown by hanging Haman for his scheme against the Jews, and giving his property to Esther, and bids Esther and Mordecai "write concerning the Jews according to what seems good in your eyes." Give, that is, any orders you please about them, short of repealing the former order. The result of this permission, whether the idea was suggested by the king, or occurred to Esther or Mordecai, was that authority was given to the Jews to defend themselves.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
