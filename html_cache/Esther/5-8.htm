This phrase echoes the biblical theme of finding favor, as seen in <a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a> where Joseph found favor in the eyes of Potiphar. Esther's request for favor is also reminiscent of the grace believers seek from God, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>.<p><b>and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request</b><br>Esther's careful wording shows her understanding of court protocol and the importance of aligning her desires with the king's pleasure. This reflects the wisdom and discernment she possesses, akin to the wisdom of Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>. The dual mention of "petition" and "request" emphasizes the gravity and importance of what she is about to ask, highlighting the seriousness of her mission to save her people.<p><b>may the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them</b><br>The invitation to a banquet is a strategic move by Esther, using hospitality to create a favorable setting for her request. Banquets were significant in Persian culture, often used for political and social purposes. This mirrors the use of feasts in biblical narratives, such as the wedding at Cana in <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2</a>, where significant events unfold. Esther's invitation also foreshadows the unfolding of God's providential plan, as the banquet becomes a pivotal moment in the story.<p><b>Then I will answer the king&#8217;s question.</b><br>Esther's promise to answer the king's question indicates her strategic patience and wisdom. She is setting the stage for a more opportune moment to reveal her true request. This reflects the biblical principle of timing and discernment, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. Esther's approach is a model of faith and courage, trusting in God's timing and provision, much like Jesus' deliberate timing in revealing His identity and mission throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia, who is strategically planning to save her people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king, who is unaware of Haman's plot against the Jews and is being approached by Esther.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist, a high-ranking official in the Persian empire, who has plotted to annihilate the Jews.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>A strategic event organized by Esther to reveal her petition to the king and expose Haman's plot.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_persian_empire.htm">The Persian Empire</a></b><br>The setting of the account, where the Jewish people are living in exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_preparation.htm">The Power of Preparation</a></b><br>Esther's careful planning and preparation for the banquet teach us the importance of being strategic and thoughtful in our actions, especially when facing significant challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_favor_with_god_and_man.htm">Seeking Favor with God and Man</a></b><br>Esther's request for favor from the king reflects the biblical principle of seeking favor from both God and man, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3-4</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_danger.htm">Courage in the Face of Danger</a></b><br>Esther's willingness to approach the king, despite the potential danger, encourages believers to act courageously when standing for righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timing.htm">The Importance of Timing</a></b><br>Esther's decision to delay her request until the second banquet underscores the importance of discerning the right timing in our decisions and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trusting in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Esther's account reminds us to trust in God's sovereign plan, even when we cannot see the outcome, knowing that He is working all things for good.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_5_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_5_8_Patience_in_God_s_timing.htm">How does Esther 5:8 demonstrate the importance of patience in God's timing?
