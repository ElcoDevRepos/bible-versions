Eunuchs often served as close advisors or attendants to royalty, indicating Harbonah's proximity to the king and his influence. This moment highlights the role of divine providence, as Harbonah's timely intervention contributes to the unfolding of justice. The mention of a eunuch also reflects the Persian Empire's administrative structure, where such individuals were often employed in high-ranking positions.<p><b>&#8220;There is a gallows fifty cubits high at Haman&#8217;s house.</b><br>The gallows, or more accurately a stake for impalement, is described as being fifty cubits high, approximately 75 feet. This extraordinary height signifies Haman's pride and his desire to make a public spectacle of Mordecai's execution. The location at Haman's house underscores his personal vendetta against Mordecai. The use of such a structure for execution was common in ancient Persia, intended to serve as a deterrent and a display of power.<p><b>He had it built for Mordecai,</b><br>Haman's intent to execute Mordecai on this gallows is a direct result of his anger and hatred towards Mordecai, who refused to bow to him. This reflects the theme of retribution and the reversal of fortunes, as Haman's plans for Mordecai ultimately lead to his own downfall. The narrative demonstrates the biblical principle that those who plot evil against others often fall into their own traps (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>).<p><b>who gave the report that saved the king.&#8221;</b><br>Mordecai's earlier act of loyalty in uncovering a plot against King Xerxes is crucial to the story. This act of faithfulness is rewarded, aligning with the biblical theme of divine justice and protection for those who honor God. Mordecai's report is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for the king's favor towards him, contrasting with Haman's treachery.<p><b>&#8220;Hang him on it!&#8221; declared the king.</b><br>The king's swift decision to execute Haman on the very gallows intended for Mordecai illustrates the theme of poetic justice. This moment is a turning point in the narrative, where the wicked are punished, and the righteous are vindicated. It reflects the biblical assurance that God will ultimately bring justice and that the plans of the wicked will not prevail (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>).

Thus not only does God vouchsafe to deliver his people, but He brings on the enemy the very destruction he had devised for his adversary: "He hath fallen himself into the pit that he digged for other." Our Saviour has rescued us from our enemy who was too mighty for us, and has trodden down our foe, to be destroyed for ever in His own good time. So may we Christians see in the dangers threatening the Jews throughout this book a picture of our own, and in Haman's discomfiture a type of the victory of the Lamb over sin and Satan.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king</span>.
