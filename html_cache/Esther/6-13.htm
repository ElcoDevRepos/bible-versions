This moment follows a series of events where Haman's plans to honor himself are thwarted, and instead, he is forced to honor Mordecai, a Jew he despises. The sharing of his misfortunes highlights the communal nature of decision-making and support in ancient societies. It also sets the stage for the unfolding of divine justice, as Haman's pride and hatred lead to his downfall.<p><b>His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him,</b><br>Zeresh and the advisers represent the voices of reason and prophecy in this narrative. Their response to Haman is significant as it contrasts with their earlier encouragement of his plot against Mordecai. This shift indicates a recognition of a higher power at work, as they begin to see the futility of opposing God's chosen people. The mention of advisers also underscores the importance of counsel in leadership, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>&#8220;Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is Jewish,</b><br>The identification of Mordecai as Jewish is crucial, as it ties into the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with Israel. The Jewish identity of Mordecai is not just an ethnic marker but a spiritual one, signifying his connection to God's promises and protection. This acknowledgment by Haman's advisers suggests an awareness of the historical pattern of God's deliverance of the Jews, as seen in stories like the Exodus. It also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's people, a recurring theme in biblical prophecy.<p><b>you will not prevail against him&#8212;for surely you will fall before him.&#8221;</b><br>This statement serves as a prophetic declaration of Haman's impending defeat. It echoes the biblical principle that those who oppose God's people ultimately face ruin, as seen in the stories of Pharaoh, Goliath, and others. The phrase "you will not prevail" aligns with the scriptural assurance that God fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The certainty of Haman's fall is a testament to the sovereignty of God and His ability to turn the plans of the wicked to fulfill His purposes.

Nothing of this comfort could be Hainan's. He had' not failed in an honest discharge of his duty, but in a cruel and unjust scheme (not that the king can be called a whit better in this matter); he knew the usages of his country far too well to suppose for a moment that, after having made such an attempt, and having failed, he would be allowed to try a second time.<p><span class= "bld">If Mordecai . . . before whom thou hast begun</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Poor comfort does the unfortunate schemer get from his household; he knew too well already that he had <span class= "ital">begun</span> to fall, his heart must have told him all too truly that it was but the beginning: what then could he expect from this communication to his family?
