The gallows, likely a tall wooden structure, was intended for Mordecai, a Jew who refused to bow to Haman. This reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution, where God turns the plans of the wicked against them, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, "Whoever digs a pit will fall into it." The historical context shows the Persian Empire's use of impalement or hanging as a form of execution, emphasizing the severity of Haman's punishment. This event also underscores the protection and providence of God over His people, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>Then the fury of the king subsided.</b><br>King Ahasuerus's anger was initially kindled by Haman's plot to annihilate the Jews, which included his queen, Esther. The king's fury represents the righteous indignation against injustice and the betrayal of trust. The subsiding of his anger signifies the restoration of justice and order within the kingdom. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where justice is served, and peace is restored. The king's change of heart also reflects the biblical theme of repentance and forgiveness, as seen in the broader narrative of Scripture, where God's wrath is turned away through acts of justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire who plotted to annihilate the Jews.

God&#8217;s own wrath against sin is satisfied at the cross (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>), providing peace for all who trust Him (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a> showcases God&#8217;s precise, poetic justice: the plotter is destroyed by his own scheme, God&#8217;s people are preserved, and rightful anger is calmed.
