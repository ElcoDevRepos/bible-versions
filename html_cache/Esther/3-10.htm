In ancient Persia, the king's signet ring was used to seal official documents, signifying the king's approval and making the decree irrevocable. This act of removing the ring and giving it to another person was a significant transfer of authority. In the biblical context, it shows the king's trust in Haman and his willingness to delegate significant power to him. This act is reminiscent of Pharaoh giving his signet ring to Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>, symbolizing a similar transfer of authority.<p><b>and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite</b><br>Haman is identified as the son of Hammedatha and an Agagite. The term "Agagite" is significant because Agag was a king of the Amalekites, a people who were long-standing enemies of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>). This connection suggests a historical enmity between Haman and the Jewish people, adding depth to his role as an antagonist in the story. The Amalekites were descendants of Esau, and their conflict with Israel is rooted in the ancient struggle between Jacob and Esau. This background sets the stage for the tension and conflict that unfolds in the Book of Esther.<p><b>the enemy of the Jews</b><br>Haman's designation as "the enemy of the Jews" highlights his role as the primary antagonist in the narrative. This enmity is not just personal but is rooted in historical and ethnic animosity. The Jews, as God's chosen people, often faced opposition from surrounding nations, and Haman's plot to destroy them is a continuation of this theme. This phrase also foreshadows the coming conflict and the deliverance that God will provide through Esther and Mordecai. The theme of enmity against God's people is echoed throughout Scripture, with ultimate deliverance and victory found in Jesus Christ, who overcomes all enemies of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over a vast empire.

He knew exactly what he was doing&#8212;even if he did not grasp the full consequences.<p>&#8211; Scripture records the event as fact, reminding us that earthly rulers often hand over authority without discerning how it will be used (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: Positions and symbols of influence can be misused when separated from godly wisdom and accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite</b><p>&#8211; Handing the ring to Haman granted him unchecked legislative and financial control (<a href="/esther/3-11.htm">Esther 3:11</a>; 8:2).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Agagite&#8221; links Haman to Agag, king of the Amalekites&#8212;Israel&#8217;s ancient foe (<a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>). The text signals that old enmities are resurfacing in a new generation.<p>&#8211; Haman did not seize power; the king bestowed it. That detail underscores how evil often advances through official channels when leaders abdicate moral responsibility (<a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3&#8211;4</a> warns rulers to reward good and punish evil).<p>&#8211; For believers, this scene cautions us to vet counselors and delegate authority wisely (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; 25:5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the enemy of the Jews</b><p>&#8211; Scripture labels Haman upfront: &#8220;the enemy.&#8221; The Spirit wants readers to feel the threat before the plot unfolds (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>).<p>&#8211; The title recalls other foes who tried to eradicate God&#8217;s people&#8212;Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15&#8211;17</a>), the Midianites (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1&#8211;6</a>), and later Antiochus IV (<a href="/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>).
