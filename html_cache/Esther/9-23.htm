The custom refers to the celebration of Purim, which commemorates their deliverance from Haman's plot to annihilate them. This decision reflects a common biblical theme where significant events are memorialized through festivals or rituals, similar to the Passover instituted in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. The agreement among the Jews signifies unity and a shared commitment to remember God's deliverance.<p><b>as Mordecai had written to them</b><br>Mordecai, a central figure in the Book of Esther, is portrayed as a wise and influential leader. His role in writing to the Jews underscores his authority and the respect he commanded among his people. This act of writing can be seen as a formalization of the Purim celebration, ensuring its observance for future generations. The written word in biblical times was a powerful tool for communication and preservation of tradition, as seen in other scriptural instances like the giving of the Law to Moses. Mordecai's involvement also points to the providential role he played in the deliverance of the Jews, a type of Christ who intercedes and secures salvation for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The Jewish people living in the Persian Empire who were under threat of annihilation due to Haman's plot but were delivered through the intervention of Queen Esther and Mordecai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew in the Persian Empire, cousin and guardian of Esther, who played a crucial role in the deliverance of the Jews and the establishment of the Feast of Purim.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_purim.htm">Feast of Purim</a></b><br>A Jewish festival established to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's plot, as recorded in the Book of Esther.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/persian_empire.htm">Persian Empire</a></b><br>The setting of the Book of Esther, where the events took place under the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist in the Book of Esther, whose plot to destroy the Jews was thwarted, leading to his downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Just as the Jews established Purim to remember their deliverance, Christians are called to remember God's faithfulness and deliverance in their own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_providence.htm">God's Sovereignty and Providence</a></b><br>The account of Esther highlights God's unseen hand in orchestrating events for His people's good, reminding believers to trust in His sovereign plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience_and_action.htm">The Role of Obedience and Action</a></b><br>Mordecai's leadership and the Jews' agreement to continue the custom demonstrate the importance of obedience and action in response to God's deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_celebration.htm">Community and Celebration</a></b><br>The establishment of Purim emphasizes the value of community and collective celebration in remembering God's works.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/standing_firm_in_faith.htm">Standing Firm in Faith</a></b><br>The Jews' decision to continue the custom reflects their commitment to their faith and identity, encouraging believers to stand firm in their faith amidst challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_9_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 9:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_s_deliverance_today_2.htm">How can we "establish and adopt" traditions that honor God's deliverance today?
