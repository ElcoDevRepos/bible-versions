In the ancient Persian Empire, couriers were essential for communication across vast distances. The haste indicates the importance of the decree, which was to counteract the previous edict against the Jews. This urgency can be compared to the swift spread of the Gospel in the New Testament, where the message of salvation was carried quickly to various regions (<a href="/acts/13-49.htm">Acts 13:49</a>).<p><b>on their royal horses</b><br>Royal horses signify the authority and resources of the Persian Empire. These horses were likely of the finest breed, symbolizing the power and prestige of the king's command. The use of royal horses underscores the official and authoritative nature of the decree. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a type of divine provision and authority, reminiscent of the white horse in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, which represents Christ's victorious return.<p><b>pressed on by the command of the king</b><br>The king's command was the driving force behind the couriers' mission. This reflects the absolute authority of the Persian monarchs, whose decrees were irrevocable (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>). The king's command here is a reversal of Haman's earlier edict, showcasing the providential hand of God in protecting His people. This mirrors the ultimate authority of Christ, who commands His followers to spread the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>).<p><b>And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, was a significant location for the administration of royal decrees. The citadel was the center of power and governance. Issuing the edict in Susa ensured that it would be disseminated throughout the empire. This highlights the central role of Susa in the narrative of Esther and the historical context of the Persian Empire. The citadel's prominence is akin to Jerusalem's role in biblical history as a center of spiritual and political significance (<a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/couriers.htm">Couriers</a></b><br>These were messengers tasked with delivering the king's decrees swiftly across the empire.

It appears that the later posts were urged to haste still more strongly than the earlier ones - not that time really pressed, but from superabundant caution - that there might be an opportunity for further communications between the provinces and the court, if doubt was anywhere entertained as to the king's intentions. MORDECAI'S HONOUR AND THE JEWS' JOY (<a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15-17</a>). Ahasuerus was not content even now with what he had done for Mordecai. Before his minister quitted the presence, the king presented him with a crown of gold, and a robe and vest of honour; and thus arrayed he proceeded into the city of Susa, where the new edict was already known, and had been received with satisfaction (ver. 15). The Persians, who formed the predominant element in the population of the town, sympathised with the Jews, and rejoiced in the king's favour towards them; while the Jews of Susa, having passed from despair to confident hope, were full of gladness and thankfulness. In the provinces the decree had a still warmer welcome. Its arrival was celebrated with "a feast" (ver. 17) and "a good day." It led also to many of the heathen becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion - some perhaps from conviction, but others because they thought it safer to place themselves manifestly on the Jews' side before the day of the struggle: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/8-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The couriers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
