This echoes the biblical principle of remembering God's deliverance, as seen in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). Celebrations serve as a means to pass down faith and history, ensuring that God's acts are not forgotten.<p><b>by every generation, family, province, and city</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal nature of the observance within the Jewish community. It underscores the unity and continuity of the Jewish people, regardless of geographical location. The inclusion of "every generation" ensures that the story of Esther and the deliverance of the Jews is perpetuated through time, similar to the instructions given for the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24-27</a>).<p><b>so that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews</b><br>Purim, established in the Book of Esther, is a festival of joy and thanksgiving for the deliverance from Haman's plot. The observance of Purim is a testament to God's providence and protection, even when His name is not explicitly mentioned in the text. This reflects the theme of divine sovereignty and hidden intervention.<p><b>nor should the memory of them fade from their descendants</b><br>The emphasis on memory ensures that future generations understand their heritage and the faithfulness of God. This is akin to the stones set up by Joshua as a memorial for crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).

Mordecai had no ecclesiastical authority; and it might have been expected that the Jews of Jerusalem would have demurred to the imposition of a fresh religious obligation upon them by a Jew of the Dispersion, who was neither a prophet, nor a priest, nor even a Levite. The Jews of Jerusalem, in their strongly-situated city, which was wholly theirs, and with their temple-fortress complete (<a href="/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>), can scarcely have felt themselves in much danger from an attack which was to have begun and ended in a day. But Joiakim, the high priest of the time (<a href="/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10-12</a>), to whom, as we have seen ('Introduction,' &sect; 3), the Book of Esther was attributed by some, must have given his approval to the feast from the first, and have adopted it into the ceremonial of the nation, or it would scarcely have become universal. Hooker ('Eccl. Pol.,' 5:71, &sect; 6) rightly makes the establishment of the feast an argument in favour of the Church's power to prescribe festival days; and it must certainly have been by ecclesiastical, and not by civil, command that it became obligatory. <span class="cmt_word">That these days... should not fail,... nor the memorial of them perish</span>. As a commemoration of human, and not of Divine, appointment, the feast of Purim was liable to abrogation or discontinuance. The Jews of the time resolved that the observance should be perpetual; and in point of fact the feast has continued up to the present date, and is likely to continue, though they could not bind their successors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/9-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1440;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
