This event occurs during the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), around 486-465 BC. The decree against the Jews is a result of Haman's hatred for Mordecai, who refused to bow to him. This reflects the ongoing tension between the descendants of King Saul (Mordecai) and the Amalekites (Haman), as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<p><b>he tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes is a traditional Jewish expression of grief and mourning, seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>). It signifies deep sorrow and distress, often in response to death or calamity. Mordecai's actions indicate the severity of the threat against the Jewish people.<p><b>put on sackcloth and ashes</b><br>Sackcloth, a coarse material, and ashes are symbols of mourning and repentance. This practice is common in the ancient Near East and is used by individuals seeking God's mercy (e.g., <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>). Mordecai's donning of sackcloth and ashes underscores his desperation and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>and went out into the middle of the city</b><br>Mordecai's public display of mourning in the city center is significant. It draws attention to the plight of the Jews and serves as a call to action. The city, likely Susa, the Persian capital, is a place of political and social activity, making Mordecai's actions more visible and impactful.<p><b>wailing loudly and bitterly</b><br>The loud and bitter wailing is a profound expression of grief and urgency. This public lamentation is not only a personal response but also a communal call for the Jewish people to recognize the impending danger. It echoes the cries of other biblical figures in times of distress (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>, <a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>). Mordecai's actions foreshadow the intercessory role of Christ, who also mourns over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire.

Each action testifies to genuine grief, communal solidarity, and humble dependence on God&#8212;preparing the stage for divine deliverance that will soon unfold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Mordecai rent</span> <span class= "bld">his clothes.</span>--This was a common sign of sorrow among Eastern nations generally. It will be noticed that the sorrow both of Mordecai and of the Jews generally (<a href="/esther/4-3.htm" title="And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.">Esther 4:3</a>) is described by external manifestations solely. There is rending of garments, putting on of sackcloth and ashes, fasting and weeping and wailing: there is nothing said of prayer and entreaty to the God of Israel, and strong crying to Him who is able to save. Daniel and Ezra and Nehemiah are all Jews, who, like Mordecai and Esther, have to submit to the rule of the alien, though, unlike them, they, when the danger threatened, besought, and not in vain, the help of their God. (See <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-23.htm" title="So we fasted and sought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,">Nehemiah 1:4</a>, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mordecai rent his clothes</span>.

The palace was not to be saddened by private griefs (see the next verse). Mordecai, therefore, having assumed the outward signs of extreme sorrow, quitted the palace, and entered the streets of the town.
