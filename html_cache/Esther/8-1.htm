It underscores the swift justice and reversal of fortune that occurs in the narrative. The timing is significant, as it shows the urgency and decisiveness of the king's actions in response to Esther's plea.<p><b>King Xerxes awarded Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews.</b><br>The transfer of Haman's estate to Esther is a significant act of restitution and justice. In ancient Persian culture, the property of a traitor or condemned person often reverted to the crown, and the king could redistribute it as he saw fit. This act not only compensates Esther but also symbolizes the complete reversal of Haman's evil plans. Haman, who sought to destroy the Jews, is now posthumously stripped of his wealth and power, which is given to a Jewess, Esther. This mirrors the biblical theme of the righteous being rewarded and the wicked being punished, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, "A sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous."<p><b>And Mordecai entered the king&#8217;s presence</b><br>Mordecai's entrance into the king's presence signifies his rise in status and favor. Previously, Mordecai had been a lowly gatekeeper, but his loyalty and wisdom have now been recognized. This elevation is reminiscent of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-43</a>), where a faithful servant of God is exalted to a position of influence and authority.<p><b>because Esther had revealed his relation to her.</b><br>Esther's revelation of her relationship to Mordecai is a pivotal moment. It highlights the importance of identity and kinship in the narrative. By revealing Mordecai as her cousin and adoptive father, Esther secures his safety and elevates his status. This disclosure also strengthens the bond between Esther and the king, as it shows her trust and transparency. The revelation is a turning point that leads to the further protection and elevation of the Jewish people, aligning with God's providential care for His chosen people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
