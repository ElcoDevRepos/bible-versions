Wine was often consumed during these gatherings, symbolizing celebration and the king's favor. The setting of a banquet indicates a moment of potential influence and decision-making. Esther's strategic use of a banquet to approach the king reflects her wisdom and understanding of court customs.<p><b>the king said to Esther</b><br>King Ahasuerus, also known as Xerxes I, was the ruler of the Persian Empire. His relationship with Esther, his queen, is central to the narrative. Esther's position as queen gives her unique access to the king, yet she must navigate the risks associated with approaching him without being summoned, as seen earlier in the story.<p><b>What is your petition?</b><br>The king's question indicates his willingness to listen and respond to Esther's needs. In the context of the narrative, Esther's petition is crucial for the survival of her people, the Jews. This moment highlights the theme of divine providence, as Esther is positioned to intercede on behalf of her people.<p><b>It will be given to you.</b><br>The king's assurance suggests a readiness to grant Esther's request, demonstrating his favor towards her. This reflects the cultural practice of kings granting requests during banquets, a time when they were more inclined to generosity.<p><b>What is your request?</b><br>The repetition of the question emphasizes the king's openness and eagerness to fulfill Esther's desires. It also builds suspense in the narrative, as the reader anticipates Esther's response and the unfolding of her plan.<p><b>Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.</b><br>This hyperbolic expression was a common royal idiom, indicating the king's extreme generosity and willingness to grant significant requests. It is not meant to be taken literally but underscores the king's favor towards Esther. This phrase is reminiscent of Herod's offer to Herodias' daughter in <a href="/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>, illustrating a similar cultural expression of royal benevolence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia, who is courageous and wise.
