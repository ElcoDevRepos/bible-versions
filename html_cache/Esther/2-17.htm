In the context of the Persian Empire, where kings often had large harems, Esther's selection is significant. Her beauty and character set her apart, reflecting God's providential hand. This mirrors the biblical theme of God elevating the humble, as seen with Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>) and David being chosen as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>).<p><b>and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all of the other virgins</b><br>The terms "grace" and "favor" suggest divine intervention, as these words often indicate God's blessing in Scripture. Esther's favor with the king can be compared to Joseph's favor with Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>). This favor is not merely human attraction but a divinely orchestrated plan for the preservation of the Jewish people, foreshadowing the grace believers find in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>).<p><b>So he placed the royal crown upon her head</b><br>The act of crowning Esther signifies her official status as queen. This moment is pivotal, as it positions Esther to influence the king and protect her people. The crown symbolizes authority and responsibility, akin to the believer's future reign with Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>). Archaeological findings from the Persian period, such as reliefs and inscriptions, depict the grandeur of royal ceremonies, underscoring the significance of this event.<p><b>and made her queen in place of Vashti</b><br>Vashti's removal and Esther's ascension highlight themes of divine sovereignty and the reversal of fortunes. Vashti's refusal to appear before the king (<a href="/esther/1-12.htm">Esther 1:12</a>) led to her deposition, making way for Esther. This reflects the biblical principle that God raises and removes leaders according to His purposes (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). Esther's rise prefigures Christ's exaltation after His humility (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>), emphasizing God's redemptive plan through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who becomes queen of Persia.
