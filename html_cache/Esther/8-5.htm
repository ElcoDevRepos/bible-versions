Esther's approach is strategic, acknowledging the king's authority and seeking his goodwill. This mirrors the cultural norms of ancient Persia, where subjects had to approach the king with humility and deference. It also highlights Esther's wisdom and tact in navigating the political landscape.<p><b>"and if I have found favor in his sight,"</b><br>Finding favor in the king's sight is crucial for Esther's request. This phrase underscores the importance of personal relationships and favor in ancient Near Eastern courts. Esther's favor with the king is a recurring theme, as seen earlier when she was chosen as queen (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>). It also reflects the biblical theme of divine favor, as seen in figures like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>).<p><b>"and the matter seems proper to the king,"</b><br>Esther appeals to the king's sense of justice and propriety. This phrase suggests that the king's decision should align with what is right and just. It reflects the biblical principle of justice, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>, which emphasizes doing what is right and just as more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.<p><b>"and I am pleasing in his sight,"</b><br>Reiterating her favor with the king, Esther emphasizes her personal relationship with him. This phrase highlights the importance of personal influence in achieving political goals. It also reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where individuals like Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>) use their relationship with God to intercede for others.<p><b>"may an order be written to revoke the letters"</b><br>Esther requests a formal decree to counteract Haman's edict. This reflects the irreversible nature of Persian laws, as seen in <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>, where laws once written could not be altered. Esther's request for a new decree shows her understanding of the legal system and her strategic thinking.<p><b>"that the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, wrote"</b><br>Haman is identified as an Agagite, linking him to the Amalekites, ancient enemies of Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). This connection highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and Amalek, fulfilling the prophecy of enmity between the two nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). Haman's scheming nature is a reminder of the spiritual battle against evil, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>"to destroy the Jews in all the king&#8217;s provinces."</b><br>The threat against the Jews is a central theme in Esther, reflecting the historical reality of anti-Semitism. The widespread nature of the decree highlights the vastness of the Persian Empire, which stretched from India to Ethiopia (<a href="/esther/1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). This phrase underscores the vulnerability of the Jewish people and the need for divine intervention, as seen in God's promises to protect Israel (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intercedes for her people.

Scripture repeatedly affirms that earthly rulers receive their authority from above (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). By honoring the king, Esther mirrors Daniel&#8217;s respectful petitions before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>) and Nehemiah&#8217;s request to Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm">Nehemiah 2:3-5</a>). Her respectful tone also fulfills <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Respect recognizes God&#8217;s sovereignty behind human authority.<p>&#8226; A humble approach opens doors for righteous action (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if I have found favor in his sight</b><p>Esther appeals to the personal grace she has already received (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>). The Hebrew idea of &#8220;favor&#8221; parallels the New Testament concept of grace; it is granted, not earned (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>; <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). Esther&#8217;s life displays <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3-4</a>: &#8220;Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man&#8221;.<p>&#8226; God grants favor to advance His redemptive plans (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Human favor often signals divine favor working behind the scenes (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the matter seems proper to the king</b><p>Esther submits the moral judgment to Xerxes, trusting God to guide the king&#8217;s heart (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). She is not demanding; she is inviting the king to own the righteousness of the cause, much like Moses appealed to Pharaoh for what was &#8220;proper&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-29.htm">Exodus 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Righteous causes can be presented as reasonable, not merely emotional (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Wise leaders love upright speech (<a href="/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I am pleasing in his sight</b><p>The repetition stresses relationship.

In Persia, written decrees were powerful (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>), yet she believes even an irrevocable edict can be countered by the king&#8217;s greater authority. The scene foreshadows the gospel: Christ &#8220;canceled the record of debt that stood against us&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Wicked decrees can be overturned by righteous authority (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God delights in turning death sentences into deliverance (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, wrote</b><p>Haman&#8217;s lineage traces back to Agag, king of the Amalekites, perpetual enemies of Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>). Esther names the evil, exposing the plot and its source (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>). By calling him &#8220;scheming,&#8221; she underscores <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, where the Lord hates hands that shed innocent blood.<p>&#8226; Identifying the enemy clarifies the battle (<a href="/psalms/140-1.htm">Psalm 140:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; God remembers ancient hostility against His covenant people and will judge it (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to destroy the Jews in all the king&#8217;s provinces</b><p>The threat is total genocide, yet God&#8217;s covenant promises make Israel indestructible (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-36</a>). Esther stands in the gap, embodying <a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>, &#8220;Rescue those being led away to death.&#8221; Her plea anticipates later deliverances, such as the survival of the exiles under Ezra and Nehemiah, and ultimately points to the Messiah through whom the Jewish people would bless the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Satanic agendas aim to erase God&#8217;s redemptive line, but cannot succeed (<a href="/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; God preserves His people even in exile, proving His faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/8-5.htm">Esther 8:5</a> reveals a courageous, faith-filled queen who respectfully petitions a pagan king for the salvation of her people. Each phrase blends humility, favor, moral clarity, and boldness. God&#8217;s sovereignty, human responsibility, and covenant faithfulness converge: Esther honors authority, appeals to grace, exposes evil, and seeks legal reversal, while the Lord positions her to secure His people&#8217;s survival and advance His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">To reverse.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">to bring back, to recall.</span> Esther shows considerable skill in wording her request.
