This system is reminiscent of the "pony express" and underscores the urgency and authority of the king's decree. The king's command reflects the absolute power of Persian monarchs, who were often seen as divine or semi-divine figures. This mirrors the authority of God&#8217;s word, which is also sent out with purpose and power (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa, one of the Persian Empire's capitals, was a significant center of political power. Archaeological findings have confirmed its grandeur and importance. The citadel, a fortified area, was the heart of administrative activities. The issuing of the edict here signifies the formal and official nature of the decree. This setting contrasts with the hidden and vulnerable position of the Jewish people, who were the targets of the edict, reminiscent of the spiritual battles faced by believers (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>Then the king and Haman sat down to drink</b><br>This phrase illustrates the callousness and indifference of the king and Haman to the suffering their decree would cause. It reflects a theme of moral blindness and self-indulgence, often criticized in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4-5</a>). The act of sitting down to drink symbolizes a false sense of security and peace, contrasting with the impending doom for the Jews. This can be seen as a type of the world's fleeting pleasures, which stand in stark contrast to the eternal joy found in Christ (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p><b>but the city of Susa was in confusion</b><br>The confusion in Susa indicates the widespread impact and the unsettling nature of the edict. It suggests that not all Persians were in agreement with or understood the king's decree, highlighting the potential for injustice when power is misused. This confusion can be compared to the spiritual confusion in the world without the light of Christ (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). The reaction of the city foreshadows the eventual deliverance and reversal of fortunes for the Jews, a theme of divine providence and justice seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over a vast empire and issued the edict against the Jews, influenced by Haman.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist in the Book of Esther, who plotted to destroy the Jews due to his hatred for Mordecai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, cousin and guardian of Esther, who refused to bow to Haman, inciting Haman's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia, who would later play a crucial role in saving her people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa (Shushan)</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire, where the events of the Book of Esther take place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_influence.htm">The Power of Influence</a></b><br>Haman's influence over King Ahasuerus shows how one person's malice can affect an entire nation.

The haste underlines the seriousness of Haman&#8217;s plot&#8212;no time is allowed for debate or appeal.<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that earthly power can spread evil quickly, yet God remains sovereign (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa</b><p>&#8226;

Though there was ample time, since the remotest part of the empire could be reached in a month, or two at the most, yet the posts were "hastened," Haman being impatient, lest the king should change his mind, and decline to publish the edict. The king may himself also have wished to have the matter settled past recall<span class="cmt_word">. The king sat down with Haman to drink.</span> This touch seems intended to mark their hardness of heart. As Nero "fiddled while Rome was burning," so these two, having assigned a nation to destruction, proceeded to enjoy themselves at "a banquet of wine." <span class="cmt_word">But the city of Susa was perplexed</span>. The Jews had enemies in Susa (<a href="/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>); but the bulk of the inhabitants being Persians, and so Zoroastrians, would be likely to sympathise with them. There might also be a widespread feeling among persons of other nationalities that the precedent now set was a dangerous one. Generally the people of the capital approved and applauded what. ever the great king did. Now they misdoubted the justice, and perhaps even the prudence, of what was resolved upon. The decree threw them into perplexity. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The couriers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
