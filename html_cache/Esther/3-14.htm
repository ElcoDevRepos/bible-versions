In the ancient Persian Empire, written edicts were a common method of communication and governance, often inscribed on clay tablets or papyrus. The use of written decrees ensured that the king's commands were preserved and could be referenced as authoritative. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the book of Daniel, where decrees were also issued by the king (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8-9</a>).<p><b>was to be issued in every province</b><br>The Persian Empire was vast, stretching from India to Ethiopia, comprising 127 provinces (<a href="/esther/1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). The issuance of the edict in every province highlights the extensive reach and centralized power of the Persian administration. This also underscores the seriousness of the decree, as it was meant to affect the entire empire. The logistical challenge of disseminating such an edict across diverse regions with different languages and cultures is significant, reflecting the empire's sophisticated communication network.<p><b>and published to all the people</b><br>The publication of the edict to all the people indicates the intent for widespread awareness and compliance. In the Persian Empire, public announcements were often made in the city gates or public squares, where people gathered. This ensured that the decree reached not only the local officials but also the general populace. The public nature of the announcement is reminiscent of other biblical instances where proclamations were made to ensure communal knowledge and response, such as the reading of the Law in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>.<p><b>so that they would be ready on that day</b><br>This phrase implies a specific day set for the execution of the edict, which in this context was the planned annihilation of the Jewish people (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>). The preparation for a future event is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with divine judgment or deliverance. The call to readiness can be seen as a parallel to the eschatological themes in the New Testament, where believers are urged to be prepared for the return of Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>). The urgency and gravity of the edict in Esther foreshadow the ultimate deliverance that God provides through His providence, as seen later in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

This underlines the unchangeable nature of the royal decree, echoing other written mandates in Persia (<a href="/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>, <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8-9</a>). In Scripture, writing gives authority and permanence&#8212;think of the tablets in <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a> or Josiah&#8217;s rediscovered Book of the Law in <a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>. Here, the written form shows that Haman&#8217;s evil plot is no rumor; it is official, binding, and deadly serious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was to be issued in every province</b><p>Persia&#8217;s empire stretched &#8220;from India to Cush, 127 provinces&#8221; (<a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). The wording spotlights the total reach of the threat; no pocket of safety exists. Compare Caesar&#8217;s census that &#8220;went out to all the world&#8221; in <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>, or King Artaxerxes&#8217; letters sent &#8220;to all the treasurers of the province beyond the River&#8221; in <a href="/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>. When earthly power speaks, it wants universal compliance&#8212;yet the episode reminds us that God still overrules (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and published to all the people</b><p>Nothing about the decree is hidden. Like Jonah&#8217;s warning shouted through Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4-5</a>) or Moses&#8217; instructions read &#8220;in the hearing of all Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11-12</a>), this proclamation targets every ear, Jew or Gentile. Evil often announces itself brazenly; the enemy is unashamed to broadcast destruction (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Yet God&#8217;s good news is even more public&#8212;as seen later when the Jews&#8217; deliverance is likewise &#8220;proclaimed in every province&#8221; (<a href="/esther/8-13.htm">Esther 8:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they would be ready on that day</b><p>The phrase stresses urgency and preparation&#8212;though for wicked ends. <a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a> required Israel to eat the Passover &#8220;in haste&#8230;ready to go,&#8221; and Jesus tells His disciples, &#8220;You also must be ready&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>). Here the readiness is flipped: pagans prepare to exterminate God&#8217;s people, not realizing they are positioning themselves for divine reversal (<a href="/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14-16</a>). The verse foreshadows the reality that everyone is preparing for something&#8212;either for judgment or for salvation (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/3-14.htm">Esther 3:14</a> records a grim, all-encompassing, and publicly proclaimed edict designed to mobilize an empire against God&#8217;s covenant people. The verse underscores how evil wields written authority, broad distribution, and urgency to advance its plans. Yet the wider narrative proves that God can turn even the most thoroughly communicated schemes on their heads, protecting His own and transforming looming tragedy into triumph.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Copy.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">pathshegen.</span> A Persian word, only occurring here and in <a href="/esther/4-8.htm" title="Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.">Esther 4:8</a>; <a href="/esther/8-13.htm" title="The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published to all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.">Esther 8:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The exact import of this verse is uncertain.
