His inquiry demonstrates the importance of royal favor and recognition in the Persian court. The king's question is prompted by a sleepless night and the reading of the chronicles, which is a divine orchestration in the narrative. This moment underscores the theme of God's providence, as the king's inquiry sets in motion the events leading to the deliverance of the Jewish people.<p><b>&#8220;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?&#8221;</b><br>Mordecai's act refers to his earlier revelation of a plot to assassinate the king, which is recorded in <a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>. The king's question about honor and dignity reflects the Persian custom of rewarding loyalty and service, which was crucial for maintaining the stability of the empire. This moment is pivotal, as it contrasts with Haman's plot to destroy the Jews, highlighting the theme of justice and retribution. The inquiry also foreshadows the reversal of fortunes that Mordecai will experience, a common motif in biblical narratives.<p><b>&#8220;Nothing has been done for him,&#8221;</b><br>The attendants' response indicates a lapse in the royal system of rewards, which is unusual given the importance of such acts in Persian culture. This oversight is significant in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Mordecai's eventual elevation. The delay in recognition serves as a reminder of God's timing and sovereignty, as seen in other biblical stories where divine intervention occurs at the perfect moment, such as Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (Genesis 41).<p><b>replied the king&#8217;s attendants.</b><br>The attendants play a crucial role in the Persian court, acting as intermediaries between the king and his subjects. Their reply highlights the bureaucratic nature of the empire and the reliance on records and reports. This interaction emphasizes the theme of human agency within divine providence, as the attendants' response contributes to the unfolding of God's plan for the Jewish people. The narrative demonstrates how God uses ordinary means and people to achieve His purposes, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Like Pharaoh seeking Joseph&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>), rulers can suddenly recognize hidden servants when God prompts them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The act refers to Mordecai&#8217;s exposure of the assassination plot recorded in <a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>. Scripture consistently teaches that righteous deeds deserve public commendation (<a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-14.htm">1 Peter 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Honor or dignity&#8221; hints at more than thanks&#8212;royal recognition, gifts, perhaps promotion (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a> for Joseph; <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a> for Daniel). God often orchestrates delayed reward so that it arrives at the perfect redemptive moment (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing is critical: Haman is en route to seek Mordecai&#8217;s execution (<a href="/esther/6-4.htm">Esther 6:4-5</a>).

Delay magnifies glory: Mordecai receives public honor precisely when his life is threatened, mirroring Joseph&#8217;s rise from prison (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14-16</a>) and David&#8217;s vindication after Saul&#8217;s pursuit (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores a biblical theme: humility precedes exaltation (<a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>; <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>); God&#8217;s purposes never falter though men overlook faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a> shows God prompting a pagan king to recognize an overlooked act of loyalty at the exact hour it will rescue God&#8217;s people. Mordecai&#8217;s forgotten faithfulness becomes the catalyst for honor, while Haman&#8217;s scheme unravels. The verse assures believers that the Lord sees every hidden deed and, in His precise timing, brings just reward and protection, turning potential evil into blessing for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">What honour and dignity hath been done.</span>--The names of those who were thought worthy of being accounted "royal benefactors" were enrolled on a special list, and they were supposed to be suitably rewarded, though not necessarily at the time.

In Persia, where "royal benefactors" formed a distinct class, and had their names inscribed on a special list (Herod., 8:85), it was especially incumbent on the monarch to see that every such person received a return proportioned to the value of his service. Ahasuerus seems to have supposed that some honour or dignity must have been conferred upon Mordecai, though he could not recollect what it was; and it is difficult to understand how the omission to reward him had occurred, unless there was a prejudice against him among the high court officials, who may have known that he was a Jew, though his fellow-servants did not (<a href="/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
