The "appointed time" refers to the specific days set aside annually to commemorate this event, which are the 14th and 15th of Adar. This reflects the Jewish tradition of remembering and celebrating God's deliverance and protection, similar to other feasts like Passover. The confirmation of these days underscores the importance of communal memory and the continuity of cultural and religious identity.<p><b>just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them</b><br>Mordecai and Esther, key figures in the Book of Esther, played crucial roles in the salvation of the Jewish people. Mordecai, a relative and guardian of Esther, is portrayed as a wise and faithful leader. Esther, as queen, used her position to influence the king and save her people. Their establishment of Purim highlights their leadership and the divine providence that worked through them. This also illustrates the theme of God using individuals in positions of influence to fulfill His purposes, a recurring motif in biblical narratives.<p><b>and had committed themselves and their descendants</b><br>The commitment to observe Purim was not only for the current generation but also for future generations. This reflects the biblical principle of passing down faith and traditions to descendants, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. The continuity of Purim observance emphasizes the importance of historical consciousness and the transmission of faith and identity through generations.<p><b>to the times of fasting and lamentation</b><br>Fasting and lamentation were integral to the Jewish response to the threat they faced, as seen earlier in the Book of Esther when the Jews fasted in response to Haman's decree. These practices are expressions of humility, repentance, and dependence on God. Fasting is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with seeking God's intervention, as seen in the stories of Daniel and Nehemiah. The inclusion of fasting and lamentation in the observance of Purim serves as a reminder of the gravity of the situation from which they were delivered and the importance of seeking God in times of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai_the_jew.htm">Mordecai the Jew</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Esther, Mordecai is Esther's cousin and guardian.

Just as God had Israel memorialize the Passover &#8220;as a perpetual statute&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), so Mordecai and Esther secure Purim as an enduring testimony of divine rescue.<p>&#8226; The act of confirmation also echoes <a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>, where memorial stones were set up &#8220;so that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD.&#8221; By locking Purim into place, the Jews ensure that every future generation will revisit God&#8217;s saving power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At their appointed time</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues: &#8220;at their appointed time,&#8221; emphasizing order and precision. God&#8217;s redemptive works are never haphazard; they unfold on His calendar (<a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Appointed times anchor the memory. Celebrating Purim on the same dates every year&#8212;13-15 Adar&#8212;prevents distortion of the story and keeps the community synchronized in gratitude, much as believers today mark Resurrection Sunday to remember the empty tomb (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them</b><p>&#8226; By naming both leaders, Scripture highlights a united front. Mordecai drafts the edict (<a href="/esther/9-20.htm">Esther 9:20</a>), and Esther&#8217;s royal authority seals it (<a href="/esther/9-29.htm">Esther 9:29</a>). Their partnership models godly leadership: humble courage under God&#8217;s providence.<p>&#8226; Their establishment carries legal weight similar to Daniel&#8217;s decree-proof that God can use His people, even in exile, to set laws that honor Him (<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had committed themselves</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Committed&#8221; speaks of a voluntary, wholehearted pledge. <a href="/psalms/119-106.htm">Psalm 119:106</a> reflects a similar vow: &#8220;I have sworn and confirmed that I will keep Your righteous judgments.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The commitment is personal first&#8212;Mordecai and Esther lead by example before they instruct others. Leadership rooted in obedience invites others to follow (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And their descendants</b><p>&#8226; Purim is not merely for contemporaries; it is for &#8220;their descendants.&#8221; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> commands parents to impress God&#8217;s works upon their children.<p>&#8226; Passing the feast down the family line guarantees that identity is preserved. <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a> reminds us, &#8220;For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction,&#8221; making Purim a living classroom of God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the times of fasting and lamentation</b><p>&#8226; The verse ends by tying Purim to &#8220;times of fasting and lamentation,&#8221; recalling <a href="/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3 and 4</a>:16 when sackcloth, ashes, and prayer preceded deliverance. Deliverance and mourning are forever linked: remembering the sorrow makes the celebration sweeter.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> shows how fasts connected to past tragedies can become &#8220;joyful and glad occasions.&#8221; Purim embodies that transformation: tears turned to laughter, doom reversed to triumph (<a href="/esther/9-22.htm">Esther 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/9-31.htm">Esther 9:31</a> records the formal ratification of Purim so that God&#8217;s dramatic rescue of His people will be remembered on specific days, under the authority of faithful leaders, embraced personally and generationally, and always rooted in the sobering memory of the fasting that birthed it. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s acts deserve lasting memorials, orderly observance, and wholehearted commitment&#8212;ensuring that future generations see, celebrate, and trust the faithful hand of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">To confirm . . . enjoined . . . decreed.</span>--The same Hebrew verb stands for the three different English verbs; it is also the <span class= "ital">stablish</span> of <a href="/esther/9-21.htm" title="To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,">Esther 9:21</a>.

All Hebrew MSS., however, and all the other ancient versions, retain the words, and we must, therefore, suppose that the Jews throughout the empire had instituted fasts and lamentations, in addition to what Mordecai's letter had enjoined, Thus we may probably connect this with the fast now observed on Adar 13.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they had decreed for themselves and their seed</span>. "As they - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews generally - had decreed" (see ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">The matters of the fastings and their cry</span>. These words stand in no clear grammatical relation to the preceding, and are otherwise very difficult to explain. They are thought to allude to the establishment by the provincial Jews, apart from Mordecai and Esther, of the 13th of Adar as a day of fasting and wailing; but if so, it is strange that nothing has been previously said of this ordinance. The plural form of the word for "fastings" is also suspicious, since it does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. Altogether, it is perhaps most probable that the words were originally the gloss of a commentator, written in the margin, and that they have been accidentally transferred to the text. They do not occur in the Septuagint. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">in order to confirm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1441;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;qay&#183;y&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
