The king's decrees were binding, and any disobedience was seen as a challenge to his rule. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of law and order, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, where believers are instructed to submit to governing authorities.<p><b>he asked,</b><br>King Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus, sought counsel from his advisors, demonstrating the practice of consulting wise men or counselors, a common practice in ancient monarchies. This mirrors the biblical principle of seeking wisdom from others, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states that there is safety in a multitude of counselors.<p><b>what should be done with Queen Vashti,</b><br>Queen Vashti's refusal to appear before the king was unprecedented and posed a significant challenge to royal authority. Her actions could set a precedent for other women in the empire, potentially leading to widespread disobedience. This situation highlights the cultural expectations of women in ancient Persia, where they were expected to be obedient and subservient to their husbands.<p><b>since she refused to obey the command of King Xerxes</b><br>Vashti's refusal is a pivotal moment in the narrative, setting the stage for Esther's rise. It underscores the theme of divine providence, as God uses human actions, even those of disobedience, to fulfill His purposes. This can be compared to Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where God uses what was meant for evil for good.<p><b>delivered by the eunuchs?</b><br>Eunuchs were trusted servants in the royal court, often tasked with carrying out sensitive duties. Their involvement in delivering the king's command underscores the hierarchical structure of the Persian court. This reflects the broader biblical theme of servanthood and the role of intermediaries, as seen in the role of angels as messengers of God in <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Xerxes frames the issue inside the boundaries of established Persian statute, showing that even an absolute monarch wants his judgment to appear just, not arbitrary (<a href="/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights the stability&#8212;and sometimes rigidity&#8212;of royal decrees (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; By appealing to law first, the narrative underscores the biblical theme that lawful order preserves society (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;2</a>), even when the ruler himself is pagan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he asked</b><p>&#8226; The king turns to his advisers for counsel, modeling the principle that wise leaders seek input (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet his inquiry also reveals the limits of human wisdom; throughout Esther God&#8217;s unseen sovereignty overrules earthly deliberations (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what should be done</b><p>&#8226; A direct question about consequences: in Scripture, actions yield results (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Xerxes wants a clear, decisive course&#8212;mirroring the urgency found when Darius sought a solution for Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The story prepares us for the irrevocable edict that will elevate Esther later (<a href="/esther/2-1.htm">Esther 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Queen Vashti</b><p>&#8226; Naming Vashti personalizes the offense; she is not merely a subject but the queen who publicly opposed her husband (<a href="/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Her unique status heightens the stakes, similar to how Michal challenged David&#8217;s dignity (<a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since she refused to obey</b><p>&#8226; Refusal equals open rebellion; Scripture equates rebellion with serious sin (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative contrasts human pride with submissive obedience, foreshadowing Esther&#8217;s own humble courage (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejection of rightful authority disrupts order, a principle echoed in <a href="/bsb/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a> when Miriam and Aaron resisted Moses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the command of King Xerxes</b><p>&#8226; Royal commands in Persia carried ultimate weight; violation threatened the entire chain of command (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; In biblical history, kingship implies delegated authority under God; even pagan rulers serve His purposes (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; This incident exposes Xerxes&#8217; vulnerability&#8212;his power is only as strong as public respect for his word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>delivered by the eunuchs</b><p>&#8226; The eunuchs were trusted palace officials; Vashti&#8217;s refusal humiliates them too, making the breach more public (<a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Messengers often symbolize accountability: when Saul spared Agag, Samuel confronted him; here the eunuchs carry back Vashti&#8217;s defiance.<p>&#8226; By highlighting the intermediaries, the text stresses that disobedience echoes through every level of authority (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/1-15.htm">Esther 1:15</a> records a pivotal moment where Xerxes, appealing to the irrevocable &#8220;law of the Persians and Medes,&#8221; seeks counsel on how to deal with Queen Vashti&#8217;s blatant refusal of his royal command. Each phrase spotlights a key principle: the necessity of lawful order, the value and limits of human counsel, the inevitability of consequences, the gravity of rebellion&#8212;especially by those in high position&#8212;and the far-reaching impact of disobedience on the entire governance structure. In the unfolding drama, God remains silently sovereign, using even a pagan king&#8217;s legalistic concern for order to set the stage for Esther&#8217;s rise and Israel&#8217;s deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we do to queen Vashti according to law</span>?
