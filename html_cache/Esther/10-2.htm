His accomplishments include his role in thwarting a plot against King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) and his influence in saving the Jewish people from Haman's decree. Mordecai's actions demonstrate the providence of God working through individuals to achieve His purposes. His story parallels Joseph's rise to power in Egypt, where both figures are elevated to positions of influence in foreign courts.<p><b>together with the full account of the greatness to which the king had raised him</b><br>Mordecai's elevation by King Xerxes signifies a dramatic reversal of fortune, a common motif in biblical narratives. This phrase highlights the king's recognition of Mordecai's loyalty and wisdom, which led to his promotion. The king's favor towards Mordecai can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bless those who bless His people (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Mordecai's rise also prefigures the exaltation of Christ, who was raised to the highest place of honor after His suffering (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the historical authenticity and significance of Mordecai's achievements. The "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia" refers to official records kept by the Persian Empire, similar to the annals mentioned in <a href="/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23 and 6</a>:1. While these specific records have not survived, their mention underscores the historical context of the narrative.
