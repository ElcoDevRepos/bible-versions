White and blue were colors often associated with royalty and nobility in ancient Persia. The choice of these colors may symbolize purity and divinity, as blue is often linked to the heavens in biblical symbolism. Linen, a high-quality fabric, was commonly used in the garments of priests and the tabernacle, indicating a connection to holiness and worship.<p><b>were fastened with cords of fine white and purple material</b><br>Purple was a color of great significance, often associated with wealth, power, and royalty due to the expense of the dye. The use of purple cords alongside white suggests a display of the king's wealth and authority. In biblical times, purple dye was extracted from the murex shellfish, making it rare and costly. This detail highlights the luxurious setting of the Persian court.<p><b>to silver rings on the marble pillars</b><br>Silver, a precious metal, was commonly used in the construction of palaces and temples, signifying wealth and splendor. The marble pillars indicate the architectural sophistication of the Persian Empire. Marble was a prized material, often used in significant buildings, and its presence in the king's palace underscores the empire's prosperity and the king's desire to impress his guests.<p><b>Gold and silver couches</b><br>The mention of gold and silver couches further emphasizes the luxury and opulence of the setting. Gold and silver were symbols of wealth and status, and their use in furniture indicates the king's immense resources. This detail reflects the grandeur of the Persian Empire and the king's intention to display his power and riches to his subjects and guests.<p><b>were arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones</b><br>The mosaic pavement composed of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones illustrates the artistic and architectural achievements of the time. Porphyry, a purple stone, was highly valued in the ancient world, often used in imperial contexts. The use of mother-of-pearl and other precious stones in the flooring highlights the extravagance of the Persian court. This setting serves as a backdrop for the events in the Book of Esther, emphasizing the contrast between the king's earthly wealth and the divine providence that ultimately guides the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

White often pictures purity and light (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>), while blue is repeatedly linked with royalty and heavenly authority, appearing in the priestly garments and Tabernacle curtains (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 31</a>). By recording these colors together, the text highlights the king&#8217;s earthly majesty and hints at the coming tension between human power and divine sovereignty that drives the book. The lavish scene contrasts sharply with the humble status of the Jewish exiles, foreshadowing the dramatic reversal God will bring (<a href="/esther/9-1.htm">Esther 9:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fastened with cords of fine white and purple material to silver rings on the marble pillars</b><p>The hangings are secured by cords woven with purple&#8212;another royal color (<a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="/mark/15-17.htm">Mark 15:17</a>). Purple dye was costly and reserved for the highest ranks, emphasizing that nothing about this feast is mediocre. The silver rings and marble pillars add permanence and grandeur, recalling Solomon&#8217;s temple furnishings of precious metals and stone (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48&#8211;50</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>). Scripture presents these details literally to underline the magnitude of the earthly kingdom God&#8217;s people must face, yet also to remind readers that &#8220;the LORD has established His throne in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>) over every earthly throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gold and silver couches</b><p>Even the seating shouts extravagance&#8212;gold and silver, materials considered common only in the golden age of Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>). <a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1&#8211;4</a> depicts a similar Babylonian feast, where opulence leads to arrogance and judgment. Here, too, the couches silently warn of pride. <a href="/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1&#8211;5</a> cautions the wealthy who trust in riches rather than God. The literal couches set the stage for the unseen hand of providence that will soon overturn Persian decrees in favor of God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones</b><p>The floor itself is a work of art&#8212;porphyry (a deep purple stone prized by emperors), bright marble, shimmering mother-of-pearl, and &#8220;other costly stones.&#8221; Similar gemstone lists adorn the priestly breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17&#8211;20</a>) and the foundations of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19&#8211;21</a>). By paralleling divine imagery with pagan luxury, the text invites comparison: earthly splendor fades, but God&#8217;s glory endures. The literal stones beneath the guests&#8217; feet underscore how far human rulers will go to declare their greatness, even as the true King uses the humblest means&#8212;a Jewish orphan named Esther&#8212;to safeguard His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a> paints a literal, opulent scene meant to impress the senses: royal fabrics, precious metals, and jewel-like flooring.

Mr. Loftus supposes that it was carried across from the central pillared hall to the detached porticoes, thus shading the guests from the intense heat of the sun ('Chaldaea and Susiana,' p. 375). <span class="cmt_word">Fastened with cords of fine linen and purple</span>. Very strong cords would be needed to support the awning if it was carried across as above suggested, over a space of nearly sixty feet. <span class="cmt_word">To rings of silver</span>. The exact use of the rings is doubtful. Perhaps they were inserted into the stone work in order that the cords might be made fast to them. <span class="cmt_word">Pillars of marble</span>. The pillars at Susa are not of marble, but of a dark-blue limestone. Perhaps the Hebrew <span class="accented">shesh</span> designated this stone rather than marble. <span class="cmt_word">The beds were of gold and silver</span>. The couches on which the guests reclined are intended (comp. <a href="/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>). These were either covered with gold and silver cloth, or had their actual framework of the precious metals, like those which Xerxes took with him into Greece (see Herod., 9:82). <span class="cmt_word">Upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.</span> The four words which follow "pavement" are not adjectives denoting colours, but the names of four different materials. One is <span class="accented">shesh</span>, the material of the pillars, which accords with the fact that such pavement slabs as have been found at Susa are, like the columns, of a blue limestone. The other materials are unknown to us, and we cannot say what the exact colours were; but no doubt the general result was a mosaic pavement of four different hues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Hangings of] white</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;
