Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, was a significant center of power, and the decree's issuance from there underscores its authority and reach. Historically, the Persian Empire was known for its extensive bureaucracy and record-keeping, which is reflected in the existence of a written decree. The decree for the destruction of the Jews is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's people faced annihilation, such as Pharaoh's decree in Exodus. This situation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance that God provides, pointing to the salvation found in Jesus Christ.<p><b>to show and explain to Esther</b><br>Mordecai's intent to show and explain the decree to Esther indicates the importance of communication and understanding in dire circumstances. Esther, living in the palace, may have been insulated from the immediate effects of the decree, highlighting the separation between the royal court and the common people. This act of explanation is crucial, as it empowers Esther with the knowledge needed to act. It reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom and understanding, as seen in Proverbs.<p><b>urging her to approach the king</b><br>Mordecai's urging signifies the urgency and desperation of the situation. Approaching the king was a dangerous act, as Persian law prohibited anyone from entering the king's presence uninvited, under penalty of death. This reflects the absolute power of the Persian monarchy and the risks involved in seeking justice. The act of approaching the king can be seen as a type of intercession, similar to how Christ intercedes on behalf of humanity before God.<p><b>implore his favor</b><br>Imploring the king's favor suggests a reliance on mercy and grace, themes prevalent throughout Scripture. In the ancient Near East, favor from a king could mean life or death, and Esther's plea for favor mirrors the believer's plea for God's grace. This act of seeking favor is a precursor to the grace offered through Jesus Christ, who provides access to the Father.<p><b>and plead before him for her people</b><br>Esther's role as an advocate for her people is a powerful image of intercession. Her willingness to plead before the king on behalf of the Jews is a type of Christ, who pleads on behalf of humanity. This act of advocacy is a central theme in the Bible, where leaders often stand in the gap for their people, as seen with Moses and the Israelites. Esther's intercession is a reminder of the power of prayer and advocacy in the face of injustice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the cousin and guardian of Esther.
