The king's dismissal of the monetary offer indicates his trust in Haman and possibly his indifference to the fate of the Jewish people. This reflects the absolute power and wealth of the Persian Empire, where the king's word was law, and financial incentives were not always necessary to enact decrees. The king's response also highlights the dangerous influence Haman held, as he was able to persuade the king without financial persuasion. This moment foreshadows the potential for misuse of power and the vulnerability of minority groups within the empire.<p><b>&#8220;These people are given to you&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "these people" refers to the Jewish population within the Persian Empire. Historically, the Jews were a dispersed people, having been exiled from their homeland. This dispersion is known as the Diaspora. The king's statement of giving the people to Haman underscores the precarious position of the Jews, who were subject to the whims of foreign rulers. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people living in exile and facing persecution, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the Babylonian captivity. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith and reliance on God's providence.<p><b>&#8220;to do with them as you please.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase grants Haman full authority over the Jewish people, effectively giving him the power of life and death. It illustrates the absolute nature of royal decrees in the Persian Empire, where the king's word was final and irrevocable. This mirrors the absolute authority of God, contrasting human authority with divine sovereignty. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, though having all authority, chooses to use it for salvation rather than destruction. The phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's deliverance through Esther, highlighting the theme of divine intervention and protection of His people, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Rather, "the silver of the people is given thee, together with the people themselves, to do with both as it pleases thee." Confiscation always accompanies execution in the East, and the goods of those who are put to death naturally escheat to the crown, which either seizes them or makes a grant of them. Compare ch. 8:11, where the property of those of the Jews' enemies who should suffer death is granted to those who should slay them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Keep your money,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;ke&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
