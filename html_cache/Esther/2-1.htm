Historically, this period may have included Xerxes' campaign against Greece, which ended in defeat. The time lapse suggests a cooling-off period for Xerxes, allowing for reflection and the setting of the stage for Esther's introduction.<p><b>when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided</b><br>Xerxes' anger was initially provoked by Vashti's refusal to appear before him and his guests. The subsiding of his anger suggests a return to rationality and a potential openness to new counsel. This change in demeanor is crucial for the unfolding of God's providential plan through Esther.<p><b>he remembered Vashti</b><br>Xerxes' remembrance of Vashti indicates a moment of reflection on past decisions. This could imply regret or nostalgia, highlighting the human tendency to reconsider past actions. It sets the stage for the search for a new queen, which is central to the narrative.<p><b>and what she had done</b><br>Vashti's actions were seen as defiance against the king's authority, leading to her removal. This phrase underscores the cultural expectations of women in the Persian Empire and the severe consequences of challenging royal authority. It also reflects the broader theme of power and submission in the book.<p><b>and what had been decreed against her</b><br>The decree against Vashti was irrevocable, as was typical of Persian law (cf. <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>). This highlights the permanence of royal edicts and the legal framework within which the story unfolds. It also foreshadows the later decree concerning the Jews, which Esther and Mordecai must navigate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over a vast empire.
