In the ancient Persian Empire, the king's signet ring was a symbol of the king's delegated authority. Haman, who previously held this ring, had been executed for his plot against the Jews, demonstrating the reversal of fortune and divine justice. The removal of the ring from Haman signifies the end of his influence and the nullification of his decrees. This act reflects the biblical theme of the downfall of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a>, "The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead."<p><b>and presented it to Mordecai</b><br>Mordecai's elevation to a position of power is a significant turn of events, highlighting the providence of God in the lives of His people. Mordecai, a Jew, now holds the same authority that Haman once used to attempt to destroy the Jewish people. This transfer of power is reminiscent of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-42</a>), where he was given Pharaoh's signet ring, symbolizing trust and authority. Mordecai's new role foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people and serves as a type of Christ, who was exalted after His suffering (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<p><b>And Esther appointed Mordecai over the estate of Haman</b><br>Esther's appointment of Mordecai over Haman's estate demonstrates her continued influence and wisdom. In ancient times, the confiscation of a traitor's property was common, and it was often given to those loyal to the crown. This act not only rewards Mordecai for his loyalty and service but also ensures that Haman's wealth and resources are used for the benefit of the Jewish people. This redistribution of wealth echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, "The wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous." Esther's decision also reflects her role as a mediator and protector of her people, paralleling Christ's intercessory work for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Mordecai's position had now become what Daniel's had been to Darius, that nobler servant to a worthier lord (see <a href="/daniel/6-2.htm" title="And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.">Daniel 6:2</a>, 38). He was the queen's cousin, and he had on one occasion been the means of saving the king's life, and therefore starts under distinctly favourable auspices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king took off his ring</span>. The king's signet would, as a matter of course, be taken from Haman before his execution and restored to Ahasuerus, who now once more wore it himself. Business, however, was irksome to him, and, having resolved to make Mordecai minister in Haman's room, he very soon took the signet off again, and made it over to the new vizier. <span class="cmt_word">And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman</span>. It would not have been seemly for Esther to give away what she had received as a gift from the king. She was therefore unable to make Mordecai a present of the house. But she did what was equivalent - she set him over it, made him practically its master. Thus he was provided with a residence suitable to his new dignity. AT ESTHER'S REQUEST AHASUERUS ALLOWS THE ISSUE OF A SECOND EDICT, PERMITTING THE JEWS TO RESIST ANY WHO SHOULD ATTACK THEM, TO KILL THEM IN THEIR OWN DEFENCE, AND TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR GOODS (<a href="/esther/8-3.htm">Esther 8:3-14</a>). The execution of Haman, the confiscation of his property, the advancement of Mordecai into his place, though of favourable omen, as showing the present temper and inclination of Abasuerus, left the Jews in as great danger as before. In most countries there would neither have been delay nor difficulty. The edict which went forth on the 13th of Nisan (<a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>), and which could not be executed till the 13th of Adar, would have been cancelled, revoked, recalled. But in Persia this could not be done; or at any rate it could not be done without breaking one of the first principles of Persian law, the principle that "the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse" (ver. 8). It was therefore necessary to devise a mode whereby the desired escape of the Jews might practically be obtained, and yet the edict remain unrevoked, and the king's honour be saved. At first Mordecai and Esther do not appear to have seen this, and Esther asked openly for the <span class="accented">reversal</span> of the decree, only representing it as the writing of Haman, and not the writing of the king (ver. 5). But Ahasuerus pointed out that this could not be done. Anything short of a reversal, any new decree, he would sanction; but he could do no more - he could not revoke his own word (ver. 8). The course actually followed was then devised, probably by Mordecai. The old decree was allowed to stand; but a new decree was issued and signed in the usual way, whereby the Jews were allowed and encouraged to resist those who should attack them, - to "gather themselves together, and to stand for their life; to destroy, slay, and cause to perish all the power of the people of the province that would assault them," - and were further permitted to "take the spoil of them for a prey," or, in other words, to seize the property of all whom they should slay (ver. 11). The royal posts carried out this decree (ver. 14), as they had the former one; and it was publicly set forth and proclaimed in every province, that if the Jews were attacked under the terms of the one, they might defend themselves and retaliate on their foes under the terms of the other (ver. 13). As the second decree was issued on the 23rd of Sivan, the third month (ver. 9), and the day appointed for the attack was the 13th of Adar, the twelfth, there was ample time-above eight months - for the Jews to make preparations, to organise themselves, to collect arms, and to arrange an effective resistance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
