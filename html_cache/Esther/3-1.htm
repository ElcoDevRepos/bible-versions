The timing suggests a period of transition or change in the Persian court, setting the stage for Haman's rise to power. It highlights the unfolding narrative of divine providence and the unseen hand of God working through historical events.<p><b>King Xerxes honored Haman</b><br>King Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus, was the ruler of the Persian Empire. His decision to honor Haman indicates a significant shift in court dynamics. Haman's rise to power is pivotal in the story of Esther, as it sets up the conflict between him and Mordecai. This honor contrasts with Mordecai's earlier service to the king, which went unrewarded at this point, emphasizing themes of justice and timing in God's plan.<p><b>son of Hammedatha, the Agagite</b><br>Haman's lineage is significant. Being an Agagite connects him to Agag, the king of the Amalekites, who were long-standing enemies of Israel. This historical enmity is rooted in the conflict between Israel and Amalek, as seen in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>. The mention of Haman's ancestry foreshadows the tension and animosity he will have towards the Jewish people, particularly Mordecai.<p><b>elevating him to a position above all the princes who were with him</b><br>Haman's elevation to a high-ranking position signifies his influence and authority in the Persian Empire. This promotion above other princes indicates his favored status with the king, which he later uses to further his own agenda against the Jews. This mirrors the biblical theme of the rise and fall of leaders, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Daniel, where God uses the positions of power for His purposes. Haman's rise also sets the stage for the dramatic reversal of fortunes that is central to the narrative of Esther.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Mordecai had saved the king&#8217;s life, yet no reward came his way. Instead, time passed in silence.<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes a pause between faithfulness and recognition (<a href="/genesis/40-23.htm">Genesis 40:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>). God&#8217;s timing, not ours, controls the stage (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Such delays remind us that the unseen hand of Providence keeps perfect books even when earthly ledgers seem off balance (<a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Honored&#8221; shows a public, official promotion. Yet the throne chooses the wrong man, elevating an enemy of God&#8217;s people. The injustice feels jarring, and that tension drives the story forward (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Agagite&#8221; links Haman to Agag, king of the Amalekites, a nation sworn to Israel&#8217;s harm (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). Saul spared Agag and lost his crown (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>). Generations later the old feud re-ignites in Persia.<p>&#8226; The clash is more than politics; it is spiritual lineage&#8212;Amalek versus Israel, flesh versus faith.

Haman&#8217;s promotion will ultimately expose his pride and precipitate his downfall (<a href="/esther/7-9.htm">Esther 7:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the scene is a sober reminder that power structures can tilt toward unrighteousness, but the King of kings still rules the rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a> records a puzzling promotion: after Mordecai&#8217;s loyal service, Haman&#8212;an ancestral foe of Israel&#8212;receives honor above all. The verse exposes apparent injustices, reveals an age-old spiritual conflict, and shows God quietly orchestrating events. Though Haman rises, the Lord is already positioning His people for rescue, proving that even when evil seems exalted, Providence remains at work for ultimate good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>III.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Haman . . . the Agagite.</span>--Nothing appears to be known of Haman save from this book. His name, as well as that of his father and his sons, is Persian; and it is thus difficult to see the meaning of the name <span class= "ital">Agagite.</span> which has generally been assumed to imply descent from Agag, king of the Amalekites, with whom the name Agag <span class= "ital">may</span> have been dynastic (<a href="/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm" title="And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.">1Samuel 15:8</a>). Thus Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xi.</span> 6. 5) and the Chaldee Targum call him an Amalekite. But apart from the difficulty of the name being Persian, it is hard to see how, after the wholesale destruction of Amalek recorded in 1 Samuel 15, any members should have been left of the kingly family, maintaining a distinct tribal name for so many centuries. In one of the Greek Apocryphal additions to Esther (after <a href="/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a>) Haman is called a Macedonian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span>.
