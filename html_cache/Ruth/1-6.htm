Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and its people were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). Naomi's presence in Moab signifies a departure from the Promised Land due to famine (<a href="/ruth/1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of exile and return, reminiscent of Israel's future exiles.<p><b>that the LORD had attended to His people</b><br>The phrase indicates divine intervention and care. The LORD, Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His faithfulness to Israel. This echoes the recurring biblical theme of God responding to the cries of His people, as seen in the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). It underscores God's sovereignty and His role as provider and protector.<p><b>by providing them with food</b><br>The provision of food signifies the end of the famine in Bethlehem, "the house of bread." This provision is a tangible sign of God's blessing and favor, often associated with obedience and repentance (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). It also foreshadows the spiritual nourishment found in Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab</b><br>Naomi's decision to return to Bethlehem with her daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, marks a pivotal moment of faith and hope. It reflects a return to God's promises and a rejection of Moabite idolatry. This journey symbolizes repentance and restoration, themes central to the biblical narrative. Ruth's eventual inclusion in the lineage of David and Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) highlights God's redemptive plan for all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow living in Moab, originally from Bethlehem in Judah.

Perhaps, too, the scenes where everything reminded her of her husband and sons, filled her with sadness (for it would appear that she set out immediately after her sons' death), and perhaps, too, her conscience smote her for distrusting the mercies of the God of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> - the conjunction in Hebrew is the common generic copulative <span class="accented">and</span> - she arose. She had been <span class="accented">sitting</span>, as it were, where her husband had settled, and she now rose up to depart (see ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">She, and her daughters-in, law.</span> The word for "her daughters-in-law -" <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span> - is literally "her brides," that is, the brides of her sons. That she might return - an admirable rendering into English idiom. The phrase in the original is simply "and she returned," that is, "and she began to return." <span class="cmt_word">From the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.</span> Or, more literally, "<span class="accented">for</span> she heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah" - or, rather, "Yahveh," or, as Epiphanius gives it, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;</span> - "<span class="accented">had</span> visited his people to give them bread." There is no warrant, however, and no need, to add, with the Chaldee Targumist, that the news was conveyed <span class="accented">by the mouth of an angel</span>. And the representation is not that Yahveh, in giving, bread to his people, had thereby visited them; it is that he hid visited them" to give them bread. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, rendered <span class="accented">visited</span>, is quite peculiar, with no analogue in English, German, Greek, or Latin. Yahveh had <span class="accented">directed his attention</span> to his people, and had, so to speak, <span class="accented">made inquisition into their state</span>, and had hence taken steps to give them bread (see <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). They had already got it, or, as the Septuagint translates, they had got <span class="accented">loaves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">meats</span> (eseas). It is assumed in the tidings that the seasons and their products, and all beneficent influences in nature, belong to Yahveh. It is likewise assumed that the Hebrews were his people, albeit not in such a sense as to secure for them more "bread" and "milk and honey" than other peoples enjoyed. Their chief prerogatives were spiritual and moral. <span class="accented">They were his Messianic people</span>.
