Ruth, a Moabitess, signifies the inclusion of Gentiles into God's plan, foreshadowing the New Testament's message of salvation for all nations. The acquisition of Ruth as a wife by Boaz fulfills the role of kinsman-redeemer, a type of Christ who redeems and restores. The mention of Ruth's Moabite origin underscores the breaking of ethnic barriers, as Moabites were traditionally seen as outsiders (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>).<p><b>to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance</b><br>This reflects the importance of family lineage and inheritance in ancient Israelite society. The preservation of a deceased man's name through offspring was crucial for maintaining property within the family and ensuring the deceased's legacy. This practice is rooted in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>) and emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant promises through generations. It also points to the eternal inheritance believers receive through Christ, who secures our place in God's family.<p><b>so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home</b><br>The gate of a city was a place of legal transactions and community gatherings, symbolizing public recognition and honor. Ensuring that Mahlon's name does not disappear signifies the restoration of his family's honor and standing within the community. This act of redemption by Boaz mirrors Christ's work in restoring humanity's relationship with God, ensuring that believers' names are written in the Book of Life (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>).<p><b>You are witnesses today.</b><br>The presence of witnesses was essential for validating legal transactions and ensuring community accountability. This public declaration by Boaz not only legitimizes the marriage and redemption but also involves the community in the covenantal act. It reflects the communal nature of faith and the importance of testimony in the life of believers, paralleling the role of witnesses in the early church (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy landowner in Bethlehem, Boaz is a kinsman-redeemer for Naomi's family.

The community&#8217;s &#8220;Amen&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11-12</a>) turns a legal act into a communal blessing, highlighting how obedience blesses everyone around it (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Boaz&#8217;s words in <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a> reveal a kinsman-redeemer who purchases land, marries Ruth, and safeguards Mahlon&#8217;s lineage so that the family&#8217;s name, property, and legacy remain intact. Every phrase underscores covenant faithfulness: Boaz honors God&#8217;s law, protects the vulnerable, and invites community witness. In doing so, he foreshadows Christ, our greater Redeemer, who secures an everlasting inheritance and ensures our names are never lost in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And likewise Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Machlon, have I acquired to myself to wife, to establish the name of the deceased upon his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased may not be cut off from among his Brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</span> This, to Boaz, would be by far the most delightful part of the day's proceedings. His heart would swell with manly pride and devout gratitude when he realized, amid all the cumbrous technicalities of old Hebrew law, that Ruth was his. And he would rejoice all the more, <span class="accented">as</span>, in virtue of her connection with Machlon and Elimelech, both of their names would still be encircled with honor, and might, by the blessing of Yahveh, be linked on distinguishingly and lovingly to future generations. Note the expression, "<span class="accented">that</span> the name of the deceased may not be cut off from among his brethren, <span class="accented">and from the gate of his place</span>." The people who assembled at the gate might on some future day be able to say, "<span class="accented">This</span> boy is the heir of Machlon and Elimelech, who once migrated to Moab." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moreover,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
