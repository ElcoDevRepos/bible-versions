This was a common practice in ancient Israel, reflecting the agrarian lifestyle and the need for security. The act of lying down signifies rest after a day of labor, and it sets the stage for Ruth's approach. The threshing floor is a significant location, often associated with judgment and separation in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>.<p><b>Note the place where he lies</b><br>Ruth is instructed to observe carefully where Boaz lies down, ensuring she approaches the right person. This highlights the importance of discernment and precision in following God's plan. The act of noting the place also underscores the personal nature of Ruth's mission, as she is to approach Boaz discreetly and respectfully.<p><b>Then go in and uncover his feet</b><br>Uncovering Boaz's feet is a symbolic act of humility and submission. In the cultural context, this gesture can be seen as a request for protection and provision, akin to a marriage proposal. The act of uncovering feet is also reminiscent of other biblical instances where feet are significant, such as Jesus washing the disciples' feet in <a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5</a>, symbolizing servanthood and humility.<p><b>And lie down</b><br>Ruth lying down at Boaz's feet is an act of trust and vulnerability. It signifies her willingness to submit to Boaz's authority and protection. This action is not suggestive of impropriety but rather a culturally understood gesture of seeking refuge and redemption. It parallels the believer's submission to Christ, seeking His covering and grace.<p><b>And he will explain to you what you should do</b><br>This phrase indicates Boaz's role as a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). Boaz's response will determine the course of Ruth's future, reflecting God's providential guidance. The expectation that Boaz will explain what to do underscores the theme of divine direction and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trust in the Lord leads to guidance and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem to seek refuge and a new life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>Ruth's mother-in-law, who has returned to Bethlehem after the death of her husband and sons, and is seeking security for Ruth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential relative of Naomi's late husband, who is a potential kinsman-redeemer for Ruth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The location where Boaz is winnowing barley, and where Ruth is instructed to go to seek his protection and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_trust.htm">Obedience and Trust</a></b><br>Ruth's willingness to follow Naomi's instructions demonstrates obedience and trust.

Similar nighttime encounters appear when God directs key covenant moments in quiet, vulnerable hours&#8212;think of Jacob at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-15</a>) or Samuel hearing God&#8217;s voice before dawn (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3-10</a>).

Naomi ventured, on a bold expedient to bring speedy rest to her daughter-in-law. But we assume that, with unmistaking feminine intuition, she saw, on the one hand, that Boaz was already deeply attached to Ruth, and, on the other, that Ruth reciprocated his attachment with pure intensity. Most probably we should also assume that she detected in Boaz a peculiar diffidence that caused him to shrink from making decisive advances in the way of declaring his affection. He had, however, unconsciously revealed himself, and made it clear to Naomi that he wished to divulge in words the depth of his honorable feelings. But again and again, as we may suppose, his sensitiveness overcame his resolutions. Hence Naomi's scheme to bring him to the point of declaration. It would have been reprehensible in the extreme had she not been absolutely certain of his wishes, on the one hand, and of his perfect honor and un-contaminable purity on the other. And even with that qualification, the scheme would have been imprudent and improper, and utterly unfeminine, had it not been the case that, in virtue of an ancient and much-prized Hebrew law, Ruth was entitled to call upon her nearest of kin to fulfill the various duties of a responsible kinsman. Still, notwithstanding the existence of this law, we may rest assured that the sensitive gleaner would never have summoned up courage to ask Boaz to discharge to her the duties of kinship, unless she had been sure that the thrills that vibrated within her own heart were responsive to subtle touches, on his part, of spirit with spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When he lies down,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
