In the context of ancient Israel, gleaning was a provision for the poor, widows, and foreigners (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). Ruth, a Moabite and widow, fits this description, highlighting her vulnerability and dependence on God's provision. The town referred to is Bethlehem, a significant location in biblical history as the future birthplace of Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Ruth's journey into the town symbolizes her integration into the community of Israel, foreshadowing her role in the lineage of David and ultimately, Christ.<p><b>where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned</b><br>Naomi's observation of Ruth's gleaning underscores the theme of provision and God's faithfulness. Naomi, who returned to Bethlehem in a state of bitterness and loss (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20-21</a>), begins to witness the tangible evidence of God's care through Ruth's efforts. This moment marks a turning point in Naomi's life, as she starts to see hope and restoration. The act of gleaning not only provides physical sustenance but also serves as a metaphor for God's grace and redemption.<p><b>And she brought out what she had saved from her meal and gave it to Naomi</b><br>Ruth's generosity in sharing her meal with Naomi reflects her selflessness and loyalty. This act of kindness is a testament to her character and the deep bond between her and Naomi. In the cultural context, sharing food was a sign of hospitality and care, reinforcing the familial relationship between them. This gesture also prefigures the sacrificial love of Christ, who provides for our needs and invites us to partake in His abundance. Ruth's actions exemplify the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and caring for family, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by staying with her and working to provide for them both.
