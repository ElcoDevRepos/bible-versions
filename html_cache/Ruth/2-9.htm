In the context of ancient Israel, gleaning was a provision for the poor, widows, and foreigners, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-22</a>. Ruth, a Moabite and widow, exemplifies humility and industriousness by participating in this practice. The field represents God's provision and the opportunity for sustenance, echoing the biblical theme of God providing for His people.<p><b>and follow along after these girls</b><br>Ruth is instructed to follow the female workers, which highlights the social structure and gender roles of the time. Women often worked in groups for safety and efficiency. This instruction also signifies Ruth's acceptance into the community, despite her foreign status. It reflects the biblical principle of community support and protection for the vulnerable, as seen in the laws of gleaning.<p><b>Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you</b><br>This phrase underscores the protective measures taken by Boaz, the landowner, to ensure Ruth's safety. In the ancient Near East, women, especially foreigners, were vulnerable to harassment. Boaz's command reflects his integrity and respect for Ruth, aligning with the biblical call for justice and protection of the marginalized. This act of kindness foreshadows the protective nature of Christ, who safeguards His followers.<p><b>And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled</b><br>Providing access to water was a significant gesture of hospitality and care in the arid climate of Israel. This invitation signifies inclusion and acceptance, as Ruth is allowed to share in the resources of the workers. It reflects the biblical theme of God's provision and the living water offered by Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, where Jesus offers the Samaritan woman living water. This act of kindness by Boaz prefigures the grace and generosity of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by returning with her to Bethlehem.

This is practical&#8212;she will know exactly where to glean&#8212;but it is also protective, keeping her from wandering into unsafe territory (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Focusing on one field pictures single-minded devotion. Just as believers are urged to &#8220;fix our eyes on Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>) and &#8220;set your minds on things above&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>), Ruth is told to concentrate on the place of provision God has arranged for her.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and follow along after these girls</b><p>&#8226; Boaz places Ruth with his own female servants. By joining their orderly progression behind the reapers, Ruth will gather more grain and be integrated into the community (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Submission to Boaz&#8217;s instructions models humble obedience&#8212;Ruth does not demand a privileged position but willingly walks in the path provided, echoing <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>: &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you</b><p>&#8226; Ancient fields could be dangerous for an unattached woman (cf. <a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-24</a>). Boaz uses his authority to guarantee Ruth&#8217;s safety, reflecting God&#8217;s heart to protect the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores moral boundaries: the men may not harass, intimidate, or exploit her. It prefigures the church&#8217;s call to treat one another &#8220;with absolute purity&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when you are thirsty</b><p>&#8226; Boaz anticipates Ruth&#8217;s needs before she voices them, mirroring the Lord who &#8220;knows what you need before you ask Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-8.htm">Matthew 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; In a hot Judean harvest, water is life. Ruth is invited to refresh herself freely, just as Jesus later offers &#8220;living water&#8221; to the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>go and drink from the jars the young men have filled</b><p>&#8226; Inverting social expectations, Boaz lets a foreign gleaner share what hired men have drawn. Grace supersedes rank (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Ruth does not have to fetch her own water; provision is ready. This foreshadows how Christ supplies every spiritual need (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction also promotes community: Ruth will stand beside Boaz&#8217;s workers, erasing barriers of ethnicity and status (<a href="/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/2-9.htm">Ruth 2:9</a> reveals Boaz&#8217;s generous, protective leadership and God&#8217;s covenant-faithfulness working through him. Ruth is told where to look, whom to follow, how she will be safeguarded, and where to find refreshment. The verse invites believers to keep their eyes on God&#8217;s appointed field, walk in humility among His people, trust His protection from harm, and receive the ready refreshment He provides through His grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Have drawn.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">shall </span>(<span class= "ital">from time to time</span>)<span class= "ital"> draw. </span>Possibly from that self-same well at Bethlehem from which David desired to drink (<a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm" title="And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!">2Samuel 23:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Boaz continues his talk, led on by an interest that was, probably, surprising to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Let thine eyes be on the field which they are reaping.</span> He feels increasingly anxious concerning the fascinating stranger, and gives her excellent counsel.

When the water was drawn by the young men, then the maidens would carry the filled jars upon their heads to the resting-place. Gleaners could not be expected to get the freedom of the water which was thus so laboriously drawn, and then fatiguingly carried from a distance. But Boaz made Ruth free, and thus conferred on her a distinguishing privilege, that must have been at once most acceptable and most valuable. The Vulgate renders the last clause too freely - "of which the young men 'drink.'" The familiar well referred-to "<span class="accented">appears</span>," says Dean Stanley, "close by the gate" of the town ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 163). Yet not very close. "<span class="accented">It is</span>," says Dr. John Wilson, "less than half a mile distant from the present village, and is in a rude enclosure, and consists of a large cistern with several small apertures" ('Lands of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 399). Dr. Wilson has no doubt of its identity, though Dr. Robinson hesitated to come to the same conclusion ('Researches, ' vol. 2. p. 158). <p> CHAPTER 2:10-17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Let] your eyes [be on]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;na&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124;
