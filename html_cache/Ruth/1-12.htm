This reflects the cultural norm of the time, where widows would often return to their father's house for support. Naomi's use of "my daughters" indicates a deep familial bond, despite the lack of blood relation. This phrase also highlights the theme of loyalty and family ties, which is central to the Book of Ruth.<p><b>Go on, for I am too old to have another husband.</b><br>Naomi acknowledges her advanced age, which in the cultural context of ancient Israel, would make remarriage unlikely. This reflects the societal expectations and limitations placed on widows. Naomi's statement underscores her sense of hopelessness and the practical realities of her situation, as she cannot provide new husbands for her daughters-in-law through Levirate marriage, a practice where a brother of a deceased man would marry the widow to continue the family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>).<p><b>Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,</b><br>Naomi presents a hypothetical scenario to emphasize the improbability of her situation. The mention of "hope" contrasts with her earlier expression of despair, highlighting the depth of her predicament. The reference to bearing sons is significant in the context of Levirate marriage, as it would be necessary for her to have sons to provide husbands for Orpah and Ruth. This phrase also foreshadows the miraculous provision and redemption that will come later in the narrative, pointing to God's providence and the eventual lineage leading to King David and ultimately to Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem who moved to Moab during a famine.

Acknowledging her age and the improbability of providing husbands according to levirate custom, she urges them to return home for their own welfare. The verse showcases sacrificial love, honest appraisal of circumstances, and sets the stage for Ruth&#8217;s extraordinary commitment that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn back, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. But even if I could say, I have hope; yea, even if I had a husband this very night; yea, even if I had already given birth to sons</span>; (ver. 13) <span class="cmt_word">would ye therefore wait till they grew up? would ye therefore shut yourselves up so as not to have husbands? nay, my daughters; for my lot is exceedingly bitter, more than even yours, for the hand of Yahveh has gone out against me.</span> Most pathetic pleading, and not easily reproduced on lines of literal rendering. "Go, for I am too old to have a husband." A euphemistic rendering; but the original is euphemistic too, though under another phraseological phase. "But even if I could say, I have hope." The poverty of the Hebrew verb, in respect of provision to express "moods, ' is conspicuous: "<span class="accented">that</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">suppose</span> that I said, I have hope." Mark the climactic representation. <span class="accented">Firstly</span>, Naomi makes, for argument's sake, the supposition that she might yet have sons; then, <span class="accented">secondly</span>, she carries her supposition much higher, namely, that she might that very night have a husband; and then, <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, she carries the supposition a great deal higher still, namely, that even already her sons were brought forth: "Would you therefore wait?" Note the <span class="accented">therefore</span>. Ibn Ezra, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version assume that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">for them</span>. The feminine pronoun, however, as applied to Naomi's sons, is, on that supposition, all but inexplicable. It is much better to assume, with the majority of modern critics, that it is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, whether we call it a Chaldaism or not. Certainly it was current in Chaldee (see <a href="/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6, 9</a>). But it may have floated in circles of Semitic society that were never included within Chaldaea proper. Indeed, there were no precise limits bounding off the Chaldee language from the kindred dialects, just as there are no such limits in English or in German, or in any member of a linguistic group. Idioms often overlap. In the two interrogative clauses, "Would ye for that purpose wait till they grew up. Would ye for that purpose seclude, yourselves, so as not to have husbands? there is a parallelism; only, in the second clause, the representation rises. "For my lot is exceedingly bitter, more than even yours;" literally, "for it is bitter to me exceedingly, beyond you." The verb is used impersonally. Naomi means that her case was even more lamentable than theirs, so that she could not encourage them to hang their dependence on her help, or to hope for a retrieval of their circumstances in becoming partakers of her fortunes. The translation of King James's version, "for your sakes," though decidedly supported by the Septuagint, is unnatural. Pagnin and Drusius both give the correct rendering, "more than you." So do Michaelis and Wright, But Bertheau and Gesenius agree with King James s version. The Syriac Peshito, strange to say, gives both translations, "I feel very bitterly for you, and to me it is more bitter than to you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Return home,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1444;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my daughters.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7791;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
