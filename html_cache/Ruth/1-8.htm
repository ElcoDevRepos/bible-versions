This reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where women often relied on male relatives for support. Naomi's decision to speak to them highlights her role as the matriarch and her concern for their well-being. The context is set in the time of the judges, a period marked by social and religious upheaval in Israel (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>Go back, each of you to your mother&#8217;s home</b><br>Naomi urges Orpah and Ruth to return to their maternal homes, which suggests a cultural norm where a widow might find refuge and support with her birth family. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of returning to one's family of origin in times of distress. The mention of the "mother's home" rather than the father's may indicate a focus on the nurturing aspect of the family or the role of the mother in arranging future marriages (<a href="/genesis/24-28.htm">Genesis 24:28</a>).<p><b>May the LORD show you loving devotion</b><br>Naomi invokes the name of the LORD (Yahweh), the covenant God of Israel, asking Him to show "loving devotion" or "chesed" to her daughters-in-law. This term encompasses kindness, loyalty, and faithfulness, central themes in the book of Ruth. It reflects the covenantal love God shows to His people, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and His enduring faithfulness throughout Israel's history.<p><b>as you have shown to your dead and to me</b><br>Naomi acknowledges the loyalty and kindness Orpah and Ruth have demonstrated to their deceased husbands and to her. This highlights the theme of loyalty and familial duty, which is a key element in the narrative. Their actions prefigure the selfless love and commitment that Ruth will continue to show, ultimately leading to her inclusion in the lineage of David and, by extension, Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). This foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who embodies perfect loving devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem who moved to Moab during a famine.

She acknowledged that most kindly had they acted toward her. Her heart was filled with gratitude. It was likewise agitated with grief at the prospect of bidding them a final farewell, Nevertheless, she felt that it would be unreasonable and unkind to invite them to be, to any further degree, sharers of her adversity. Hence, thanking them for their loving convoy, she would remind them that every step further on would only increase the length of their return-journey; and she said, Go, return each to her mother's home. There, in the females' apartment, and in the bosom of their mothers, they would surely find a welcome and a refuge. She judges of their mothers by herself, and she refers rather to them than to their fathers, partly, perhaps, because she bears in mind her own motherhood, but principally, no doubt, because, in those Oriental countries, it lay very particularly within the province of mothers to make arrangements in reference to their daughters. <span class="cmt_word">May Yahveh deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the deceased, and with me.</span> It is beautiful gratitude, and at the same time a touching monument to the faithfulness and gentleness that had characterized and adorned the young widows. Her simple Hebrew theology, moreover, comes finely out. She assumes that her own Yahveh reigned in Moab as in Judah, and that all blessing descended from him. There is a little peculiarity in the Hebrew pronouns in this clause. They are masculine instead of feminine. The influence of the stronger sex overrides grammatically, for the moment, the influence of the weaker. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Naomi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5281.htm">Strong's 5281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naomi -- mother-in-law of Ruth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
