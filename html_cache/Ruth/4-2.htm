The number ten is significant as it often represents completeness or a quorum in Jewish tradition, such as in a minyan, the quorum required for certain religious obligations. Boaz's choice to gather ten elders underscores the importance and formality of the proceedings. This gathering reflects the legal and communal practices of the time, where elders would serve as witnesses to transactions and agreements, ensuring that the actions taken were recognized and binding within the community.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's directive to the elders to "sit here" indicates his authority and the respect he commanded within the community. Sitting was a posture of deliberation and judgment, suggesting that a formal legal proceeding was about to take place. This setting at the city gate, a common place for legal matters and public business, highlights the transparency and public nature of the transaction. The city gate was a central location where justice was administered, and community issues were addressed, as seen in other biblical accounts such as in the story of Lot in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>.<p><b>and they did so.</b><br>The elders' compliance with Boaz's request demonstrates their recognition of the importance of the matter at hand and their respect for Boaz. Their willingness to participate also reflects the communal nature of decision-making in ancient Israel, where the involvement of respected leaders lent legitimacy to the proceedings. This act of sitting and witnessing would ensure that the transaction was conducted according to the law and customs of the time, providing a legal and social framework for the redemption process that Boaz was about to undertake.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A prominent and wealthy man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a kinsman-redeemer for Ruth.
