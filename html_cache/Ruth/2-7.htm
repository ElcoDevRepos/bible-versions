Ruth, a Moabite and a widow, was exercising her right under this law, demonstrating her humility and willingness to work for sustenance. This act of gleaning also highlights the provision God made for the marginalized in society. Ruth's request to glean "among the sheaves" suggests she sought permission to gather not just the leftovers on the ground but also among the bundles, indicating her boldness and initiative. This foreshadows her role in God's redemptive plan, as she becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p><b>So she came out and has continued from morning until now,</b><br>Ruth's dedication and work ethic are evident as she labors from morning until the present time. This reflects her character as industrious and diligent, qualities that earn her favor in the eyes of Boaz, the field owner. Her perseverance is a testament to her commitment to Naomi, her mother-in-law, and her determination to provide for them both. This phrase also underscores the theme of divine providence, as Ruth's hard work places her in the path of Boaz, a kinsman-redeemer, who plays a crucial role in her life and the continuation of Naomi's family line.<p><b>except that she rested a short time in the shelter.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of Ruth taking a short rest in the shelter indicates the harsh conditions of fieldwork and the necessity of rest even for the most diligent workers. The shelter likely provided shade and a place for workers to recuperate, emphasizing the humane treatment of laborers in Boaz's fields. This detail highlights Boaz's character as a compassionate and just landowner, aligning with the biblical principle of caring for workers (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>). Ruth's brief rest also symbolizes the temporary nature of her struggles, as God is orchestrating a greater plan for her life, leading to her eventual rest and security through her marriage to Boaz.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by returning with her to Bethlehem.

Together these traits commend a lifestyle that unites reverence for Scripture with practical obedience, encouraging believers to approach every opportunity&#8212;no matter how ordinary&#8212;with godly courtesy, steadfast effort, and balanced dependence on the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - The steward continues his account of Ruth. She had respectfully solicited leave to glean. <span class="cmt_word">She said, Let me glean, I pray thee, and gather in bundles after the reapers.</span> The expression, "and gather in bundles," is in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> and is rendered in King James's version, as also by Coverdale, Tremellius, Castellio, Luther, Michaelis, "and gather among" or "beside the sheaves." But such a request on the part of Ruth would seem to be too bold, the more especially as we find Boaz afterwards giving instructions to the young men to allow her, without molestation, to glean "even between the sheaves" (ver. 15). Hence Pagnin's free version is to be preferred, "<span class="accented">and</span> gather bundles" (<span class="accented">et congregabo manipulos</span>). Carpzov pleads for the same interpretation, and translates thus: "Let me, I pray thee, glean, and collect the gleanings into bundles (<span class="accented">colligam obsecro spicas</span>, <span class="accented">collectasque accumulem in manipules</span>). Montanus too adopts it, and Raabe likewise (<span class="accented">und sammele zu Haufen</span>). The steward praises Ruth s industry. <span class="cmt_word">And she came, and has remained ever since the morning until just now.</span> She had worked with scarcely any intermission, diligently, from early morning. Drusius says that the following expression, rendered in King James's version <span class="cmt_word">that she tarried a little in the house,</span> occasioned him critical torture (<span class="accented">locus hie et diu et acriter me torsit</span>). Coverdale also had been inextricably perplexed. He renders it, "<span class="accented">And</span> within a litel whyle she wolde have bene gone home <span class="accented">agayne</span>." The word house troubled these and many other interpreters, as if the reference were to Naomi s dwelling-house in the town. The reference, however, is evidently to a temporary but, shed, tent, or booth erected in the harvest-field for the siesta of the workers, and the accommodation of the master, when he was visiting by day, or exercising supervision by night. We would translate the clause thus - "Her resting at the but (has been) little." Her siesta in the shade of the but was trot brief. She felt as if she could not afford a long repose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She has said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
