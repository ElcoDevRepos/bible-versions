Moab was a region east of the Dead Sea, often at odds with Israel. The Moabites descended from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and their relationship with Israel was complex, involving both conflict and cooperation. Naomi's return signifies a move from a place of loss and foreignness back to her homeland, symbolizing repentance and restoration. This return is reminiscent of the prodigal son&#8217;s return in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, highlighting themes of redemption and hope.<p><b>with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess</b><br>Ruth's identity as a Moabitess is crucial, emphasizing her foreign status and the cultural barriers she faces. Despite being a Moabite, Ruth's loyalty to Naomi and her faith in the God of Israel set her apart. Her inclusion in the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) underscores the theme of God's grace extending beyond Israel. Ruth's story prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>And they arrived in Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is significant both geographically and theologically. It is the birthplace of King David (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>) and later Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). The arrival in Bethlehem sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan. The town's name foreshadows the provision and sustenance that will come through Ruth's story, ultimately leading to the birth of the Messiah.<p><b>at the beginning of the barley harvest</b><br>The timing of their arrival is providential, as the barley harvest marks a season of renewal and provision. This period, occurring around April, is significant for the unfolding narrative, as it provides the setting for Ruth's meeting with Boaz (<a href="/ruth/2.htm">Ruth 2:1-3</a>). The harvest symbolizes new beginnings and God's provision, paralleling the spiritual renewal and hope that Naomi and Ruth will experience. The harvest theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the fields being ripe for harvest (<a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>), symbolizing the readiness of people to receive the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who, after the death of her husband and sons in Moab, returns to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law Ruth.
