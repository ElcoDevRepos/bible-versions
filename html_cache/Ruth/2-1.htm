In ancient Israel, family lineage and tribal affiliation were crucial for identity and inheritance rights. The mention of a relative sets the stage for the concept of the kinsman-redeemer, a key theme in the Book of Ruth. This role, outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, involved a family member stepping in to support relatives in need, often by marrying a widow to preserve the family line.<p><b>a prominent man of noble character</b><br>Boaz is described as a man of noble character, indicating his integrity, wealth, and social standing. The Hebrew term "gibbor chayil" can imply both wealth and valor, suggesting that Boaz was not only financially prosperous but also respected for his moral and ethical conduct. This character trait is significant as it foreshadows his role as a redeemer and protector, reflecting the qualities of righteousness and kindness that are central to the narrative.<p><b>from the clan of Elimelech</b><br>The mention of the clan of Elimelech ties Boaz to Naomi and Ruth through familial and tribal connections. In the tribal society of ancient Israel, clans were extended family groups that provided social and economic support. This connection is crucial for the unfolding of the story, as it legitimizes Boaz's potential role as a kinsman-redeemer. The clan system also reflects the importance of maintaining family heritage and property within the tribe, as seen in <a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7-9</a>.<p><b>whose name was Boaz</b><br>The name Boaz means "strength" or "in him is strength," which is fitting given his role in the narrative. Boaz's actions throughout the Book of Ruth demonstrate strength of character and faithfulness to God's laws. His name also appears in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, highlighting his significance in the lineage of David and ultimately the Messiah. Boaz serves as a type of Christ, embodying the role of a redeemer who provides protection and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow who returned to Bethlehem from Moab after the death of her husband and sons.

It may be noted that the difficulty of date may be lessened by supposing that in the last two generations we have children of their fathers' old age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naomi had, on her husband's side, a friend.</span> The C'tib reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (absolute <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span>) is much to be preferred to the K'ri <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> is ambiguous in import. It primarily means <span class="accented">known</span>, <span class="accented">well-known</span>, <span class="accented">acquainted</span>, <span class="accented">an acquaintance</span> (see <a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8, 18</a>). But as intimate acquaintances, especially in a primitive and comparatively unwelded state of society, are generally found within the circle of kinsfolk, the word may be used, and is here used, in reference to a <span class="accented">kinsman</span>. The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">consanguineus</span>. The translation is interpretatively correct; but the original term is less definite, and hence, in virtue of the ambiguity, there is not absolute redundancy in the appended clause, <span class="accented">of the family</span> or <span class="accented">elan of Elimelech</span>. This friend of Naomi on her husband s side is said, in King James's version, to be <span class="cmt_word">a mighty man of wealth.</span> But the expression so rendered has, in the very numerous passages in which it occurs, a conventional import that stretches out in a different and nobler direction. It is the expression that is so frequently translated "<span class="accented">a</span> mighty man of valor (see <a href="/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>, etc.). In only one other passage is it rendered as it is by King James's translators in the passage before us, viz., in <a href="/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>. There it is correctly so translated, interpretatively. Here there seems to be a leaning in the same direction, and yet it is not strongly pronounced. Cassel, however, takes the other cue, and translates "a valiant hero "Probably," says he "he had distinguished himself in the conflicts of Israel with their enemies." The expression originally means "strong in strength" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">Sept</span>.), but is ambiguous in consequence of the many-sided import of the latter word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which means originally, either <span class="accented">strength</span>, and then <span class="accented">valor</span>; or, <span class="accented">clannish following</span> (see Raabe), and then <span class="accented">military host</span>, or <span class="accented">force</span>, or <span class="accented">forces</span>; also, <span class="accented">faculty</span> or <span class="accented">ability</span>, and then, as so often "answering all things," <span class="accented">riches</span> or <span class="accented">wealth</span>. The idea the writer seems to be that the friend of the widow's husband <span class="accented">was a strong and substantial yeoman</span>. He was <span class="cmt_word">of the family or clan of Elimelech.</span> The word <span class="accented">family</span> is conventionally too narrow, and the word <span class="accented">elan</span> too broad, to represent the import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> as here used. The idea intended lies somewhere between. <span class="cmt_word">And his name was Boaz.</span> The root of this name is not found, apparently, in Hebrew, as was supposed by the older philologists, and hence its essential idea is as yet undetermined. Raabe finds its original form in the Sanscrit <span class="accented">bhuvanti</span>, which yields the idea of <span class="accented">prosperousness</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Naomi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
