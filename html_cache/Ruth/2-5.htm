His inquiry shows his active involvement in the management of his fields, a sign of a responsible and diligent landowner. The foreman, or overseer, was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the harvest, indicating a structured and organized approach to agriculture in ancient Israel. This reflects the agrarian society of the time, where landowners like Boaz played a crucial role in the community's economy and social structure.<p><b>&#8220;Whose young woman is this?&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's question highlights the cultural context of identity and belonging in ancient Israel. Women were often identified by their relationship to a male figure, such as a father or husband. This reflects the patriarchal society where lineage and family connections were significant. The question also indicates Boaz's immediate interest in Ruth, setting the stage for their future relationship. Ruth, a Moabite, was gleaning in the fields, a practice allowed by Mosaic Law to provide for the poor and foreigners (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). This moment foreshadows Ruth's integration into the Israelite community and her eventual role in the lineage of David and Jesus Christ, highlighting themes of redemption and inclusion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.

Like a shepherd who knows the state of his flock (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>), he notices every detail.<p>&#8226; His question shows personal involvement, echoing godly leaders such as Moses who &#8220;went out to his own people and observed their hard labor&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often presents God&#8217;s servants as initiators of care: the good Samaritan &#8220;came to him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>); Jesus &#8220;saw a large crowd and had compassion&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>). Boaz models that same alert, compassionate leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the foreman of his harvesters</b><p>&#8226; Boaz works through proper channels, respecting the authority of the overseer he has appointed&#8212;similar to Jethro&#8217;s advice that Moses delegate trustworthy men (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of an organized workforce highlights the blessing on Boaz&#8217;s fields (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>). Orderly stewardship of resources is portrayed elsewhere, such as Joseph managing Pharaoh&#8217;s grain (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46-49</a>).<p>&#8226; Boaz follows God&#8217;s commands for harvest time: leaving portions for the poor and the foreigner (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>).

Boaz wants to know under whose protection Ruth stands.<p>&#8226; The question underscores Ruth&#8217;s vulnerability as a widow and foreigner (<a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>). God repeatedly commands His people to defend such individuals (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Boaz&#8217;s interest foreshadows redemption: just as he will later spread his cloak over Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>), Christ &#8220;gave Himself for us to redeem us&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Identity and belonging are themes woven through Scripture. Believers are asked, &#8220;To whom do you belong?&#8221; and find the answer in <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, &#8220;To all who received Him, He gave the right to become children of God.&#8221; Boaz&#8217;s inquiry hints at that larger gospel reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Boaz&#8217;s single question reveals much: an attentive, compassionate man of faith observing his workers; a structured, law-honoring workplace; and concern for a vulnerable outsider who will soon experience covenant love. This verse introduces the human agent through whom God will extend provision and redemption, pointing forward to the greater Redeemer who likewise notices, questions, and claims those who need His shelter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Boaz said to the young man who was set over the reapers, Whose is that young woman!</span> His eye had been instantaneously arrested by the handsome stranger.

It is too Rabbinic, however, and artificial, finical, bizarre, to suppose with the same Jewish annotator that Boaz would notice with admiration that, while she picked up zealously all available couples of stalks, she left the triplets in the field unappropriated! The question which he put to the overseer is not who but <span class="accented">whose is that young woman!</span> She had not the gait or air of an ordinary pauper, and hence he wondered if she could belong to any of the families in Bethlehem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Boaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#8216;az)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1162.htm">Strong's 1162: </a> </span><span class="str2">Boaz -- 'quickness', an ancestor of David, also a pillar before the temple</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
