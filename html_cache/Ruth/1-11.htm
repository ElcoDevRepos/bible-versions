Her reply is a response to her daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah, who initially express their desire to accompany her back to Bethlehem after the death of their husbands. Naomi's response is filled with a sense of resignation and practicality, reflecting the dire circumstances she faces as a widow in a foreign land.<p><b>Return home, my daughters.</b><br>Naomi's use of "my daughters" indicates a deep affection and familial bond with Ruth and Orpah, despite their Moabite origin. The term "return home" suggests a cultural expectation for widows to return to their father's house or seek new marriages within their own community. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern customs where family and kinship ties were crucial for survival and social stability.<p><b>Why would you go with me?</b><br>Naomi questions the logic of Ruth and Orpah accompanying her, highlighting the bleak prospects she can offer them. This rhetorical question underscores Naomi's awareness of her inability to provide for them, as she herself is returning to Bethlehem in a state of poverty and uncertainty. It also reflects the cultural norm that a widow's best chance for security was through remarriage.<p><b>Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands?</b><br>This phrase refers to the practice of levirate marriage, where a man would marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). Naomi is pointing out the impossibility of providing new husbands for Ruth and Orpah, as she has no more sons. This highlights the cultural and legal structures of the time, which placed significant importance on lineage and inheritance. Naomi's rhetorical question emphasizes her hopelessness and the lack of future prospects for her daughters-in-law if they remain with her.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem who moved to Moab with her husband and sons during a famine.

Having heard the offer of loyalty from her daughters-in-law (<a href="/ruth/1-10.htm">Ruth 1:10</a>), she turns to speak plainly. Like Abraham who &#8220;rose and went&#8221; when God directed him (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>), Naomi exercises leadership by making a hard call. Her words aren&#8217;t harsh; they&#8217;re protective. She recognizes the realism of their situation in Moab and seeks their best interest.<p>Key ideas<p>&#8226; Leadership sometimes means dissuading people when the path ahead is harsher than they realize (cf. <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s honesty prepares the ground for genuine faith decisions, much as Jesus&#8217; frank words sifted followers in <a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60-66</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Return home, my daughters</b><p>The invitation is tender: she calls them &#8220;my daughters,&#8221; not outsiders. Yet she urges them to &#8220;return home.&#8221; The same verb sh&#251;b, &#8220;turn back,&#8221; dominates this chapter (<a href="/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16</a>, 21). Naomi&#8217;s plea stresses the sensible option: stay where life and family networks remain. Abraham left family for promise (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>); here Naomi tells them to stay for survival.<p>Consider<p>&#8226; Ruth and Orpah face a fork in the road reminiscent of <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>&#8212;choose whom you will serve.<p>&#8226; In telling them to go, Naomi models self-denial, echoing <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>, looking to the interests of others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why would you go with me?</b><p>Naomi presses the rhetorical question, exposing the cost. Going with her means embracing widowhood, poverty, and uncertain status in Bethlehem. Like Jesus&#8217; question &#8220;Do you also want to go away?&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-67.htm">John 6:67</a>), Naomi&#8217;s inquiry invites heart examination.<p>Highlights<p>&#8226; True commitment endures when every practical incentive is removed (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s realism counters any romantic notion of faith; discipleship is costly (<a href="/luke/9-57.htm">Luke 9:57-62</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands?</b><p>Under the Levirate custom (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>) a brother-in-law could marry the widow to preserve the family line. Naomi bluntly states the impossibility: she has no more sons, nor prospects of bearing any. Her statement underscores utter hopelessness in human terms.<p>Implications<p>&#8226; Salvation&#8217;s answer cannot arise from human ability; God must intervene (compare <a href="/genesis/18-11.htm">Genesis 18:11-14</a> about Sarah&#8217;s barrenness).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s emptiness sets the stage for God to fill, foreshadowing the eventual birth of Obed, grandfather of David (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-17</a>), and ultimately Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/1-11.htm">Ruth 1:11</a> captures Naomi&#8217;s compassionate, clear-eyed counsel to her daughters-in-law. She loves them enough to urge the sensible route, highlighting the cost of attaching themselves to her. The verse exposes human emptiness and paves the way for God&#8217;s unexpected provision. Where human resources end, divine redemption begins.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) The advice of Naomi thus far is insufficient to shake the affectionate resolve of the two women. She then paints the loneliness of her lot. She has no more sons, and can hope for none; nay, if sons were to be even now born to her, what good would that do them? Still her lot is worse than theirs. They, in spite of their great loss, are young, and from their mothers' houses they may again go forth to homes of their own. She, old, childless, and solitary, must wend her weary way back to live unaided as best she may.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naomi said, Turn back, my daughters. To what purpose should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that might be husbands to you?</span> According to the old Levirate law - a survival of rude and barbarous times - Orpah and Ruth, having had husbands who died without issue, would have been entitled to claim marriage with their husbands' brothers, if such surviving brothers there had been (see <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-9</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24-28</a>). And if the surviving brothers were too young to be married, the widows, if they chose, might wait on till they reached maturity (see <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>.). It is in the light of these customs that we are to read Naomi's remonstrance's. The phraseology in the second interrogation is very primitive, and primitively ' agglutinative.' "Are there yet to be sons in my womb, and they shall be to you for husbands?" (see on ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Naomi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5281.htm">Strong's 5281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naomi -- mother-in-law of Ruth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
