Lying at his feet was a cultural gesture of humility and submission, not an act of impropriety. The threshing floor was a public place, and Ruth's actions were in line with the customs of the time, seeking protection and provision through a kinsman-redeemer. This act can be seen as a type of the believer's submission to Christ, seeking refuge and redemption.<p><b>but she got up before anyone else could recognize her</b><br>Ruth's early departure underscores the importance of maintaining her and Boaz's reputations. In a small community like Bethlehem, where everyone knew each other, discretion was crucial. This action reflects the biblical principle of avoiding even the appearance of evil (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>). It also highlights Ruth's wisdom and integrity, ensuring that no misunderstanding could arise from her presence at the threshing floor.<p><b>Then Boaz said, &#8220;Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's instruction to keep Ruth's visit confidential demonstrates his protective nature and concern for her honor. In the cultural context, a woman's presence at the threshing floor could be misinterpreted, potentially damaging her reputation. Boaz's actions reflect his righteousness and foreshadow Christ's role as a protector and redeemer of His people.

(Henry.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she lay at the place of his feet until morning: and she arose ere yet a man could distinguish his neighbor.</span> In the original it is "<span class="accented">the</span> places of his feet" (see ver. 4). Time would rapidly fly past. Sleep there would be none to either the one or the other. In mutual modesty they guarded each other's honor. Thoughts and feelings, narratives and projects, would be freely interchanged. Their mutual understanding would become complete. At length there began to be the first faint tinge of paleness streaking into the dark. Ruth arose, and prepared to depart. It is added, <span class="cmt_word">For he had said,</span> - or, more literally, "And he had said," - <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be known that 'the' woman came to the threshing-floor.</span> This has been to critics a puzzling clause. The conjunction in the foreground, a mere copulative, has occasioned difficulty. It is thoroughly Hebraistic. But of course it does not here introduce to notice something merely added to what goes before, of the nature of a parting injunction or request addressed to Ruth. The articulated phrase "<span class="accented">the</span> woman," as distinguished from "a woman," the expression in King James's version, renders such an interpretation impossible. The Targumist explains thus: "<span class="accented">and</span> he said <span class="accented">to his young men</span>." But the whole tenor of the preceding narrative proceeds on the assumption that there were no servants on the premises or at hand. Other Rabbis, and after them Luther and Cover-dale, interpret thus: "and he said <span class="accented">in his</span> heart," or, "<span class="accented">and</span> he thought." Unnatural. The difficulty is to be credited, or debited, to simplicity of composition, and the habit of just adding thing to thing aggregatively, instead of interweaving them into a complex unity. In the course of their many interchanges of thought and feeling, Boaz had expressed a desire, both for Ruth s sake and for his own, that it should not be known that she had come by night to the threshing-floor. The narrator, instead of introducing this expression of desire in the way in which it would directly fall from the lips of Boaz, "<span class="accented">Let</span> it not be known that <span class="accented">thou</span> didst come," gives it in the indirect form of speech, the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> his own statement of the case. It is as if he had introduced a parenthesis or added a note in the margin. The <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> -instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>- was most probably not a later form, as Berthean supposes, but an older Hebrew form that had died out of use long before the days of the Masorites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So she lay down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
