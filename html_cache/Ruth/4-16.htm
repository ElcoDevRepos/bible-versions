This act signifies a turning point in her life, symbolizing hope and redemption. The child is a direct result of the levirate marriage between Ruth and Boaz, which was a cultural practice to preserve family lineage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). Naomi's involvement highlights the importance of family and community in God's plan.<p><b>placed him on her lap</b><br>This gesture is one of affection and acceptance, indicating Naomi's role in the child's life. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, placing a child on one's lap could symbolize adoption or claiming the child as one's own. This act also reflects the deep bond and love within the family, as Naomi embraces her role as grandmother. It is reminiscent of other biblical instances where children are blessed or claimed, such as Jacob blessing his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-12.htm">Genesis 48:12</a>).<p><b>and became a nurse to him</b><br>Naomi's role as a nurse, or caregiver, emphasizes her active participation in the child's upbringing. This reflects the communal nature of child-rearing in ancient Israel, where extended family members played significant roles. The term "nurse" here does not imply breastfeeding but rather a nurturing and guiding presence. This nurturing role can be seen as a type of God's care for His people, providing guidance and support. Naomi's involvement also foreshadows the significant role Obed will play as the grandfather of King David, linking to the Messianic lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Ruth, Naomi is Ruth's mother-in-law.

The literal action&#8212;&#8220;Naomi took the child&#8221;&#8212;signals a tangible reversal of her earlier lament, &#8220;Do not call me Naomi&#8230; call me Mara&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The child is Obed, the direct gift of God through the kinsman-redeemer Boaz and Ruth&#8217;s obedience (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>). Just as Sarah held Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21-2.htm">Genesis 21:2</a>), and Simeon later &#8220;took Him in his arms&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-28.htm">Luke 2:28</a>) celebrating fulfilled promise, Naomi&#8217;s embrace showcases the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to restore what was lost (<a href="/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Placed him on her lap</b><p>&#8226; In the ancient household, a lap symbolized ownership, affection, and formal acceptance into the family. Job remembered tender care &#8220;knees to receive me&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a>), and Isaiah pictures God&#8217;s people comforted &#8220;on the lap&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s lap becomes the safe space where covenant blessings touch everyday life. The gesture publicly affirms the child&#8217;s legal place in Elimelech&#8217;s line, fulfilling the goal of levirate redemption stated earlier by Boaz (<a href="/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It also answers Naomi&#8217;s earlier prayer that Ruth would find &#8220;rest&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a>). Now Ruth&#8217;s rest is secure, and Naomi&#8217;s lap displays the peace that flows from God&#8217;s orderly design for family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Became a nurse to him</b><p>&#8226; The renders, &#8220;and became a nurse to him.&#8221; Naomi steps into an ongoing role&#8212;not merely babysitting but nurturing, guiding, and mentoring.

While biologically Ruth&#8217;s child, Obed is covenantally Naomi&#8217;s, illustrating how God weaves households together for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s nurturing sets the stage for Obed to father Jesse, and Jesse to father David (<a href="/ruth/4-17.htm">Ruth 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), ultimately pointing to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5&#8211;6, 16</a>).
