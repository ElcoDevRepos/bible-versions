This relationship is significant as it highlights the familial bonds and loyalty that transcend cultural and national boundaries. Naomi, originally from Bethlehem, had moved to Moab due to famine and returned after the death of her husband and sons. Her dialogue with Ruth shows her concern and care, reflecting the deep bond they share. This moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan.<p><b>My daughter</b><br>The term "my daughter" is a term of endearment and indicates the close relationship between Naomi and Ruth. It reflects the familial love and acceptance Naomi has for Ruth, despite Ruth being a Moabite. This phrase also underscores the theme of inclusion and acceptance found throughout the book, as Ruth, a foreigner, is embraced into the Israelite community.<p><b>Should I not seek a resting place for you</b><br>The concept of a "resting place" refers to security and stability, often associated with marriage in the ancient Near Eastern context. Naomi's question implies her responsibility and desire to ensure Ruth's future well-being. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where family members sought to provide for the widows among them. The idea of rest is also a recurring biblical theme, symbolizing peace and fulfillment, which can be seen in the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>That it may be well with you</b><br>Naomi's concern is for Ruth's welfare and prosperity. This phrase indicates her desire for Ruth to have a secure and prosperous future, which in the cultural context of the time, would typically be achieved through marriage. The well-being of individuals is a recurring theme in Scripture, often linked to obedience to God's commandments and His blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). Naomi's actions are a demonstration of selfless love and care, pointing to the greater love and provision found in God's covenant relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>Ruth's mother-in-law, a widow who returned to Bethlehem from Moab after the death of her husband and sons.

Naomi was quick to note the varying '<span class="accented">nuances</span> of feeling, and said "<span class="accented">My</span> daughter, shall I not seek out for thee a rest?" The expression <span class="accented">rest</span>, or <span class="accented">resting-place</span>, though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was <span class="accented">a home</span> to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections. "That it may be well with thee," or, "which shall (or may) be good for thee." Either translation is warrantable and excellent. The latter is the most simple, and is given by Carpzov and Rosenm&uuml;ller; but the former is in accordance with a frequent idiomatic use of the expression, in which there is a change <span class="accented">from the relative in result to the relative in aim</span>, so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3, 18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-11.htm">Deuteronomy 10:11</a>, 25, 28). Naomi did not distinguish between <span class="accented">rests</span> that would be 'good, ' and other <span class="accented">rests</span> which would not be 'good.' Nor did she moralize on the idea of a <span class="accented">rest</span>, and affirm that it would be 'good' for her widowed daughter-in-law. She assumed that <span class="accented">every</span> true <span class="accented">rest</span> was 'good,' and, on the basis of that assumption, she sought out one for her devoted Ruth. Hence the superiority of the rendering that expresses <span class="accented">aim</span> to that which expresses the mere prediction of <span class="accented">result</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day Ruth&#8217;s mother-in-law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
