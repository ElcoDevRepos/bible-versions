His birth is a fulfillment of God's providence and faithfulness, as seen in the story of Ruth, a Moabite woman who becomes part of the Israelite community. This inclusion highlights God's grace and the breaking of ethnic barriers, as Ruth, a foreigner, is integrated into the covenant community. Obed's role as the father of Jesse places him in the genealogical line leading to King David, establishing the importance of his birth in the divine plan. This lineage is also significant in the context of the Messianic prophecy, as it sets the stage for the coming of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David."<p><b>and Jesse was the father of David</b><br>Jesse, the son of Obed, is a key figure in the history of Israel as the father of David, the second king of Israel. David's anointing by the prophet Samuel, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy. David's reign is characterized by his heart for God, despite his personal failings, and he is remembered as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The Davidic Covenant, found in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promises that David's throne will be established forever, a prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the eternal King. The connection between Jesse and David underscores the theme of God's sovereign choice and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through seemingly ordinary individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed.htm">Obed</a></b><br>The son of Boaz and Ruth, Obed is significant as the grandfather of King David.

What began with famine, loss, and foreign relocation ends with a new branch in Israel&#8217;s family tree.<p>&#8226; This phrase roots Obed firmly in real time and space, underscoring that God&#8217;s promises unfold through actual people and families (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Obed links the Moabite outsider Ruth to Israel&#8217;s destiny, revealing how God weaves Gentiles into His redemptive plan (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The genealogy in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-12.htm">1 Chronicles 2:12</a> repeats this exact relationship, reinforcing that Israel&#8217;s historical record and salvation history are one and the same.<p>&#8226; By naming Obed as Jesse&#8217;s father, Scripture highlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness across generations, just as He earlier vowed to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Jesse was the father of David</b><p>&#8220;and Jesse was the father of David&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>)<p>&#8226; Jesse&#8217;s appearance turns our gaze to the shepherd-king David, central to God&#8217;s covenant with Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s line receives an eternal promise: &#8220;Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before Me&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).
