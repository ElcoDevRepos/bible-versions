This reflects the cultural importance of family ties and the role of women in supporting one another. The setting in Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, is significant as it later becomes the birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ, linking Ruth to the Davidic line.<p><b>Naomi asked her, &#8220;How did it go, my daughter?&#8221;</b><br>Naomi's inquiry shows her deep concern and hope for Ruth's future. The term "my daughter" indicates a close, affectionate relationship, transcending the typical mother-in-law and daughter-in-law dynamic. This reflects the Hebrew custom of familial bonds and the importance of kinship. Naomi's question also highlights the suspense and uncertainty surrounding Ruth's encounter with Boaz, a pivotal moment in their redemption story.<p><b>Then Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her.</b><br>Ruth's recounting of Boaz's actions underscores his role as a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a>), where a close relative has the duty to redeem a family member in distress. Boaz's kindness and generosity foreshadow Christ's redemptive work for humanity. This moment also emphasizes the providence of God in orchestrating events for the welfare of His people, a recurring theme in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown great loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi.

Her immediate return shows:<p>&#8211; Obedience to Boaz&#8217;s word, which protected both their reputations (cf. <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Honor toward Naomi; Ruth knows her place is first with the woman God placed over her (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p>&#8211; The rhythm of accountability; she does not act independently but reports to her spiritual family (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene mirrors earlier moments of Ruth&#8217;s loyalty (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16&#8211;17</a>; 2:11). She keeps choosing covenant faithfulness over personal ease, modeling the principle that &#8220;faith without works is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Abraham&#8217;s servant hurried back to tell Isaac all God had done (<a href="/genesis/24-66.htm">Genesis 24:66</a>), Ruth returns with news of providence, reinforcing the pattern of testimony following divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Naomi asked her, &#8220;How did it go, my daughter?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s question is more than polite interest; it seeks to discern God&#8217;s unfolding plan. Similar anticipatory moments appear when Eli asked Hannah, &#8220;May the God of Israel grant your petition&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a>), expecting a gracious outcome.<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;my daughter&#8221; recalls Naomi&#8217;s earlier blessing (<a href="/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>).
