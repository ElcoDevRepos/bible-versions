The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>) and were often in conflict with Israel. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a> states that no Moabite may enter the assembly of the Lord, even to the tenth generation, due to their historical enmity with Israel. This marriage choice reflects the dire circumstances faced by Naomi's family during the famine, leading them to settle in Moab. It also sets the stage for Ruth's eventual integration into the Israelite community, highlighting themes of redemption and God's inclusive plan.<p><b>one named Orpah and the other named Ruth</b><br>Orpah and Ruth, the Moabite women, are central figures in the narrative. Orpah's name is believed to mean "back of the neck," which foreshadows her eventual decision to return to Moab. Ruth, whose name means "friend" or "companion," becomes a key figure in biblical history. Her loyalty and faithfulness to Naomi and the God of Israel are pivotal, leading to her role in the lineage of King David and ultimately Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). Ruth's story exemplifies the theme of God's providence and the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan.<p><b>And after they had lived in Moab about ten years</b><br>The ten-year period in Moab indicates a significant duration of time away from Bethlehem, suggesting a settled life despite being in a foreign land. This timeframe allows for the development of relationships and the deepening of Ruth's commitment to Naomi. The number ten in biblical terms often signifies completeness or a full measure, which may imply that the time in Moab was sufficient for God's purposes to unfold. This period also underscores the severity of the famine in Judah, which forced the family to remain in Moab for so long. The eventual return to Bethlehem marks a turning point in the narrative, setting the stage for Ruth's integration into the Israelite community and God's unfolding plan of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite woman who becomes the daughter-in-law of Naomi.

The fault of settling on a heathen soil begun by the father is carried on by the sons in marrying heathen women, for such we cannot doubt they must have been in the first instance. The Targum (or ancient Chaldee paraphrase) says: "They transgressed against the decree of the Word of the Lord, and took to themselves strange wives." This act was to incur a further risk of being involved in idolatry, as King Solomon found.<p><span class= "bld">Ruth.</span>--This name will mean either "comeliness" or "companion." according to the spelling of which we suppose the present name to be a contraction. The Syriac spelling supports the latter view. Ruth was the wife of Mahlon (<a href="/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a>), apparently the elder sou. The Targum calls Ruth the daughter of Eglon, king of Moab, obviously from the wish to exalt the dignity of Ruth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab.</span> It was their own act. Josephus, reproducing the narrative from memory, represents the event as occurring in the father's lifetime, and as brought about by his arrangement. He says of Elimelech, "Coming into the territory of Moab, he sojourns there, and, things pros-paring according to his mind, he gives in marriage to his sons (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) Moabitish wives." Theological critics have here again raised the question, Was it sinful in these emigrant Hebrews to take in marriage daughters of the land? The Chaldee Targumist did not hesitate in his decision. He begins his paraphrase of the verse, thus - "And they transgressed the edict of the word of the Lord, and took to themselves alien wives of the daughters of Mesh." Dr. Thomas Fuller represents Naomi as passionately remonstrating with her sons. He says of himself, "<span class="accented">My</span> mouth denieth to be the orator of an unjust action." "Nothing can be brought," he adds, "for the defense of these matches. Something may be said for the excuse of them, but that fetched not from piety, but from policy." It is note worthy, however, that in the text itself, and throughout the entire Book, there is nothing of the nature of condemnation, not the least hint of blame. There was a law, indeed, which laid an interdict upon marriages with Canaanites (see <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). But these Canaanites occupied a peculiar relation to the Hebrews. They were within the line of that Canaan which had become the land of Israel. Israelites and Canaanites were thus living within the same borders as rival claimants of the same territory. It was no wonder that the Canaanites' claim was not to be recognized by the Hebrews. The Moabites, however, living within the lines or "coasts" of their own distinct territory, stood in quite a different relation. And while, for purity's sake, great restrictions were to be laid upon all overtures for naturalization (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>), yet the law could never he intended to apply to the families of Hebrews who were settlers in Moab, or to Moabitish females living in their own land, and rather awarding than seeking the prerogatives' of natives. <span class="cmt_word">The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth.</span> No doubt native Moabitish names. Much ingenuity has been expended on that of the more interesting person. Some have unwarrantably assumed that <span class="accented">Ruth</span> is a contraction of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> meaning a <span class="accented">female companion</span> or <span class="accented">friend</span>. Still more unwarrantable, though more captivating to the aesthetic imagination, is the signification which is given to the word by Weruer and Eadie, namely, <span class="accented">beauty</span>. It is founded on an impossible derivation from the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Still more aesthetically captivating is the conjecture of Cassel, that the name is the ancient Semitic form of the Indo-European word <span class="accented">rodon</span> or <span class="accented">rose</span>. "At all events," says he, "the thought of Ruth <span class="accented">as the Rose of Moab</span> is in itself too attractive not to be proposed as a conjecture." It is certainly, most attractive and most admirable as a <span class="accented">jeu d'esprit</span>, but too imaginative to be vindicated on grounds of comparative philology. <span class="cmt_word">And they dwelt there.</span> Or, "settled themselves there; literally, "sat them."
