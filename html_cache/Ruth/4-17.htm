The involvement of the neighbor women highlights the communal joy and shared experiences in Bethlehem. This reflects the cultural practice of women supporting each other during childbirth and significant life events.<p><b>&#8220;A son has been born to Naomi,&#8221;</b><br>Though the child is biologically Ruth's, the women attribute the birth to Naomi, emphasizing the restoration and redemption of Naomi's family line. Naomi, who had previously expressed her bitterness and loss, now experiences joy and fulfillment. This reflects the theme of redemption and God's providence in restoring what was lost.<p><b>and they named him Obed.</b><br>The name Obed means "servant" or "worshiper," which may signify his future role in serving God's purposes. Naming by the community suggests a collective blessing and recognition of the child's significance. This act of naming also underscores the importance of names in Hebrew culture, often reflecting character or destiny.<p><b>He became the father of Jesse,</b><br>Obed's lineage is crucial as it connects to the genealogy of King David. Jesse, his son, would become the father of David, Israel's greatest king. This connection is significant in biblical history, as it sets the stage for the Davidic line, which is central to God's covenant promises.<p><b>the father of David.</b><br>David's lineage is pivotal in biblical prophecy and the messianic expectation. The mention of David here foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, as Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "Son of David."

He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> "Obed," if a participle of the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, naturally means <span class="accented">serving</span>, or <span class="accented">servant</span>. No other derivation, apparently, can at present be assumed (but see Raabe's 'Glossar.'). Josephus gives the participial interpretation as a matter of course, and Jerome too. If the objective correlate of the servitude referred to were Yahveh, then the word might be equivalent to <span class="accented">worshipper</span>. If the name, however, as seems to be the case, was imposed first of all by the matronly neighbors who had come to mingle their joys with those of the mother, and of the grandmother in particular, then it is not likely that there would be an overshadowing reference, either on the one hand to servitude in relation to Yahveh, or on the other to servitude in the abstract. Something simpler would be in harmony with their unsophisticated, impressible, and purely matronly minds. It is not at all unlikely that, in fondling the welcome "<span class="accented">New-</span>come," and congratulating the overjoyed grandmother, they would, with Oriental luxuriance of speech and Oriental overflow of demonstrativeness, speak of the 'lad' as come home to be a faithful <span class="accented">little servant</span> to his most excellent grandmother. The infirmities of advancing age, aggravated by anxieties many, griefs many, bereavements many, toils many, privations many, disappointments many, had been one after another accumulating on "<span class="accented">the</span> dear old lady." But now a sealed fountain of reviving waters had been opened in the wilderness. Might it for many years overflow! Might the oasis around it widen and still widen, till the whole solitary place should be blossoming as the rose! Might the lively little child be spared to minister, with bright activity and devotedness, to the aged pilgrim for the little remainder of her journey! The word which the sympathetic neighbors, with not the least intention to propose a real name, had been affectionately bandying about, while fondling the child, was accepted by Boaz and Ruth. They would say to one another, "Yes, just let him be little <span class="accented">Obed</span> to his loving grandmother." Naomi, soothed in all her motherly and grandmotherly longings and aspirations, would seem to have yielded, resolving, we may suppose, to train the child up to be <span class="accented">a servant of Yahveh</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The neighbor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
