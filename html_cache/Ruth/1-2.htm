His name reflects a theocratic ideal, suggesting a family that acknowledges God's sovereignty.<p><b>his wife&#8217;s name was Naomi</b><br>Naomi means "pleasant" or "delightful." Her name contrasts with the bitterness she later experiences, as seen in <a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a> when she asks to be called Mara, meaning "bitter." This change in name reflects her personal journey and the impact of the events in her life.<p><b>and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion</b><br>Mahlon and Chilion have names that suggest frailty or sickness, with Mahlon possibly meaning "sickly" and Chilion "wasting" or "pining." This foreshadows their early deaths and the subsequent challenges faced by Naomi and Ruth. Their names may also reflect the difficult circumstances of the famine in Bethlehem.<p><b>They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah</b><br>Ephrathites refers to the clan or family group from Ephrathah, an ancient name for Bethlehem (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>). Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is significant as the birthplace of King David and later Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). The mention of Judah situates the narrative within the tribal allotments of Israel, emphasizing the covenantal heritage.<p><b>and they entered the land of Moab and settled there</b><br>Moab was located east of the Dead Sea and was often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>). The decision to settle in Moab during a famine indicates desperation, as Moabites were descendants of Lot and often viewed with suspicion by Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>).

The intermediate i is not the possessive pronoun, but the vowel of union. The name would be originally significant of strong religious Sentiments, perhaps mingled with strong political principles. The imposition of it on a son would be something like a manifesto of the father's creed. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his wife Naomi.</span> Or rather "No-o-mi." The precise import of the word is not absolutely ascertained; but it is probable that it is somewhat abbreviated in its terraination, and means "God is sweet," or, very literally, "Jab is sweetness." It had been originally imposed as a name by some grateful and happy mother, who, by gracious providences, or by other gracious revelations, had been led to think that "sweet are the ways, sweet are the dealings, and sweet is the character of God." The word does not mean <span class="accented">beautiful</span>, as some suppose; nor <span class="accented">gracious</span>, as others suppose; nor <span class="accented">my delight</span>, as others still suppose. It was not intended to describe the character of the person who was to bear the name. It was intended to signalize, in the spirit of a manifesto, a much-prized feature in the Divine character - that feature, namely, that is displayed when "he deals sweetly with men." Gesenius is doubtless right when he makes <span class="accented">sweetness</span> the fundamental idea of the whole group of affiliated words (see his 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in voc</span>.).

In the light of this interpretation, and of it alone, can the full significance of what Naomi said on her return to Bethlehem be apprehended: "Call me not Naomi, call me <span class="accented">Mara</span>: for <span class="accented">the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly</span> with me" (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his two sons.</span> In our idiom we should say, "and the names of his two sons." The two sons, however, were for the moment regarded as a unity among the other units of the household. <span class="cmt_word">Mahlon</span>, or rather "Machlon," <span class="cmt_word">and Chillon.</span> We need not dip deeply into the etymological import of these names, or attach to them, as applied to Elimelech's children, any peculiar significance. The names, unlike those of the parents, are devoid of theological tinge, and, in these modern times at all events, their import is liable to endless debate. One would at the first blush of consideration suppose that the one meant <span class="accented">sickliness</span>, and the other <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption -</span> rather uninteresting and melancholy ideas. But they are peculiarly confounding when we consider that the individuals, so named in our story, had apparently inherited a delicate constitution, which developed in both of them into premature <span class="accented">sickliness and decay</span>. The names have the aspect of being prophetic. And yet, even though we should assume that Elimelech, in virtue of some element of bodily delicacy, was afflicted with feelings of morbid despondency, it is hard to come to the conclusion that he would deliberately stereotype his most hypochondriacal anticipations in the names of his children. The probability is, that the names, as names, would originally have some other import, Dr. Cassel supposes that they meant, respectively, <span class="accented">joy</span> and <span class="accented">ornament</span>; but he trusts to impossible etymologies. Raabe, taking his cue from Sanskrit roots, interprets the one thus "He who brings gifts with him;" and the other thus - "He who conceals his wife in his house." Warner, taking his cue from Chaldea cognates, interprets the former of the two names as meaning <span class="accented">ready to forgive</span>, and the latter as holding forth the idea of <span class="accented">hopeful</span>. All of them unlikely derivations. And yet something quite distinct from the ideas of <span class="accented">sickliness</span> and <span class="accented">consumption</span>, but lying so far on parallel lines of thought, may be conceived. The primary import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, the root of <span class="accented">Machlon</span>, is apparently <span class="accented">to be tender</span>. Thence the word came by one line of thought to mean <span class="accented">to be physically tender</span>, that is, <span class="accented">to be sick</span>; and by another that runs out in Chaldea it came to mean <span class="accented">to be morally teenier</span>, <span class="accented">to be mild or forgiving</span>. Machlon may mean <span class="accented">mildness</span> or <span class="accented">tender-heartedness</span>. Again, the primary idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the root of Chillon, is <span class="accented">to complete</span>. But, besides the completion that is realized in <span class="accented">consuming</span>, <span class="accented">consumption</span>, or <span class="accented">ending</span>, there is moral <span class="accented">completeness</span>, the <span class="accented">completeness</span> or <span class="accented">finish</span> that is realized in <span class="accented">perfection</span> (see <a href="/psalms/119-96.htm">Psalm 119:96</a>: "I have seen an end of all <span class="accented">perfection"</span>). This idea of <span class="accented">beautiful completeness</span>, <span class="accented">or perfection</span>, is more likely to be the meaning of the name than the idea of <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Ephrathitas of Bethlehem Judah.</span> It is not simply the two sons who are so designated. It is the whole group. They were Ephrathites, that is, Bethlehemites, for the old name of Bethlehem was Ephrath, or Ephratha. As, however, the word Ephrathite also meant Ephraimite (see <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; and <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>), it gave precision to the designation, although at the expense of a little redundancy, to say "Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah." <span class="cmt_word">And they came into the country of Moab.</span> The Hebrew emigrants reached the <span class="accented">fields</span> or <span class="accented">pastoral terrgtory</span> of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">And continued there.</span> The phrase in the original is of primitive simplicity - "and were there." It has been asked by theological critics whether Elimelech was justifiable in removing to an "<span class="accented">idolatrous</span> country" to avoid the inconveniences of a famine in the land of his nativity. It is enough to say in reply that there is no hint in the text itself that the step taken was blamable or blamed. "<span class="accented">No</span> man ought," says Lawson, "to be condemned, whether dead or alive, without proofs of guilt; and no certain proofs of guilt appear in the present case." "<span class="accented">The</span> beam of Elimelech's judgment," says Dr. Thomas Fuller, "is <span class="accented">justly</span> weighed down to <span class="accented">go</span> from Bethlehem, Judah, into the land of Moab." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
