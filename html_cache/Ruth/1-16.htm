This reply is significant as it marks a turning point in her life and in the story of Naomi's family. Ruth, a Moabite, is making a conscious decision to align herself with Naomi, an Israelite, which is a profound act of devotion and love.<p><b>Do not urge me to leave you or to turn from following you.</b><br>Ruth's insistence on staying with Naomi highlights the depth of her loyalty. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, family ties were paramount, and Ruth's determination to remain with Naomi, despite the cultural and ethnic differences, underscores her steadfastness. This mirrors the biblical theme of covenant loyalty, akin to God's unwavering faithfulness to His people.<p><b>For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live;</b><br>Ruth's commitment to Naomi is total and unconditional. This phrase reflects the biblical principle of leaving one's past behind to embrace a new future, similar to Abraham's call to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). Ruth's willingness to adopt a new land and lifestyle is a testament to her faith and courage.<p><b>your people will be my people,</b><br>Ruth's declaration to adopt Naomi's people signifies her acceptance of a new identity. This is a profound step, as it involves leaving behind her Moabite heritage. It echoes the biblical theme of inclusion and foreshadows the New Testament message of the Gentiles being grafted into the people of God (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<p><b>and your God will be my God.</b><br>This is the climax of Ruth's declaration, indicating her conversion and acceptance of the God of Israel. In a polytheistic society, choosing to follow the God of Israel was a significant spiritual decision. Ruth's faith is a precursor to the inclusion of Gentiles in the covenant community, and her story is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where all nations are invited to become part of God's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite woman, widow of Mahlon, who demonstrates loyalty and faithfulness to her mother-in-law, Naomi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>An Israelite woman who loses her husband and sons in Moab and decides to return to Bethlehem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A region east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel, where Naomi's family sought refuge during a famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>Naomi's hometown in Judah, known as the "House of Bread," to which she returns with Ruth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The physical and spiritual journey from Moab to Bethlehem, symbolizing Ruth's transition from paganism to faith in the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_commitment.htm">Loyalty and Commitment</a></b><br>Ruth's declaration to Naomi is a profound example of loyalty.

Orpah tearfully agrees, but &#8220;Ruth clung to her&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-14.htm">Ruth 1:14</a>). In that grasp Naomi feels the heartbeat of covenant loyalty&#8212;a loyalty Scripture later celebrates as chesed (<a href="/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>). In a world where everyone &#8220;did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), Ruth&#8217;s response shines. Similar devotion is seen when Jonathan &#8220;made a covenant with David&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>) and when Peter says, &#8220;Lord, to whom would we go?&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not urge me to leave you or to turn from following you</b><p>Ruth gently yet firmly asks Naomi to stop pressing her to depart.<p>&#8226; Steadfastness: Like Elisha who tells Elijah, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives&#8230; I will not leave you&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/2-2.htm">2 Kings 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal to quit: Parallels God&#8217;s promise, &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Counter-cultural choice: In contrast to Orpah&#8217;s reasonable decision, Ruth&#8217;s pledge is sacrificial, echoing Jesus&#8217; call to deny self and follow Him (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For wherever you go, I will go</b><p>Ruth commits to Naomi&#8217;s path, not knowing where it leads.<p>&#8226; Unconditional following: Like Abram who &#8220;went, as the LORD had told him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Sharing risk and hardship: Paul traveled with danger-willing companions such as Timothy (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The faith walk: Believers &#8220;walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And wherever you live, I will live</b><p>She will settle in a foreign land with foreign customs.<p>&#8226; New address, same commitment: Similar to Israel settling in Canaan yet clinging to God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing place for the sake of grace: Jeremiah urged exiles, &#8220;Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Gospel shadow: Jesus &#8220;became flesh and made His dwelling among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), identifying with us in our neighborhood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your people will be my people</b><p>Ruth pledges allegiance to Naomi&#8217;s community.<p>&#8226; Adoption language: Believers are &#8220;no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Costly identification: Moses chose &#8220;to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasure of sin&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-25.htm">Hebrews 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Breaking ethnic barriers: Foreshadows Gentile inclusion&#8212;&#8220;Once you were not a people, but now you are God&#8217;s people&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And your God will be my God</b><p>Here lies the heart of the vow: a clear, personal confession of faith.<p>&#8226; Conversion: Like the Thessalonians who &#8220;turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Exclusive devotion: Echoes Israel&#8217;s creed&#8212;&#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s challenge, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Redemption plan unfolding: This Moabite woman becomes great-grandmother to King David (<a href="/ruth/4-17.htm">Ruth 4:17</a>) and enters Messiah&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a> paints a portrait of covenant love that mirrors God&#8217;s own steadfast loyalty.

Ruth claims, as it were, Naomi's people and Naomi's God as her own already. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Ruth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7327.htm">Strong's 7327: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruth -- 'friendship', a Moabite ancestress of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
