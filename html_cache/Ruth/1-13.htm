In the ancient Near Eastern culture, the practice of levirate marriage was common, where a brother of a deceased man was obliged to marry his brother's widow to preserve the family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). Naomi is highlighting the impracticality of this option, as she has no other sons and is too old to bear more. This rhetorical question underscores the hopelessness of their situation and the improbability of waiting for new sons to grow up.<p><b>Would you refrain from having husbands?</b><br>Naomi is emphasizing the sacrifice that Orpah and Ruth would have to make if they chose to stay with her. In the cultural context, marriage and bearing children were vital for a woman's security and social standing. Naomi is urging them to consider their futures and the possibility of finding new husbands in their homeland, Moab. This reflects the societal norms and expectations for women at the time, where remaining unmarried was often seen as undesirable.<p><b>No, my daughters, it is much more bitter for me than for you,</b><br>Naomi expresses her deep personal grief and sense of loss. The term "bitter" reflects her emotional state, which is later echoed in her request to be called "Mara" (meaning "bitter") upon her return to Bethlehem (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>). Naomi's statement also highlights her selflessness, as she prioritizes the well-being of her daughters-in-law over her own. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the redemption and restoration that will come later in the narrative, as bitterness is turned to joy.<p><b>because the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.&#8221;</b><br>Naomi attributes her misfortunes to divine intervention, a common belief in the Old Testament where God's sovereignty is acknowledged in both blessings and trials (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). This reflects the theological understanding of the time, where personal and national events were often seen as directly influenced by God's will. Naomi's lament can be compared to the laments found in the Psalms, where the psalmists often express their distress and seek God's intervention (Psalm 13, <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>). This acknowledgment of God's hand sets the stage for the unfolding of His providential plan through Ruth, who becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Ruth, Naomi is a widow who has lost her husband and two sons.

Naomi invites them to pursue that path rather than cling to a future she cannot give.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, my daughters</b><p>&#8226; Her firm &#8220;No&#8221; shows both maternal tenderness and spiritual integrity. Like Eli saying, &#8220;No, my sons&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-24.htm">1 Samuel 2:24</a>), Naomi corrects with affection, not harshness.<p>&#8226; The repetition of &#8220;my daughters&#8221; (vv. 8, 11, 12, 13) underlines covenant family bonds transcending ethnicity (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-19</a>). Naomi&#8217;s faith shapes her language of belonging even in loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is much more bitter for me than for you</b><p>&#8226; Naomi shifts the spotlight from their grief to her compounded sorrow&#8212;husband gone, both sons dead, and no line to carry the family name (<a href="/ruth/1-3.htm">Ruth 1:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Her &#8220;bitter&#8221; (same root as &#8220;Mara,&#8221; v. 20) reflects Job&#8217;s lament (<a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) yet still speaks to God, not against Him. Honest lament is welcomed in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the hand of the LORD has gone out against me</b><p>&#8226; Naomi recognizes divine sovereignty. The phrase recalls <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a> and <a href="/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15</a>, where the &#8220;hand of the LORD&#8221; executes discipline or deliverance.<p>&#8226; Though she feels discipline, Naomi does not renounce faith; she attributes her circumstances to God&#8217;s active rule (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; This admission prepares the narrative&#8217;s turning point: the same hand that seems against her will soon be seen orchestrating redemption (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>; 4:14-17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Naomi&#8217;s triple appeal unmasks the futility of her daughters-in-law waiting for nonexistent sons, highlights the wisdom of remarriage, and reveals her own deep sorrow under God&#8217;s sovereign hand. Her candid, faith-filled lament sets the stage for Ruth&#8217;s loyal choice and for the Lord to turn bitterness into blessing, proving that even perceived divine opposition can become the pathway to covenant redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">It grieveth me much for your sakes.</span>--A much more probable translation is, <span class= "ital">it is far more bitter for me than for you. </span>An exact parallel to the construction is found in <a href="/genesis/19-9.htm" title="And they said, Stand back.
