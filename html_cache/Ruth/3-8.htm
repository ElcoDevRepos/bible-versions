This time is often associated with significant events in the Bible, such as the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>). The timing here underscores the unexpected nature of the encounter and the divine orchestration behind the events.<p><b>Boaz was startled</b><br>Boaz's reaction indicates surprise, suggesting that he was not expecting anyone to be at the threshing floor. The threshing floor was a place of work and not typically a place for visitors at night. His surprise also highlights the unusual nature of Ruth's actions, which were bold and culturally significant.<p><b>turned over</b><br>This phrase suggests a physical movement that indicates Boaz's alertness and readiness to address the situation. It reflects his character as a man of action and responsibility, traits that are consistent with his role as a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>).<p><b>and there lying at his feet</b><br>Ruth's position at Boaz's feet is symbolic of humility and submission. In the cultural context, this act was a non-verbal request for protection and redemption, aligning with the practice of a widow seeking a kinsman-redeemer. This act foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate Redeemer.<p><b>was a woman!</b><br>The presence of a woman at the threshing floor at night was highly unusual and could be misinterpreted. However, Ruth's intentions were pure, and her actions were guided by Naomi's instructions. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Boaz's role as a redeemer, paralleling Christ's redemptive work for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem.

Compare <a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>, where &#8220;at midnight the LORD struck down every firstborn in Egypt,&#8221; and <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>, where Paul and Silas worship &#8220;about midnight&#8221; before God opens the prison doors.<p>&#8226; Midnight underscores God&#8217;s perfect timing. Naomi planned Ruth&#8217;s approach for just this hour, trusting the Lord to direct Boaz&#8217;s heart (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Darkness heightens suspense yet also highlights God&#8217;s watchful care (<a href="/psalms/119-62.htm">Psalm 119:62</a>). Though unseen by others, He is fully present and active.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Boaz was startled</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Boaz was startled&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Hebrew idea is that he trembled awake&#8212;an involuntary, immediate reaction.

His surprise shows no prior expectation of impropriety; his conscience is clear (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Like David sneaking into Saul&#8217;s camp while a &#8220;deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/26-12.htm">1 Samuel 26:12</a>), Ruth&#8217;s presence is permitted by God, not discovered by servants, ensuring the meeting remains private and untainted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>turned over</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;turned over&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Boaz shifts position to investigate. It is a small, ordinary movement that becomes the hinge of God&#8217;s providence&#8212;much like when Moses &#8220;turned aside&#8221; to see the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The action signals readiness: Boaz moves from rest to responsible engagement, a pattern echoed in Jesus&#8217; parable, &#8220;When the master of that servant will come&#8230; at midnight or at daybreak&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-38.htm">Luke 12:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Our decisions in unexpected moments reveal character. Boaz&#8217;s next steps will confirm his role as kinsman-redeemer (<a href="/ruth/3-12.htm">Ruth 3:12-13</a>), foreshadowing Christ our Redeemer (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there lying at his feet was a woman!</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and there lying at his feet was a woman!&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ruth positions herself at Boaz&#8217;s feet, the ancient posture of humble appeal for protection. <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a> pictures the Lord spreading His garment over Israel; Ruth seeks the same covering (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Feet symbolize authority and refuge (<a href="/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>). Ruth&#8217;s act is modest, not seductive, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a> on levirate duty.<p>&#8226; Boaz will later bless her for greater kindness now than earlier (<a href="/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>), confirming her motives are righteous. God honors such purity, weaving Ruth into the lineage of David and ultimately Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; What began in the dark becomes public blessing by morning (<a href="/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14-18</a>), illustrating <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>: &#8220;Humble yourselves&#8230; that He may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/3-8.htm">Ruth 3:8</a> captures a divinely scripted turning point. At the precise midnight hour, God rouses Boaz, guiding his movement and revealing Ruth at his feet. Her respectful plea and his honorable response set the stage for redemption, marriage, and the unfolding of Messiah&#8217;s lineage. Even in the quiet darkness, God&#8217;s providence shines brightly, assuring us that He orchestrates every detail for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Was afraid.</span>--Was startled.

What could it be? In a moment or two he recovered his self-possession, and bending himself up and over, or "crooking himself, to see and to feel, lo, a woman was lying at his feet. The Chaldee Targumist tumbles into a ludicrous bathos of taste when endeavoring to emphasize the startle and shiver which Boas experienced. He says, "He trembled, <span class="accented">and his flesh</span>, <span class="accented">became soft as a turnip</span> from the agitation. How could the most peddling and paltering of Rabbis succeed in betraying himself into such a laughable puerility and absurdity? The explanation, though of course it is not the least atom of justification, lies in the fact that the Chaldee word for "turnip" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> while the verb that de notes "he bent himself" is the niphal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The use of the expression "<span class="accented">the</span> man," in this and several of the adjoining verses, is apt to grate a little upon English ears. Let us explain and vindicate the term as we may, the grating is still felt. No matter though we know that "<span class="accented">the</span> rank is but the guinea stamp," the grating is felt inevitably. It is a result of that peculiar growth in living language that splits generic terms into such as are specific or semi-specific. We have <span class="accented">gentleman</span> as well as <span class="accented">man</span>, and embarrassment is not infrequently the result of our linguistic wealth.
