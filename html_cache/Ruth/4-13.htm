The marriage of Boaz and Ruth is significant as it unites a Moabite woman with an Israelite man, demonstrating God's inclusive plan for all nations. This union also reflects the Levirate marriage custom, where a close relative marries a widow to preserve the family lineage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). Boaz's actions are a type of Christ, who redeems His bride, the Church. The marriage takes place in Bethlehem, a town that later becomes significant as the birthplace of Jesus Christ.<p><b>And when he had relations with her,</b><br>This phrase indicates the consummation of the marriage, which was necessary for the continuation of the family line. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, producing offspring was vital for inheritance and maintaining the family name. The physical union between Boaz and Ruth is a fulfillment of God's design for marriage, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man and woman become one flesh.<p><b>the LORD enabled her to conceive,</b><br>This highlights God's sovereignty and active role in the conception of new life. Ruth's ability to conceive is portrayed as a divine blessing, emphasizing that children are a gift from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). The mention of the LORD's involvement underscores the theme of divine providence throughout the book of Ruth. It also connects to other biblical narratives where God intervenes in the conception of significant figures, such as Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>).<p><b>and she gave birth to a son.</b><br>The birth of a son is significant for several reasons. It ensures the continuation of Elimelech's family line and provides security for Naomi, who had lost her husband and sons. This son, Obed, becomes the grandfather of King David, placing Ruth and Boaz in the direct lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>). The birth of Obed is a fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), and it foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, who would be a descendant of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy landowner in Bethlehem, a kinsman-redeemer for Ruth, and a man of noble character who marries Ruth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who shows loyalty to her mother-in-law Naomi and becomes the great-grandmother of King David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people, enabling Ruth to conceive.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The town where the events take place, significant as the birthplace of King David and later Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/conception_and_birth.htm">Conception and Birth</a></b><br>The miraculous provision of a son, Obed, who becomes part of the lineage of David and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_family.htm">God's Sovereignty in Family</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the formation of families and the continuation of His covenant promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_and_reward.htm">Faithfulness and Reward</a></b><br>Ruth's faithfulness to Naomi and God is rewarded with a place in the lineage of the Messiah, demonstrating that God honors loyalty and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_and_restoration.htm">Redemption and Restoration</a></b><br>Boaz as a kinsman-redeemer is a type of Christ, who redeems and restores us, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>The events in Ruth's life show God's providential care and orchestration of events for His purposes, encouraging trust in His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faith.htm">Legacy of Faith</a></b><br>Ruth's account encourages believers to consider the impact of their faith and actions on future generations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ruth_4_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ruth 4:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ruth_4_13_God_s_providence_shown.htm">How does Ruth 4:13 demonstrate God's providence in Ruth's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_marriage_in_God_s_plan_Ruth_4_13.htm">What role does marriage play in God's plan according to Ruth 4:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ruth_4_13_and_God_s_covenant_link.htm">How does Ruth 4:13 connect to God's covenant promises in Genesis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_s_timing_like_Ruth.htm">How can we trust God's timing in our lives like Ruth did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faithfulness_from_Ruth_4_13.htm">What lessons on faithfulness can we learn from Ruth's story in Ruth 4:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ruth_4_13_God_s_role_in_relationships.htm">How does Ruth 4:13 illustrate God's providence in personal relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/God_s_role_in_marriage_in_Ruth_4_13.htm">What does Ruth 4:13 reveal about God's role in marriage and family?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ruth_4_13_to_David_Jesus_lineage.htm">How does Ruth 4:13 connect to the lineage of King David and Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ruth_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ruth 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_akeldama's_significance.htm">Who was Boaz in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_ruth_teach_about_loyalty,_faith.htm">What lessons does Ruth's story teach about loyalty and faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_family_planning.htm">What does the Bible say about family planning?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what's_bethlehem's_biblical_role.htm">What is Bethlehem's biblical significance?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ruth 4:13 Mean</div><b>So Boaz took Ruth</b><p>&#8220;So Boaz took Ruth&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;
