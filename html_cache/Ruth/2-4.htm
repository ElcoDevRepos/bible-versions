Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is a town in Judah known for its fertile land. This setting foreshadows its future significance as the birthplace of Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Boaz, a wealthy and influential man, is introduced as a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), which allowed a relative to redeem a family member in distress.<p><b>and said to the harvesters,</b><br>Boaz's interaction with his workers reflects the agrarian culture of ancient Israel, where landowners and laborers worked closely during harvest. The harvesters were likely gleaning barley, a staple crop, indicating the time of year was spring. This setting provides a backdrop for the unfolding of God's providence in Ruth's life.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD be with you.&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's greeting reveals his piety and the integration of faith into daily life. This blessing invokes the presence of Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing the spiritual atmosphere in which Boaz operates. It reflects the theocratic society of Israel, where God's presence was central to community life (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>).<p><b>&#8220;The LORD bless you,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>The reciprocal blessing from the harvesters indicates mutual respect and a shared faith. This exchange underscores the godly character of Boaz's household and the positive relationship between him and his workers. It also reflects the cultural norm of invoking God's favor in everyday interactions, as seen in other scriptural greetings (<a href="/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/23-21.htm">1 Samuel 23:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.
