It symbolized a transition from one state to another, often from mourning to joy or from impurity to purity. In the context of Ruth, washing herself signifies her readiness to move from widowhood to a new phase of life. This act can be seen as a parallel to the spiritual cleansing that believers undergo, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>.<p><b>Put on perfume</b><br>Perfume in biblical times was often made from oils and spices, used to anoint and refresh. The use of perfume by Ruth indicates her intention to present herself favorably to Boaz, aligning with cultural practices of enhancing one's presence. This act can be seen as a preparation for a significant encounter, much like Esther's preparation before meeting King Xerxes (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>).<p><b>And wear your best clothes</b><br>The instruction to wear her best clothes suggests a change from mourning attire to garments suitable for a festive or significant occasion. This change of clothing symbolizes a new beginning and hope for redemption. In biblical typology, clothing often represents righteousness or a new identity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>.<p><b>Go down to the threshing floor</b><br>The threshing floor was a place where grain was separated from chaff, often located outside the city. It was a place of labor and celebration during the harvest. Ruth's journey to the threshing floor signifies her willingness to step into a new role and seek provision and protection. The threshing floor is also a place of divine encounters, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>.<p><b>But do not let the man know you are there</b><br>This instruction highlights the cultural norms of discretion and propriety. Ruth's approach to Boaz needed to be respectful and in line with the customs of the time. It reflects the wisdom of timing and the importance of approaching situations with humility and patience, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>.<p><b>Until he has finished eating and drinking</b><br>Waiting until Boaz had finished eating and drinking ensured that he was in a good mood and more receptive to Ruth's request. This reflects the cultural understanding of hospitality and the significance of timing in making requests. It also underscores the importance of wisdom and discernment in interactions, as advised in <a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and to the God of Israel.

Ruth obeys Naomi, honors Boaz, and trusts the LORD, demonstrating that readiness, modest initiative, and patience position God&#8217;s people to receive His redemptive blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3-5) The plan suggested by Naomi seems peculiar, yet some thoughts may give a certain colouring to it. (1) Naomi seems <span class= "ital">to </span>have believed that Boaz was the nearest kinsman, being ignorant of the yet nearer one (<a href="/ruth/3-12.htm" title="And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.">Ruth 3:12</a>). Consequently, according to Israelite law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>it would be the duty of Boaz to marry Ruth to raise up seed to the dead. (2) The general tone of Naomi's character is clearly shown in this book to be that of a God-fearing woman, so that it is certain that, however curious in its external form, there can be nothing counselled here which really is repugnant to God's law, or shocking to a virtuous man such as Boaz, otherwise Naomi would simply have been most completely frustrating her own purpose. (3) Her knowledge by long intimacy of Ruth's character, and doubtless also of that of Boaz by report, would enable her to feel sure that no ill effects could accrue.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So then wash thyself, and anoint thyself, and dress thyself?</span> This latter phrase is in the original, "and put thy garments on thee." The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;</span> with its final yod, was the archaic form of the second person feminine, though still much cut down and contracted from its oldest form. See Raabe's 'Zuruckfuhring,' and note the conduct of the verb, in its relation to the pronominal suffixes, when these are affixed. <span class="cmt_word">And go down to the threshing-floor.</span> The town of Bethlehem lay on the summit of "the narrow ridge of a long gray hill" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 163), while the corn-fields, that gave the fortified place its name of <span class="accented">Bread-town</span>, stretched out expandingly in the valleys below. Dr. Robinson says, "We ascended gradually toward Bethlehem around the broad head of a valley running N.E. to join that under Mar Elyas The town lies on the E. and N.E. slope of a long ridge; another deep valley, Wady Ta'amirah, being on the south side, which passes down north of the Frank Mountain toward the Dead Sea, receiving the valley under Mar Elyas not far below. Toward the west the hill is higher than the village, and then sinks down very gradually toward Wady Ahmed ('Biblical Researches,' vol. 2. p. 158). <span class="cmt_word">Let not your presence be known to the man before he has finished eating and drinking.</span> It would have been imprudent and impolite to have discovered her presence while his servants and himself were busied in operations which required to be actively prosecuted while the breeze was favorable, and the light of the moon serviceable. Ruth was to wait till the servants, having finished their work and their repast, had retired to their respective homes. The master, as Naomi knew, would remain gratefully and joyfully on the spot, to keep watch in the midst of his cereal treasures, and under the still magnificence of the broad canopy of heaven. Speaking of Hebron, Dr. Robinson says, "Here we needed no guard around our tent. The owners of the crops came every night and slept upon their threshing-floors to guard them, and this we had found to be universal in all the region of Gaza. We were in the midst of scenes precisely like those of the Book of Ruth, when Boaz winnowed barley in his threshing-floor, and laid himself down at night to guard the heap of corn" ('Biblical Researches, ' vol. 2. p. 446). Boaz's heart, when all was quiet around him, would be full of calm and comfort. He would pace about his well-heaped threshing-floor contentedly, contemplatively; and, as he paced, and thought, and adored, the figure of the beautiful and industrious gleaner might persist in coming in within the field of meditation. It might linger there, and be gladly allowed to linger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore wash yourself,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;
