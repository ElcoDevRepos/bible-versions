This law allowed the needy to gather leftover crops, demonstrating God's care for the marginalized. Ruth, a Moabite, exemplifies humility and diligence, qualities that are honored throughout Scripture. Her willingness to work hard for her sustenance is a testament to her character and faithfulness.<p><b>Boaz ordered his young men</b><br>Boaz, a man of standing in Bethlehem, exercises his authority with compassion and integrity. His instructions to his workers reveal his protective nature and adherence to the law, which commands kindness to strangers and the poor. Boaz's actions foreshadow the protective and redemptive nature of Christ, who cares for and defends His people. This moment also highlights the social structure of ancient Israel, where landowners had significant influence over their workers.<p><b>&#8220;Even if she gathers among the sheaves</b><br>Allowing Ruth to gather among the sheaves goes beyond the typical gleaning rights, showing Boaz's generosity and grace. This act of kindness is a precursor to the redemption theme that runs throughout the book. It also reflects the abundant provision of God, who often gives more than we ask or imagine, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>. Boaz's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides abundantly for His followers.<p><b>do not insult her.</b><br>Boaz's command to his workers to treat Ruth with respect underscores the biblical principle of treating others with dignity, regardless of their social status or background. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and respect for all people. The cultural context of the time often left women and foreigners vulnerable to mistreatment, making Boaz's directive a significant act of protection and honor. This mirrors the New Testament call to love one's neighbor as oneself, as found in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by returning with her to Bethlehem.

Ruth, a Moabite widow, takes hold of that promise with humble industry.<p>&#8226; Her rising &#8220;to glean&#8221; shows diligence much like the woman praised in <a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13-17</a>, who &#8220;rises while it is still night and provides food for her household.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God often meets needs through faithful effort rather than passivity (compare <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Boaz ordered his young men</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Boaz ordered his young men&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Boaz, the landowner, actively oversees the welfare of those in his field. His leadership echoes <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, where the Lord &#8220;commands His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By intervening, Boaz models godly responsibility (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) and anticipates the Good Shepherd motif later fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; His order also sets a tone of kindness in the workplace, a principle reinforced in <a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Masters, grant your slaves what is right and fair.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even if she gathers among the sheaves</b><p>&#8220;Even if she gathers among the sheaves&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Normally gleaners stayed on the field edges; the sheaves belonged to the reapers. Boaz extends Ruth&#8217;s privilege to the very heart of the harvest.<p>&#8226; This generous permission reflects <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, where God promises blessing to those who leave bundles for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates God&#8217;s abundance toward those who trust Him&#8212;&#8220;God is able to make every grace overflow to you&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>) and &#8220;far beyond all we ask or imagine&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not insult her</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;do not insult her.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Boaz guards Ruth&#8217;s dignity, refusing to allow teasing, shaming, or harassment. <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His command anticipates <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>, which forbids showing favoritism or dishonoring the poor.<p>&#8226; Respect for every image-bearer remains a hallmark of covenant living; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a> calls believers to &#8220;clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/2-15.htm">Ruth 2:15</a> paints a picture of divine provision and human kindness working together. Ruth steps out in faith to glean; Boaz exercises protective authority; extraordinary grace allows her into the sheaves; firm instruction shields her from insult. The verse underscores God&#8217;s heart for the vulnerable and invites His people to mirror that heart with generous, respectful action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she rose to glean: and Boaz charged his young men, saying, Even between the sheaves let her glean, and do not affront her.</span> Boaz would probably thus speak in the hearing of Ruth herself, so that, without any fear of reproach, she might feel free to take full advantage of the privilege accorded her. Boaz wished her to gather a large gleaning, no doubt rightly conjecturing that there must have been for some time past but little superfluity in the larder of Naomi. The space "between the sheaves," as distinguished from the spaces outside their line, would probably be the part whither the maidens conveyed their collected armfuls, and where they bound them into sheaves. It would thus be the place where there would be the greatest number of 'waifs.' It would also be the place in which unprincipled gleaners might have the best opportunity for stealing from the sheaves. Boaz felt unbounded confidence in Ruth, and said to the reapers, "Affront her not," namely, by saying or insinuating anything to the effect that she was either pilfering, on the one hand, or making herself too forward, on the other. The Vulgate version completely merges out of sight the poetic beauty and tenderness of the injunction by rendering it thus: "Do not hinder her." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When [Ruth] got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
