Her inquiry reflects her concern and care for Ruth, who has shown loyalty by staying with Naomi after the death of her husband and sons. Naomi's question also indicates the importance of gleaning for their survival, as they were widows without a male provider.<p><b>&#8220;Where did you glean today, and where did you work?</b><br>Gleaning was a practice commanded in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, allowing the poor and foreigners to gather leftover crops from the fields. This reflects God's provision for the marginalized. Ruth's gleaning in the fields of Bethlehem, a town in Judah, places her in the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus Christ, as Bethlehem is also the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><b>Blessed be the man who noticed you.&#8221;</b><br>Naomi's blessing upon the man who showed kindness to Ruth highlights the cultural importance of hospitality and generosity. In the context of the narrative, Boaz's favor towards Ruth is seen as providential, aligning with God's overarching plan. This blessing foreshadows the role Boaz will play as a kinsman-redeemer, a type of Christ who redeems and restores.<p><b>So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked.</b><br>Ruth's report to Naomi signifies transparency and trust in their relationship. It also sets the stage for Naomi to recognize the providential hand of God in leading Ruth to Boaz's field, which will become a pivotal moment in their story of redemption.<p><b>&#8220;The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,&#8221; she said.</b><br>The introduction of Boaz is crucial, as he is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech. This connection introduces the concept of the kinsman-redeemer, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. Boaz's role as a redeemer prefigures Christ, who redeems humanity.

"Where hast thou gleaned today? and where hash thou worked?" She saw at a glance, from the magnitude of the load, from the bright and beaming countenance of her daughter-in-law, and from the delicious parched corn which the master had given with his own hands, that the day had been crowned with peculiar blessings. The lines had fallen in pleasant places. Hence her womanly and motherly interest to get full particulars. Ruth, on her part, would feel as if a kind of inspiration had seized upon her tongue. <span class="cmt_word">And she showed to her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and she said, The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.
