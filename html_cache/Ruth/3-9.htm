The setting is the threshing floor, a place where grain was processed, and it was not uncommon for landowners to sleep there to protect their harvest. The question reflects the darkness and uncertainty of the moment, as well as Boaz's initial lack of recognition of Ruth. This moment is significant in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Ruth's bold request.<p><b>&#8220;I am your servant Ruth,&#8221; she replied.</b><br>Ruth identifies herself humbly as a servant, which is consistent with her character throughout the book. Her humility is notable, especially given her Moabite background, which would have made her an outsider in Israel. This self-identification also reflects her willingness to submit to Boaz's authority and protection, aligning with the cultural norms of the time where women often sought security through marriage or kinship ties.<p><b>&#8220;Spread the corner of your garment over me,</b><br>This phrase is a culturally loaded request for protection and provision. In ancient Near Eastern customs, spreading one's garment over another symbolized a pledge of marriage or a commitment to protect. The act is akin to a marriage proposal, where Ruth is asking Boaz to take her under his care as a husband would. This request also echoes the imagery of God's protection over Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>, where God spreads His garment over Jerusalem as a sign of covenantal relationship.<p><b>for you are a kinsman-redeemer.&#8221;</b><br>The term "kinsman-redeemer" (Hebrew: go'el) is central to the narrative. It refers to a close relative who has the responsibility to redeem a family member in distress, whether by buying back land, marrying a widow to preserve the family line, or avenging blood. This concept is rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a>) and is a picture of God's redemption. Boaz, as a kinsman-redeemer, is a type of Christ, who redeems humanity. The role of the kinsman-redeemer foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus, who takes on the responsibility to restore and protect His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem.

And she said, I am Ruth, thy handmaid; and thou hast spread thy wings over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman.</span> The Syriac translator spoils the question of Boaz by metamorphosing it from "<span class="accented">Who</span> art thou?" into "<span class="accented">What</span> is thy message?" Tremulous would be the voice of Ruth as she replied, "I am Ruth, thy handmaid." What she said in continuance has been very generally, and by Driver, among others ('Hebrew Tenses,' p. 135), misapprehended. Not by Raabe, however. It has been regarded as a petition presented to Boaz - "Spread thy wings (or, <span class="accented">thy wing</span>) over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman." The literal translation, however, and far the more delicate idea, as also far the more effective representation, is, "And thou hast spread thy wings over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman." Ruth explains her position under Boaz's coverlet as if it were his own deliberate act. Such is her felicitous way of putting the case. It is as if she had said, "The position in which thy handmaid actually is exhibits the true relation in which thou standest to thy handmaid. She is under thy wings. Thou hast benignantly spread them over her, for thou art kinsman." The Masorites have correctly regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e0;&#x5e4;</span> as a <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span> for the dual of the noun, and hence have punctuated it <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, "thy wings." The majority of interpreters, however, have assumed that the word is singular, and have hence translated it as if it had been punctuated <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>. The dual reading is to be preferred. Boaz himself had represented Ruth as having come trustfully under the wings of Yahveh (see <a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>). She accepted the representation. It was beautifully true. But, as she was well aware that God often works through human agency, she now recognized the Divine hand in the kindness of Boaz. "<span class="accented">Thou hast spread thy wings</span> over thine handmaid." She was under his wings because she had come under the wings of Yahveh. She felt like a little timid chicken; but she had found a refuge. It is the wings of tender, gentle, sheltering care that are referred to. There is only indirect allusion to the typical coverlet under which she lay. <span class="cmt_word">For thou art kinsman</span> (see <a href="/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>). The native modesty of Ruth led her to account for her position by a reference to the law of kinship. She had rights, and she stood upon them. She conceived that Boaz had correlative duties to discharge; but we may be sure that she would never have made the least reference to her rights, or to the correlative duties which she regarded as devolving on Boaz, had she not known that his heart was already hers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are you?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1514;&#1468;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;t)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
