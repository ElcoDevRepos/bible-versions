The Moabites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). Her presence in Bethlehem underscores themes of inclusion and God's grace extending beyond Israel. Ruth's loyalty to Naomi, despite cultural and national differences, exemplifies devotion and love.<p><b>Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain</b><br>Gleaning was a provision in the Mosaic Law for the poor, widows, and foreigners (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-22</a>). It allowed them to gather leftover crops after the harvesters. Ruth's request shows her willingness to work hard and her humility in accepting her status. This act of gleaning foreshadows God's providence and care for those who trust in Him.<p><b>after someone in whose sight I may find favor</b><br>Ruth seeks favor, indicating her hope for kindness and protection. This reflects the biblical principle of finding favor in the eyes of others, often seen as a sign of God's blessing (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>, <a href="/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>). Her faith and initiative set the stage for divine intervention and blessing through Boaz, a type of Christ as a redeemer.<p><b>Go ahead, my daughter, Naomi replied</b><br>Naomi's response shows her approval and affection for Ruth, calling her "my daughter," which signifies a close relationship. This moment marks a turning point from despair to hope, as Naomi begins to see the potential for God's provision through Ruth's actions. Naomi's trust in Ruth's judgment also reflects her own faith in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who shows loyalty and devotion to her mother-in-law, Naomi.

Naomi blesses her venture, and together they demonstrate how ordinary obedience opens the door for extraordinary grace&#8212;setting the stage for Boaz&#8217;s redemption and, ultimately, for Messiah&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) Let me now go.--The character of Ruth comes out strongly here. She does not hesitate to face the hard work necessary on her mother-in-law's account; nor is she too proud to condescend to a work which might perhaps seem humiliating. Nor does one hanker after her old home in the land of Moab and the plenty there. Energy, honesty of purpose, and loyalty are alike evinced here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me go, I pray thee, to the cornfields, that I may glean among the ears after whosoever shall show me favor.</span> In modern style one would not, in referring, at this stage of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree necessary or advantageous to repeat the designation "the Moabitess." The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-22.htm">Leviticus 23:22</a>: <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. "<span class="accented">Let</span> me go I, pray, thee;" or, "<span class="accented">I</span> wish to go, if you will please to allow me." Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom. "<span class="accented">There is</span> no place," says Lawson, "where our tongues ought to be better governed than in our own houses." <span class="cmt_word">To the cornfields.</span> Very literally, "<span class="accented">to</span> the field." It is the language of townspeople, when referring to the land round about the town that was kept under tillage. It was not customary to separate cornfield from cornfield by means of walls and hedges. A simple furrow, with perhaps a stone here and there, or a small collection of stones, sufficed, as in Switzerland at the present day, to distinguish the patches or portions that belonged to different proprietors. Hence the singular word <span class="accented">field</span>, as comprehending the sum-total of the adjoining unenclosed ground that had been laid down in grain. "Though the gardens and vineyards," says Horatio B. Hackett, "are usually surrounded by a stone wall or hedge of prickly pear, the grain-fields, on the contrary, though they belong to different proprietors, are not separated by any enclosure from each other. The boundary between them is indicated by heaps of small stones, or sometimes by single upright stones, placed at intervals of a rod or more from each other. This is the ancient landmark of which we read in the Old Testament" ('Illustrations of Scripture,' p. 110). The <span class="accented">word field in</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, denotes radically, not so much <span class="accented">plain</span>, as <span class="accented">ploughed</span> land (see Raabe's 'Glosser'). In English there is a slightly varied though corresponding idiom lying at the base of the Teutonic term in use. A <span class="accented">field</span> (German <span class="accented">Fold</span>) is a <span class="accented">clearance</span>, a place where the trees of the original forest have been <span class="accented">felled</span>. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">that I may glean 'among' the ears,</span> proceeds on the assumption that Ruth did not expect that she would "make a clean sweep" of all the straggled ears. There might likely be other gleaners besides herself, and even though there should not, she could not expect to gather all. <span class="cmt_word">After whosoever shall show me favor.</span> A peculiarly antique kind of structure in the original: "after whom I shall find favor in his eyes." Ruth speaks as if she thought only of one reaper, and he the proprietor. She, as it were, instinctively conceives of the laborers as "hands." <span class="cmt_word">And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</span> Naomi yielded; no doubt at first reluctantly, yet no doubt also in a spirit of grateful admiration of her daughter-in-law, who, when she could hot lift up her circumstances to her mind, brought down her mind to her circumstances <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Ruth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7327.htm">Strong's 7327: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruth -- 'friendship', a Moabite ancestress of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Moabitess</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
