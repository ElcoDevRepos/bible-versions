It reflects the cultural norm of sharing news and developments with family members, especially in matters of provision and protection.<p><b>&#8220;He gave me these six measures of barley,</b><br>The six measures of barley symbolize Boaz's generosity and his role as a provider. In the ancient Near Eastern context, barley was a staple grain, and this gift signifies abundance and care. The number six, often associated with incompleteness in biblical numerology, may suggest that Boaz's actions are part of a larger, unfolding plan. This act of giving also prefigures Christ's provision for His people, as Boaz is a type of Christ, the kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>for he said,</b><br>This phrase indicates Boaz's intentionality and thoughtfulness. His words carry authority and purpose, reflecting his character as a man of integrity and foresight. It underscores the importance of spoken promises and the weight they carry in biblical narratives.<p><b>&#8216;Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's instruction to Ruth not to return empty-handed highlights his understanding of Naomi's situation and his desire to bless her. This reflects the cultural value placed on family loyalty and support. The term "empty-handed" connects to Naomi's earlier lament in <a href="/ruth/1-21.htm">Ruth 1:21</a>, where she describes returning from Moab empty. Boaz's provision is a direct response to this, symbolizing God's restoration and blessing. This act foreshadows the ultimate redemption and fullness found in Christ, who fills the spiritual emptiness of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem to seek refuge and provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>Ruth's mother-in-law, who has returned to Bethlehem after the death of her husband and sons, and is seeking security for Ruth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy relative of Naomi's late husband, who is a kinsman-redeemer and has shown kindness and protection to Ruth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The town in Judah where Naomi and Ruth have returned, and where Boaz's fields are located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The place where Boaz was winnowing barley, and where Ruth approached him to seek his protection and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_provision.htm">Generosity and Provision</a></b><br>Boaz's actions demonstrate the importance of generosity and provision for those in need.
