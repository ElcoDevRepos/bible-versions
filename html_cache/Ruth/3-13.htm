Boaz's invitation for Ruth to stay was a gesture of protection and care, ensuring her safety from potential harm. This reflects the cultural norms of hospitality and protection for women, especially widows, who were vulnerable in society.<p><b>and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good. Let him redeem you.</b><br>The concept of redemption here refers to the Levirate marriage and the role of the kinsman-redeemer (goel), a practice outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. This law provided for a close relative to marry a widow to preserve the family line and property. Boaz acknowledges the presence of a closer relative who has the first right to redeem Ruth, demonstrating his integrity and adherence to the law.<p><b>But if he does not want to redeem you, as surely as the LORD lives, I will.</b><br>Boaz's oath "as surely as the LORD lives" underscores the seriousness and binding nature of his promise. This phrase is a common biblical expression used to affirm truthfulness and commitment (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>). Boaz's willingness to redeem Ruth if the closer relative declines highlights his role as a type of Christ, who redeems humanity out of love and commitment.<p><b>Now lie here until morning.</b><br>Boaz's instruction for Ruth to remain until morning was likely for her protection and to avoid any scandal or misunderstanding that might arise from her leaving in the middle of the night. This reflects the cultural importance of maintaining a woman's reputation and the care Boaz had for Ruth's well-being. It also signifies a period of waiting and trust in God's provision, paralleling the believer's trust in God's timing and plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy landowner in Bethlehem, Boaz is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.

Boaz's plan of operations would formulate itself on the spur of the moment; but the remainder of the night would doubtless be spent in maturing the details of procedure. The aim would be to secure, as far as honor would permit, the much-wished-for prize.
