In the context of ancient Israel, it was important to follow proper legal procedures, especially concerning land and family inheritance. The speaker, Boaz, is acting in accordance with the law of levirate marriage and redemption, which required informing the nearest kinsman of his right to redeem.<p><b>that you may buy it back</b><br>The concept of "buying back" refers to the redemption of property. According to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), if a relative became poor and sold some of their property, the nearest kinsman had the right to redeem it. This ensured that land remained within the family and tribe, preserving the inheritance given by God.<p><b>in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people</b><br>The presence of witnesses, particularly the elders, was crucial for validating legal transactions. Elders were respected leaders in the community who ensured that justice and tradition were upheld. This public setting provided transparency and accountability.<p><b>If you want to redeem it, do so</b><br>Boaz offers the kinsman the first right of redemption, adhering to the law. This reflects the importance of following God's commandments and respecting the established order. Redemption here is not just a legal act but also a moral and familial duty.<p><b>But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know</b><br>Boaz seeks clarity and decisiveness. This reflects the need for clear communication in legal matters. It also highlights Boaz's willingness to fulfill the role of redeemer if the nearer kinsman declines, showing his commitment to family and duty.<p><b>because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you</b><br>This statement underscores the order of redemption rights. The nearest kinsman had the first right, and if he declined, the next in line could redeem. This order ensured that the family line and property remained intact, reflecting God's provision for His people.<p><b>&#8220;I will redeem it,&#8221; he replied</b><br>The kinsman's initial willingness to redeem the land shows his understanding of his legal and familial obligations. However, as the narrative unfolds, his decision changes when he learns of the additional responsibility of marrying Ruth, which Boaz is prepared to undertake. This highlights Boaz's role as a type of Christ, willing to go beyond the law to show grace and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A prominent and wealthy man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.

By doing this publicly, he ensures transparency and faithfulness to God&#8217;s law (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>). He addresses the nearer kinsman, the man first in line to perform the duties of a &#8220;kinsman-redeemer&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/3-12.htm">Ruth 3:12</a>). The stage is set for a lawful transaction that will protect Naomi&#8217;s family line and property.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The legal framework</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law provided that a close relative could &#8220;redeem&#8221; (buy back) land a family had lost (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>).<p>&#8226; If a man died without children, his brother&#8212;or nearest relative&#8212;was to marry the widow to produce an heir, keeping the family name alive (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Both land redemption and levirate marriage converge here. Boaz carefully cites the land aspect first because it is simpler and more appealing. He speaks &#8220;in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people,&#8221; emphasizing public accountability (<a href="/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Boaz&#8217;s strategic approach</b><p>Boaz begins with the property, not with Ruth. He says, &#8220;If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4</a>). He honors the nearer kinsman&#8217;s right, but also presses for a clear decision. The phrase &#8220;there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you&#8221; underscores both urgency and propriety (compare <a href="/ruth/3-12.htm">Ruth 3:12-13</a>). Boaz is meticulous&#8212;he will not proceed unlawfully, yet he trusts God to work through the process.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The first redeemer&#8217;s response</b><p>The relative quickly answers, &#8220;I will redeem it&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4</a>). At this point he sees only a real-estate opportunity: more land, more crops, increased wealth. He has not yet considered the covenant responsibility of marrying Ruth, which would dilute his inheritance (<a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5-6</a>). This contrast between material gain and sacrificial love prepares the way for Boaz to shine as the true redeemer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Foreshadowing the greater Redeemer</b><p>&#8226; Boaz, willing to bear cost and risk, prefigures Christ, who &#8220;not with silver or gold, but with His precious blood&#8221; redeemed us (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The public nature of the transaction mirrors Christ&#8217;s open triumph on the cross (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The nearer kinsman represents the law, able to expose need but unwilling to pay the ultimate price (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>).

Boaz honors God&#8217;s statutes, gives the nearer kinsman his rightful choice, and sets the stage for sacrificial redemption. The verse highlights the tension between self-interest and covenant loyalty, ultimately pointing to Christ, who stepped in when no one else could or would, securing our eternal inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And I thought . . .</span>--literally, <span class= "ital">and I said I will uncover thy ear.</span><p><span class= "bld">The inhabitants.</span>--This should perhaps rather be, <span class= "ital">those who are sitting here </span>[the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">yashabh </span>has the two meanings of <span class= "ital">dwelling </span>and <span class= "ital">sitting, </span>see <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/genesis/23-10.htm" title="And Ephron dwelled among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,">Genesis 23:10</a>, where the latter meaning should certainly be taken].

It is a primitive phrase to denote internal resolution. There is a point where thought and speech coalesce. Our words are thoughts, and our thoughts are words. <span class="cmt_word">I will uncover thine ear,</span> that is, "I will lift the locks of hair that may be covering the ear, so as to communicate something in confidence." But here the phrase is employed with the specific import of secrecy dropt out. It is thus somewhat equivalent to "I will give thee notice;" only the following expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">to say,</span> must be read in the light of the undiluted original phrase, "<span class="accented">I</span> will uncover thine ear to say. The whole expression furnishes the most beautiful instance imaginable of the primary meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>. The thing that was to be said follows immediately, viz., <span class="cmt_word">Acquire it</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">Buy it.</span> It is as if he had said, "<span class="accented">Now</span> you have a chance which may not occur again." It is added, <span class="cmt_word">in the presence of the inhabitants.</span> This, rather than "the assessors," is the natural interpretation of the participle (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). It is the translation which the word generally receives in the very numerous instances in which it occurs. There was, so to speak, a fair representation of the inhabitants of the city in the casual company that had assembled in the gateway. And <span class="cmt_word">in presence of the elders of my people.</span> The natural "aldermen," or unofficial "senators," whose presence extemporized for the occasion a sufficient court of testators. <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt perform the part of a kinsman, perform it.</span> The translation in King James's English version, and in many other versions, viz., "If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it," is somewhat out of harmony with the nature of the case. Naomi was not wishing Elimelech's estate to be redeemed. It was not yet in a position to be redeemed. It had not been alienated or sold. She wished for it not a redeemer, but a purchaser. And as it was the <span class="accented">right</span> of a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> or kinsman to redeem for a reduced brother, if he was able and willing, the estate which had been sold to an alien (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), so it was the <span class="accented">privilege</span> of the same <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> or kinsman to get, if the reduced brother was wishing to sell, the first offer of the estate. It would, in particular, be at variance with the prerogative of the nearest of kin if some other one in the circle of the kindred, but not so near, were to be offered on sale the usufructuary possession of the family estate (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23, 27</a>). Hence Boaz recognized the prior prerogative of his anonymous relative and friend, and said to him, "If thou wilt perform the part of a kinsman, and buy the property, then buy it." It is added, <span class="cmt_word">and if he will not.</span> Note the use of the third person <span class="accented">he</span>, instead of the second <span class="accented">thou</span>. If the reading be correct, then Boaz, in thus speaking, must for the moment have turned to the witnesses so as to address them. That the reading is correct, notwithstanding that some MSS. and all the ancient versions exhibit the verb in the second person, is rendered probable by the very fact that <span class="accented">it is the difficult reading</span>. There could be no temptation for a transcriber to substitute the third person for the second; there would be temptation to substitute the second for the third. The unanimity of the ancient versions is probably attributable to the habit of neglecting absolute literality, and translating according to the sense, when the sense was clear. Boaz, turning back instantaneously to his relative, says, <span class="cmt_word">Make thou known to me, that I may know, for there is none besides thee to act the kinsman's part</span> <span class="cmt_word">(with the exception of myself), and I come after thee.</span> The little clause, "with the exception of myself," lies in the sense, or spirit, although not in the letter of Boaz's address, as reported in the text. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I will act the kinsman's part.</span> He was glad to get the opportunity of adding to his own patrimonial possession the property that had belonged to Elimelech, and which Naomi, in her reduced condition, wished to dispose cf. So far all seemed to go straight against the interests of Ruth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
