It was a place of agricultural activity where grain was separated from chaff, symbolizing separation and purification. In biblical narratives, the threshing floor can also represent a place of decision and divine encounter, as seen in the story of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>). Ruth's journey to the threshing floor signifies a pivotal moment in her life, where her future and the future of Naomi's family line are at stake.<p><b>and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do</b><br>Naomi's instructions to Ruth were culturally significant, reflecting the customs of levirate marriage and the role of a kinsman-redeemer. By following Naomi's guidance, Ruth demonstrates obedience and loyalty, qualities highly valued in biblical narratives. This act of obedience also prefigures the obedience of Christ, who followed the will of His Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>). Ruth's actions align with the cultural practices of the time, where a widow could seek protection and provision through a kinsman-redeemer, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. This moment foreshadows the redemption that Boaz, as a type of Christ, will provide for Ruth and Naomi, ultimately leading to the lineage of David and the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem.

And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was comfortable; and he went to lie down at the end of the heap; and she came softly, and uncovered the parts about his feet, and laid herself down.</span> The translation in King James's version, "and his heart was <span class="accented">merry</span>," is perhaps stronger than there is any occasion for. The word rendered "was <span class="accented">merry</span>," - viz., <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> - is literally "was <span class="accented">good</span>."

It was <span class="accented">good</span> to him. Hence he ate and drank to his heart's content, enjoying with grateful spirit the bounties of a gracious Providence. By and by he retired to rest, amid visions perchance of a brightened home, which just helped to reflect on his consciousness a stronger resolution than he had ever formed before to make known his affection At length he slept. The Syriac translate adds interpretatively, "<span class="accented">in</span> a sweet sleep or the floor." Ruth then stepped cautiously forth to play her delicate part. She stole softly to the sheltered spot where he lay. She gently uncovered the margin of the cloak, which lay over the place where his feet were laid. She laid herself down noiselessly. The Arabic translator adds, "and slept beside him" - a most unhappy interpretation. Nothing but sin would be so far away as sleep from the eyes, and mind, and heart of the anxious suitor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So she went down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#234;&#183;re&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3381.htm">Strong's 3381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come or go down, descend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the threshing floor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;ren)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1637.htm">Strong's 1637: </a> </span><span class="str2">A threshing-floor, open area</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1429;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ta&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">everything</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her mother-in-law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2545.htm">Strong's 2545: </a> </span><span class="str2">Husband's mother</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had instructed her.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;wat&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person feminine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ruth/3-6.htm">OT History: Ruth 3:6 She went down to the threshing floor (Ru Rut.)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/ruth/3-5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Ruth 3:5"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ruth 3:5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/ruth/3-7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Ruth 3:7"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ruth 3:7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
