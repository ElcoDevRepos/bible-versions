In the context of <a href="/ruth/1-10.htm">Ruth 1:10</a>, it is the response of Ruth and Orpah to Naomi's urging. The dialogue highlights the importance of verbal commitment in relationships, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible, such as in the covenants God makes with His people.<p><b>&#8220;Surely we will return</b><br>The word "surely" emphasizes determination and certainty. This reflects the strong bond and loyalty Ruth and Orpah feel towards Naomi. The concept of returning is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing repentance or a change of direction, as seen in the story of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<p><b>with you</b><br>This phrase underscores companionship and solidarity. Ruth and Orpah's willingness to accompany Naomi reflects the biblical principle of community and support, akin to the fellowship seen in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>). It also foreshadows Ruth's eventual role in Naomi's life, providing support and blessing.<p><b>to your people.&#8221;</b><br>This indicates a willingness to leave behind their own Moabite culture and integrate into the Israelite community. The Moabites and Israelites had a complex history, often marked by conflict (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>). Ruth's decision to join Naomi's people is a significant step of faith and foreshadows her inclusion in the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). This act of leaving one's people for another is reminiscent of Abraham's call to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem in Judah who moved to Moab with her husband and sons during a famine.
