In ancient Near Eastern culture, mothers were seen as primary caregivers, and the cry to their mothers signifies a deep sense of need and vulnerability. The imagery of children crying out highlights the severe impact of the Babylonian siege on the most innocent and defenseless members of society. This reflects the fulfillment of the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, where it is prophesied that during a siege, people would suffer extreme hunger.<p><b>&#8220;Where is the grain and wine?&#8221;</b><br>Grain and wine were staples of the diet in ancient Israel, symbolizing sustenance and joy. The absence of these essentials indicates a severe famine, a common consequence of prolonged sieges in the ancient world. This question underscores the dire conditions in Jerusalem, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a>, where the lack of food and drink is a sign of God's judgment. The mention of grain and wine also contrasts with the abundance promised in times of obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>).<p><b>as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city,</b><br>The comparison to the wounded suggests not only physical weakness due to starvation but also the trauma and suffering experienced during the siege. The streets, once places of community and commerce, have become scenes of despair and death. This imagery is reminiscent of the devastation described in <a href="/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a>, where the city is filled with the dead due to the siege. The fainting children symbolize the collapse of societal structures and the breakdown of normal life.<p><b>as their lives fade away in the arms of their mothers.</b><br>This poignant image emphasizes the personal and familial tragedy of the siege. The arms of the mothers, typically a place of safety and comfort, become the setting for death and loss. This phrase highlights the reversal of expected roles, where mothers, unable to provide for or protect their children, witness their suffering and demise. It echoes the lament in <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, where Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are no more. The fading of life in this context can also be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, where the innocent suffer for the sins of the people, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus for humanity's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_jerusalem.htm">Children of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The verse depicts the suffering of the children during the siege of Jerusalem, highlighting their desperate cries for sustenance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mothers.htm">Mothers</a></b><br>The mothers are portrayed as helpless witnesses to their children's suffering, unable to provide for their basic needs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/streets_of_the_city.htm">Streets of the City</a></b><br>The streets of Jerusalem serve as the setting for this tragic scene, emphasizing the widespread devastation and despair.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_of_jerusalem.htm">Siege of Jerusalem</a></b><br>This event refers to the Babylonian siege that led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a pivotal moment in Jewish history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_jeremiah.htm">Prophet Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah laments the destruction and suffering of his people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br><a href="/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a> serves as a stark reminder of the severe consequences of turning away from God.

He takes sin seriously enough to let its consequences reach even the nursery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Where is the grain and wine?&#8221;</b><p>Grain and wine represent the staples of everyday provision&#8212;food and joy. Their absence shouts famine, but also spiritual emptiness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a> notes that those once &#8220;nurtured in purple&#8221; now scavenge for scraps; prosperity has turned to poverty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a> links grain and wine with gladness granted by God.

The war has left no safe zone; the streets where they once played now double as battleground infirmaries.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/51-20.htm">Isaiah 51:20</a> uses the same imagery of sons who &#8220;faint at every street corner&#8221; to describe covenant judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a> records Jeremiah&#8217;s response: &#8220;My eyes fail from weeping; I have no comfort,&#8221; showing that even the prophet is emotionally spent by viewing the carnage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a> later employs the language of fainting to describe end-time distress, reminding us that human frailty under God&#8217;s judgment is a recurring biblical theme.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As their lives fade away in the arms of their mothers</b><p>The children die where they should be safest&#8212;in a mother&#8217;s embrace.

Hungry children wailing, mothers helpless, streets turned into battlefields&#8212;all testify that sin&#8217;s cost is staggering. Yet the vivid detail also presses readers toward repentance and dependence on the only One who can supply grain, wine, and life itself. Scripture&#8217;s accuracy in portraying both judgment and compassion invites us to trust its every word, seek the Lord while He may be found, and cling to the hope ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who bore judgment so that life might no longer fade away but flourish eternally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They say . . .</span>--The words seem to paint what was actually passing before the writer's eye, but may be the vivid present which represents the past.
