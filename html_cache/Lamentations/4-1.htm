Gold, often symbolizing purity and value, represents the spiritual and moral decay of Jerusalem. In biblical times, gold was used extensively in the temple, signifying God's presence and holiness (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). The tarnishing of gold symbolizes the corruption and defilement of what was once sacred. This imagery can be connected to the spiritual decline of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, where silver becomes dross, indicating moral and spiritual degradation.<p><b>The pure gold has become dull!</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the extent of the decline. Pure gold, which should remain untarnished, becoming dull signifies the complete loss of luster and value. This can be seen as a metaphor for the people of Jerusalem, who were once set apart and holy but have now lost their distinctiveness and righteousness. The dulling of gold can also be seen as a reflection of the people's hearts growing cold and indifferent to God, as warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>, where prosperity leads to forgetfulness of the Lord.<p><b>The gems of the temple lie scattered on every street corner.</b><br>This phrase highlights the desecration and destruction of the temple, which was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The scattering of the temple's gems symbolizes the dispersion and humiliation of the people of Jerusalem. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies regarding the destruction of the temple due to the people's unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>). The scattering of what was once precious and sacred can be seen as a type of Christ, who was rejected and despised, yet became the cornerstone (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who mourns the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city whose destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BC is lamented throughout the book.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_siege.htm">Babylonian Siege</a></b><br>- The event leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, resulting in the scattering of its treasures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_solomon.htm">Temple of Solomon</a></b><br>- The sacred place in Jerusalem, known for its opulence and gold, which was plundered and destroyed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>- The inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah who suffered exile and loss during the Babylonian conquest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_wealth.htm">The Transience of Earthly Wealth</a></b><br>Earthly treasures, like the gold of the temple, are temporary and can be lost or destroyed.

The statement is not poetic exaggeration; the Babylonians literally hauled away or defiled the gold that adorned God&#8217;s house (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17</a>). The prophet&#8217;s cry highlights:<p>&#8226; A shocking reversal&#8212;from breathtaking glory (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20&#8211;22</a>) to grim ruin.<p>&#8226; A reminder that sin always dims what God meant to gleam (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15, 36</a>).<p>&#8226; A warning: if even consecrated gold can be marred through disobedience, nothing on earth is exempt (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the pure gold has become dull</b><p>The phrase intensifies the tragedy. &#8220;Pure&#8221; gold speaks of untarnished devotion and holiness (<a href="/exodus/37-2.htm">Exodus 37:2</a>). Now that very purity is &#8220;dull,&#8221; a visual sermon about Israel&#8217;s lost spiritual luster. Consider:<p>&#8226; God had warned that covenant unfaithfulness would cloud their brightness (<a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; This dulling isn&#8217;t cosmetic; it&#8217;s moral. Like precious metal exposed to foul air, the nation&#8217;s compromise produced visible corrosion (<a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today guard against the same process by clinging to Christ, whose radiance never fades (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The gems of the temple lie scattered on every street corner</b><p>Temple &#8220;gems&#8221; likely include both the actual ornamental stones (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>) and, by extension, the precious sons of Zion mentioned in the next verse (<a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>). Their scattering pictures:<p>&#8226; Desecration&#8212;holy things thrown like common rubble, fulfilling prophetic warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Humiliation&#8212;royal and priestly leaders treated as street debris (<a href="/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine justice&#8212;God allowed enemies to trample the sacred because His people first trampled His covenant (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>Yet even in scattering, hope glimmers: the Lord can regather what He has dispersed (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-8.htm">Zechariah 10:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a> records a literal calamity and a spiritual diagnosis.

Still, the verse indirectly urges repentance and faith in the God who restores shattered treasure and brings tarnished lives back to glory through His unwavering covenant mercy (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21&#8211;23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">How is the gold . . .</span>--The chapter, considered as a distinct poem, reproduces in its general character that of Lamentations 1, 2, differing from them, however, in tracing more fully the connection between the sufferings and the sins of Judah.

The most fine gold has lost its brilliance now that the fire of Nebuzar-adan (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>) has passed over it, and the precious stones, consecrated to Jehovah, have been cast out into the open street!" Not that the latter part of this description can have corresponded to literal fact. None of the hallowed jewels would have been treated with such indifference. The expression must be as figurative as the parallel one, "to cast pearls before swine," in <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>. The precious stones are the "sons of Zion," who are compared to "fine gold" in ver. 2, precisely as they are in <a href="/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (comp. ver. 13," Thy sons, O Zion") to "the stones of a crown." They are called "stones of the sanctuary," in allusion, perhaps, to the precious stones employed in the decoration of the temple according to <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>. But we may also translate <span class="accented">hallowed stones</span>, which better suits the figurative use of the phrase. Those, however, who adopt the literal interpretation, explain "the stones of the sanctuary" of the hewn stones of the fabric of the temple, which are described as "costly" in <a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>. But how can even a poet have represented the enemy as carrying these stones out and throwing them down in the street? On the other hand, in an earlier lamentation we are expressly told that the young children "fainted for hunger in the top of every street" (<a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_349.htm">Strong's 349: </a> </span><span class="str2">How?, how!, where</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has become tarnished,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#8216;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6004.htm">Strong's 6004: </a> </span><span class="str2">To associate, to overshadow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the pure</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
