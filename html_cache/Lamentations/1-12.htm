The city, once vibrant and full of life, now lies in ruins, and the passersby are indifferent to her suffering. This reflects the broader theme of Lamentations, where the prophet Jeremiah mourns the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rhetorical question emphasizes the depth of the city's despair and the callousness of those who witness it. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also suffered while many looked on with indifference, as seen in the Gospels during His crucifixion.<p><b>Look around and see!</b><br>This imperative invites observers to truly perceive the devastation and not just glance superficially. It underscores the need for awareness and empathy. In a broader biblical context, this call to "see" is often used by prophets to urge people to recognize God's actions and the consequences of sin. It echoes the call for spiritual insight and understanding, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42-20.htm">Isaiah 42:20</a>, where seeing but not perceiving is a sign of spiritual blindness.<p><b>Is there any sorrow like mine,</b><br>The comparison of sorrow highlights the unparalleled nature of Jerusalem's suffering. Historically, the fall of Jerusalem was a catastrophic event for the Jewish people, leading to exile and the destruction of the Temple, which was central to their worship and identity. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate sorrow borne by Christ, who took upon Himself the sins of the world, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where He is called "a man of sorrows."<p><b>which was inflicted on me,</b><br>This acknowledges that the suffering is not self-inflicted but comes from an external source. In the context of Lamentations, this refers to the Babylonian siege and destruction. However, it also points to the divine judgment that God allowed to happen due to the people's persistent sin and rebellion. This reflects the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>.<p><b>which the LORD made me suffer</b><br>Here, the text attributes the suffering directly to the LORD, recognizing His sovereignty even in judgment. This aligns with the biblical understanding that God is in control of all events, and His actions are just, even when they involve punishment. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of divine retribution and the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>on the day of His fierce anger?</b><br>The "day of His fierce anger" refers to the time of God's judgment, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's wrath against sin and the consequences of breaking the covenant. It also serves as a warning of the ultimate Day of the Lord, a future time of judgment and restoration prophesied in books like Joel and Zephaniah. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include the final judgment at Christ's return, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where the wrath of God is executed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

The question challenges indifferent spectators, echoing <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17&#8211;18</a>, which warns against gloating at another&#8217;s calamity.<p>&#8226; The line also prefigures the scene at the cross, where &#8220;those who passed by hurled abuse&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>), reminding us that apathy toward suffering&#8212;whether Judah&#8217;s or Christ&#8217;s&#8212;is itself a moral failure.<p>&#8226; On a personal level, the verse invites believers to examine whether we shrug at sin&#8217;s consequences in our communities, like the Levite and priest who &#8220;passed by on the other side&#8221; in <a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31&#8211;32</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look around and see!</b><p>&#8226; The lament moves from rhetorical question to urgent plea: open your eyes. Similar imperatives appear in <a href="/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a> (&#8220;Come, behold the works of the LORD&#8221;) and <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17&#8211;18</a>, where the church at Laodicea is told to &#8220;buy salve so you can see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The call implies that God&#8217;s judgments are visible and instructive, not hidden. <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a> affirms that His attributes are &#8220;clearly seen&#8221; in creation, and here His justice is clearly seen in devastation.<p>&#8226; Application: Notice the spiritual state of our culture, families, and own hearts instead of drifting past the evidence that sin destroys.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is there any sorrow like mine</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem voices incomparable grief, anticipating the Suffering Servant who says, &#8220;A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The uniqueness of the sorrow underscores the severity of covenant breach. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65&#8211;67</a> had warned that disobedience would bring anguish so intense that life itself would seem unbearable.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s agony in Gethsemane (<a href="/mark/14-34.htm">Mark 14:34</a>) fulfills the ultimate expression of sin-borne sorrow, showing that God Himself entered our incomparable grief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which was inflicted on me</b><p>&#8226; The passive construction stresses that the calamity is not random; it has an inflictor. <a href="/psalms/88-7.htm">Psalm 88:7</a> uses the same tone: &#8220;Your wrath lies heavily upon me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This reminds us that divine discipline is purposeful (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;11</a>). The city&#8217;s wounds are surgical strikes meant to bring repentance, not annihilation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which the LORD made me suffer on the day of His fierce anger</b><p>&#8226; The prophet states plainly that God is the Author of the judgment, affirming His sovereign right to correct His people (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The day of His fierce anger&#8221; points forward to the Day of the LORD described in <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14&#8211;18</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>, when unrepentant nations will face the same holy fury.<p>&#8226; Even here, hope glimmers: the same LORD who disciplines promises restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) once the lesson is learned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a> is a piercing call to wake up. Indifference to sin&#8217;s consequences, whether in ancient Jerusalem or today, offends a holy God. The verse compels us to notice, feel, and respond to suffering caused by rebellion, recognizing that the LORD Himself orchestrates discipline to draw hearts back to Him. Ultimately, the unmatched sorrow of Jerusalem points to the greater sorrow borne by Christ, who turns judgment into redemption for all who refuse to &#8220;pass by&#8221; His cross with indifference.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Is it nothing to you . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Not to you, ye passers by, </span>which the Authorised version takes as a question.
