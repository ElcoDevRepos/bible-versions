Unclean!&#8221; men shouted at them.</b><br>This phrase reflects the ritual purity laws found in Leviticus, where those who were considered unclean, such as lepers, were required to live outside the camp and announce their condition (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). In the context of Lamentations, this cry symbolizes the social and spiritual rejection of the people of Jerusalem following the Babylonian conquest. The term "unclean" signifies not only physical impurity but also spiritual defilement due to sin and idolatry, which led to their exile.<p><b>&#8220;Away, away! Do not touch us!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the urgency and desperation of the situation. The command not to touch reflects the fear of contamination, both physically and spiritually. This mirrors the separation from God due to sin, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where iniquities create a barrier between the people and God. The isolation experienced by the exiles is a physical manifestation of their spiritual separation from God.<p><b>So they fled and wandered.</b><br>This phrase captures the aimless and desperate state of the exiles. Historically, after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, many Judeans were forced to flee, becoming refugees in foreign lands. This wandering is reminiscent of Israel's 40 years in the wilderness, a period of testing and reliance on God (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>). It also foreshadows the spiritual wandering of humanity without Christ, the Good Shepherd who leads His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>Among the nations it was said, &#8220;They can stay here no longer.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects the complete rejection and lack of refuge for the exiles among the nations. Historically, the Judeans faced hostility and were often unwelcome in foreign lands, fulfilling the curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>, where God warns of restlessness and fear among the nations. This rejection underscores the need for a true home and rest found only in God, pointing to the ultimate rest and acceptance found in Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are experiencing the consequences of their sin and the resulting judgment from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Surrounding nations witnessing the plight of Jerusalem and responding with rejection and disdain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The event of the Babylonian conquest and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people, which serves as the backdrop for the book of Lamentations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_jeremiah.htm">Prophet Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, he laments the destruction of Jerusalem and the suffering of its people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanliness.htm">Uncleanliness</a></b><br>A state of ritual impurity according to Jewish law, symbolizing the spiritual and moral corruption of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to separation and isolation, both spiritually and communally.

Unclean!&#8221; to protect others from defilement.<p>&#8226; Here the shout is directed at Judah&#8217;s priests and people, picturing them as spiritual lepers whose sin has contaminated the whole community (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned that persistent rebellion would turn the nation from a holy vessel into something detestable (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15, 43</a>). What was once set apart for worship now repels onlookers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Away, away! Do not touch us!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The double command intensifies the rejection. Under the law, touching anything unclean transferred impurity (<a href="/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The populace is treated like a living source of contamination; even casual contact is forbidden.

Each phrase traces a downward spiral&#8212;from being declared unclean, to total social rejection, to restless exile&#8212;fulfilling God&#8217;s warnings while showcasing His righteousness. The verse stands as a sober reminder that sin always isolates, but it also points forward to the hope of cleansing and restoration God provides when His people turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">They cried unto them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> these, as they passed, cried to the blood-stained priests.

There may be an allusion to this, but, though commonly accepted, the view is not certain, as the" leper" in the present case is not the person who raises the cry, but those who meet him. <span class="cmt_word">When they fled away and wandered.</span> The clause is difficult. If the text is correct, Keil's explanation may perhaps pass, "When they fled away, (there) also they wandered," alluding to the "wandering" ascribed to them with a somewhat different shade of meaning in the preceding verso. In any case there ought to be a fuller stop than a comma after "touch not," which words close the first of the two parallel lines of which the verse consists. But very probably "when" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ki</span>) is an intrusion, and we should begin the second line thus: "They fled, they also wandered about." <span class="cmt_word">They said among the heathen,</span> etc. Even in their place of exile they found no rest (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>).
