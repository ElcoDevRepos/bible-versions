The groaning signifies intense suffering and distress, a common theme in Lamentations as the city mourns its destruction by Babylon in 586 BC. The absence of comforters highlights the complete desolation and the failure of allies, such as Egypt, to provide assistance. This echoes the broader biblical theme of seeking comfort in God alone, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, where God is described as a refuge and strength.<p><b>All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that You have caused it.</b><br>Here, the enemies' awareness and delight in Jerusalem's downfall underscore the city's humiliation. Historically, surrounding nations like Edom and Moab rejoiced at Judah's calamity, as they were often in conflict with Israel. This reaction fulfills prophecies of judgment against Jerusalem for its disobedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where God warns of the consequences of turning away from His commandments. The phrase also reflects the justice of God, who uses even adversaries to accomplish His purposes, a theme echoed in <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-11</a>.<p><b>May You bring the day You have announced, so that they may become like me.</b><br>This plea for divine retribution and justice is a call for the fulfillment of God's promises of judgment against the nations that have wronged Israel. The "day You have announced" likely refers to the Day of the Lord, a time of reckoning and restoration prophesied throughout the Old Testament, including in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>. This desire for enemies to experience similar suffering reflects the principle of lex talionis, or an eye for an eye, found in <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate justice and restoration brought by Christ, who will judge the nations and establish His kingdom, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who lamented the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city that has been destroyed, representing the suffering and desolation of the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_jerusalem.htm">Enemies of Jerusalem</a></b><br>- Nations and peoples who opposed Jerusalem and rejoiced in its downfall.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The sovereign being who has allowed the destruction as a consequence of the people's disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_announced.htm">The Day Announced</a></b><br>- Refers to the prophesied day of judgment and restoration, a theme throughout prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_suffering.htm">The Reality of Suffering</a></b><br><a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> highlights the deep suffering and isolation felt by Jerusalem.
