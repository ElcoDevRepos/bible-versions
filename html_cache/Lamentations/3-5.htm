The historical context is the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, which culminated in the city's destruction in 586 BC. The speaker, traditionally identified as the prophet Jeremiah, uses this metaphor to express the overwhelming sense of being trapped and oppressed by God&#8217;s judgment. This reflects the broader theme of divine discipline found throughout the Old Testament, where God allows adversities to bring His people to repentance (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>).<p><b>and surrounded me</b><br>The sense of being surrounded emphasizes the completeness of the affliction. In the ancient world, being surrounded by enemies meant there was no escape, symbolizing total helplessness. This can be connected to <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12-13</a>, where David describes being encircled by enemies, a passage often seen as a messianic prophecy pointing to Christ&#8217;s suffering. The feeling of being hemmed in by circumstances is a common biblical theme, illustrating the need for divine intervention.<p><b>with bitterness</b><br>Bitterness here conveys deep emotional pain and suffering. In the Hebrew Bible, bitterness often symbolizes the consequences of sin and rebellion against God (e.g., <a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>, where the Israelites' lives were made bitter by Egyptian slavery). This term also connects to the "bitter herbs" of the Passover meal, reminding the Israelites of their bondage in Egypt. Theologically, it underscores the reality of suffering as a result of turning away from God, yet it also points to the hope of redemption and deliverance.<p><b>and hardship</b><br>Hardship refers to severe trials and tribulations. The historical context of Lamentations is the aftermath of Jerusalem's fall, a time of extreme suffering for the Jewish people. This word captures the physical and emotional toll of such events. In the New Testament, believers are reminded that hardship can produce perseverance and character (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-4</a>). Theologically, it suggests that while God allows hardship, it is not without purpose, often serving as a means to refine and strengthen faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

Jeremiah draws on that catastrophe to picture the personal, spiritual pressure believers sometimes endure when God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Job felt similarly hemmed in: &#8220;He has blocked my way so I cannot pass&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>).

The literal fall of Jerusalem becomes a timeless lesson: the LORD is sovereign over every siege, present in every encirclement, capable of transforming bitterness, and purposeful in hardship. When we acknowledge His hand, look up instead of out, guard against bitter roots, and embrace the refining process, we discover that the very God who hems us in is the God who will ultimately lift us up.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He hath builded.</span>--The attack of sorrow is presented under the figure of a siege.
