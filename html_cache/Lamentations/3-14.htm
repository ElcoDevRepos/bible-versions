In the context of Lamentations, this lament is set against the backdrop of the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," often faced ridicule and rejection from his own people (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>). His messages of impending judgment were unpopular, leading to his marginalization. This experience of being a "laughingstock" is echoed in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also mocked and rejected by His own people (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>).<p><b>they mock me in song all day long.</b><br>The use of songs or taunts to mock someone was a common cultural practice in the ancient Near East. Such mockery was not only a personal attack but also a communal activity, amplifying the shame and isolation of the individual. This phrase indicates continuous and relentless derision, suggesting that the speaker's suffering is both public and unending. The Psalms also capture similar sentiments of being mocked by enemies (<a href="/psalms/69-12.htm">Psalm 69:12</a>). This relentless mockery can be seen as a type of the suffering servant, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who endured scorn and derision during His passion (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

God&#8217;s servants across generations often face contempt when they speak His truth.<p>&#8226; The pattern ultimately culminated at the cross, where &#8220;those who passed by heaped abuse on Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-29.htm">Mark 15:29</a>). Christ bore the full weight of the mockery pictured here, validating both the prophet&#8217;s cry and the believer&#8217;s hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all my people</b><p>&#8226; The ridicule comes from those who should have been allies&#8212;&#8220;my people.&#8221; Hurt from within the covenant community stings most.<p>&#8226; Similar betrayal is recorded in <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>: &#8220;I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother&#8217;s sons.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Micah&#8217;s era saw families divided over faithfulness to God (<a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>).

Scripture shows this pattern repeated in the lives of Job, David, and ultimately Jesus. Far from indicating God&#8217;s abandonment, such suffering identifies the speaker with a long line of saints who remained true in the face of scorn. Believers today can expect similar pushback, but they can also rest in the God who vindicated Jeremiah and, most importantly, raised Christ in triumph over every mockery.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I was a derision.</span>--The personal experience of the prophet breaks through the succession of imagery.
