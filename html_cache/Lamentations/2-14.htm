Instead of warning them of impending judgment due to their sins, they offered false assurances of peace and prosperity. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>, where God condemns the prophets who speak visions from their own minds rather than from the mouth of the Lord. The emptiness and deception of these visions highlight the danger of false prophecy, which leads people away from repentance and truth.<p><b>they did not expose your guilt to ward off your captivity.</b><br>The role of a true prophet was to call out sin and lead the people to repentance, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. By failing to expose the guilt of the people, these false prophets contributed to the nation's downfall. The captivity referenced here is the Babylonian exile, a direct consequence of Judah's persistent sin and refusal to heed God's warnings. This phrase underscores the importance of acknowledging sin to avoid divine judgment, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>The burdens they envisioned for you were empty and misleading.</b><br>The term "burdens" often refers to prophetic messages or oracles. In this case, the burdens were not from God but were fabricated by the prophets themselves. These misleading messages gave the people a false sense of security, preventing them from turning back to God. This is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/13-3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3-10</a>, where God condemns the prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing. The misleading nature of these burdens ultimately led to the people's destruction, as they were unprepared for the reality of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Judah who were supposed to convey God's messages to the people.
