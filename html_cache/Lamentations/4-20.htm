In the Old Testament, kings were anointed with oil as a sign of their divine appointment (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). The term "anointed" also has messianic implications, pointing to the ultimate Anointed One, Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the perfect king and priest (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, <a href="/acts/4-26.htm">Acts 4:26-27</a>).<p><b>The breath of our life</b><br>This expression highlights the vital role of the king in the life of the nation. The king was seen as a source of protection and stability, much like breath is essential for life. In a broader theological sense, it can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is the true source of life for believers (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>).<p><b>Was captured in their pits</b><br>This refers to the capture of King Zedekiah by the Babylonians, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4-7</a>. The "pits" symbolize the traps and snares set by the enemy, leading to the downfall of the king and the nation. Historically, this event marked the end of the Davidic reign in Jerusalem until the coming of Christ, the eternal King (<a href="/jeremiah/52-8.htm">Jeremiah 52:8-11</a>).<p><b>We had said of him, &#8220;Under his shadow we will live among the nations.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects the hope and expectation that the people of Judah had placed in their king for protection and survival. The "shadow" signifies a place of refuge and safety, akin to the imagery found in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>. However, this hope was misplaced in a human king, pointing to the need for a greater fulfillment in Christ, who provides true and eternal refuge (<a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_anointed.htm">The LORD's Anointed</a></b><br>This refers to the king of Judah, likely King Zedekiah, who was considered God's chosen leader for the people.

God had promised that David&#8217;s throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>), so the king served as a visible sign of God&#8217;s covenant care.<p>&#8226;

He was also, in a sense, the representative of Jehovah with the people. His throne was "the throne of Jehovah" (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>). A similar conception of the king was generally prevalent in antiquity. Most of all among the Egyptians; but, even in imperial Rome, we find Seneca ('De Clementia,' 1:4, quoted by Archbishop Seeker, in Blayney) declaring, "Ille (Princeps) est spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt."
