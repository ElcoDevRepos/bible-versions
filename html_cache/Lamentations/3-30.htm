It echoes the teachings found in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to turn the other cheek. This concept is rooted in the idea of non-retaliation and trusting in God's justice rather than seeking personal vengeance. In the historical context of Lamentations, the Israelites were experiencing the consequences of their disobedience through the Babylonian exile. Offering the cheek symbolizes accepting God's discipline and the hope of eventual restoration. This act of submission can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, during His passion, did not retaliate against those who struck Him (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>).<p><b>let him be filled with reproach.</b><br>Being filled with reproach signifies enduring shame and disgrace, which was a common experience for the Israelites during the Babylonian captivity. This phrase highlights the depth of suffering and humiliation that comes with divine chastisement. In a broader biblical context, reproach is often associated with the consequences of sin and the need for repentance (<a href="/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>). Theologically, it points to the redemptive suffering of Christ, who bore the ultimate reproach on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). This acceptance of reproach is a call to humility and a reminder of the hope for redemption and restoration through God's mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

In <a href="/bsb/lamentations/3.htm">Lamentations 3</a> Jeremiah has just affirmed, &#8220;The LORD is good to those who wait for Him&#8221; (v.25) and urged, &#8220;It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD&#8221; (v.26). Offering one&#8217;s cheek is the outward posture of that quiet waiting. The servant of God, rather than lashing out, surrenders his right to retaliation. Jesus echoed this in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, &#8220;If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also,&#8221; and embodied it in <a href="/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22&#8211;23</a> when He calmly answered the officer who struck Him. The verse calls believers to a meekness that trusts God to vindicate, much like <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a> notes of Christ, &#8220;When He suffered, He made no threats, but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the one who would strike him</b><p>The striker may be a human enemy, a hostile authority, or even circumstances the Lord allows as discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Jeremiah watched foreign invaders &#8220;strike&#8221; Jerusalem, yet he recognized God&#8217;s sovereignty behind the blow (<a href="/lamentations/3-38.htm">Lamentations 3:38</a>). Accepting the strike does not mean applauding evil; it means recognizing God&#8217;s hand is still at work. <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a> prophetically speaks of Messiah who &#8220;gave My back to those who strike Me,&#8221; showing that submission can coexist with ultimate triumph. Paul likewise counseled, &#8220;Bless those who persecute you&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14</a>), leaving judgment to God (v.19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let him be filled with reproach</b><p>Reproach&#8212;public shame, insults, loss of status&#8212;often accompanies faithfulness in a fallen world. Jeremiah was mocked (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-9</a>); Christ was &#8220;despised and rejected&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>); believers may face similar scorn (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). Being &#8220;filled&#8221; with it means experiencing reproach to the full yet refusing to let bitterness take root. <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a> urges, &#8220;Let us go to Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore.&#8221; The resolve to bear reproach flows out of the conviction declared earlier in <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a> that &#8220;the Lord will not cast us off forever&#8230; He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men.&#8221; Hope balances humiliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a> calls the sufferer to a posture of humble acceptance when blows and ridicule come. Offering the cheek, enduring the strike, and bearing reproach are acts of faith that hand vengeance to God and wait for His salvation. This verse points forward to Christ, who perfectly modeled the response Jeremiah prescribed and secured the ultimate vindication promised to all who trust the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">He giveth his cheek . . .</span>--The submission enjoined reaches its highest point--a patience like that of <a href="/job/16-10.htm" title="They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.">Job 16:10</a>; we may add, like that of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>.)
