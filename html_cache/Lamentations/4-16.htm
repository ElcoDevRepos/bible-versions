The scattering is a consequence of their disobedience and idolatry, as seen throughout the prophetic books. The presence of the LORD, which once dwelt in the temple in Jerusalem, is now a source of judgment rather than blessing. This scattering fulfills warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>) and is reminiscent of the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The scattering also prefigures the dispersion of the Jewish people throughout history, including the Babylonian exile.<p><b>He regards them no more.</b><br>This indicates a withdrawal of God's favor and protection, a theme common in the prophetic literature when Israel turns away from God. It echoes the covenantal relationship where blessings are contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>). The phrase suggests a period of divine silence and abandonment, similar to the experience of Jesus on the cross when He cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), highlighting the seriousness of sin and separation from God.<p><b>The priests are shown no honor;</b><br>The priests, who were supposed to be mediators between God and the people, have lost their status and respect due to their own corruption and failure to uphold the law (<a href="/malachi/2.htm">Malachi 2:1-9</a>). This dishonor reflects the broader spiritual decay of the nation. In the New Testament, Jesus criticizes the religious leaders for similar reasons (Matthew 23), and He is presented as the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>), who perfectly mediates between God and humanity.<p><b>the elders find no favor.</b><br>Elders were leaders and decision-makers within the community, expected to guide with wisdom and justice. Their loss of favor indicates a breakdown in societal structure and governance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3:1-5</a>, where the removal of leaders is a sign of judgment. This lack of favor can be contrasted with the New Testament church, where elders are called to shepherd the flock with integrity (<a href="/1_peter/5.htm">1 Peter 5:1-4</a>). The failure of these leaders underscores the need for righteous leadership, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is depicted as actively involved in the judgment and scattering of His people due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel responsible for maintaining the temple worship and teaching the law.

Sin flips blessing into curse; the same God who gathered Israel out of Egypt is fully able to disperse them from Zion (<a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>).<p>&#8226; When the Lord acts, no human barrier stands. Nebuchadnezzar may swing the sword, but behind the armies is the righteous hand of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This line reminds us that every nation, congregation, or family stands secure only as long as God&#8217;s favor rests upon them (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He regards them no more</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;regards&#8221; speaks of God&#8217;s gracious, attentive gaze.

When even these offices lose respect, the social order has collapsed.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law required honoring priests (<a href="/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8</a>) and showing deference to elders (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>). Their public disgrace exposes how deeply sin has corroded the nation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26&#8211;28</a> records similar corruption: priests profane holy things, prophets whitewash sin, and princes devour the people. Disrespect becomes inevitable when leaders themselves abandon God.<p>&#8226; In Christ&#8217;s church, honor for spiritual leaders remains important (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), yet leaders must first be found faithful (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).
