The city, once bustling with life and activity, now lies empty and abandoned. This reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>) about the consequences of Israel's disobedience. The loneliness of the city symbolizes the spiritual desolation and separation from God that the people are experiencing. Jerusalem, the center of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence, is now devoid of its inhabitants, highlighting the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>She who was great among the nations has become a widow.</b><br>Jerusalem was once a significant city, respected and influential among the nations due to its strategic location and the presence of the Temple, which drew people from various regions. The term "widow" signifies the loss of protection and provision, as well as the deep sorrow and vulnerability that comes with such a status. This imagery is used to convey the drastic change in Jerusalem's status and fortune. The city, once under God's favor and protection, now stands alone, bereft of its former glory and alliances. This transformation serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>The princess of the provinces has become a slave.</b><br>Jerusalem is personified as a princess, indicating her former status of honor and authority over the surrounding regions. The term "provinces" refers to the territories that were once under Jerusalem's influence or control. The shift from a princess to a slave underscores the complete reversal of fortunes due to the Babylonian conquest. This imagery highlights the humiliation and subjugation of the city and its people. Theologically, it reflects the spiritual bondage that results from sin and rebellion against God. This transformation can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though He was in the form of God, took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), identifying with the suffering and humiliation of humanity to bring redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city referred to in this verse, once bustling and full of life, now lies desolate.

His lament teaches that sin always hollows out what once seemed vibrant (<a href="/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She who was great among the nations has become a widow.</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;She who was great among the nations has become a widow.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Great among the nations&#8221; recalls the height of David&#8217;s and Solomon&#8217;s reigns when surrounding kingdoms paid tribute (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;widow&#8221; lacks both protection and provision.

Each verse is divided into three lines, each line beginning, in the Hebrew, with the same letter. The opening picture reminds us of the well-known <span class= "ital">Jud?a capta, </span>a woman sitting under a palm-tree, on the Roman medals struck after the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">How is</span> <span class= "bld">she become.</span>--Better, making one sentence instead of two, <span class= "ital">She is become a widow that was great among the nations, </span>and so with the clause that follows.<p><span class= "bld">Provinces.</span>--The word, used in <a href="/esther/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)">Esther 1:1</a>; <a href="/esther/1-22.htm" title="For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.">Esther 1:22</a>, and elsewhere, of the countries subject to Persia and Assyria and so in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm" title="Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city;">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-6.htm" title="These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;">Nehemiah 7:6</a>, of Judah itself, here indicates the neighbouring countries that had once, as in the reign of Hezekiah, been subject to Judah. "Tributary," as used here, implies, as in <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm" title="And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.">Joshua 16:10</a>, personal servitude, rather than the money payment, for which, at a later period, as in <a href="/esther/10-1.htm" title="And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the isles of the sea.">Esther 10:1</a>, it was commuted. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How</span>.

We are not to press the phrase, "a widow," as if some. earthly or heavenly husband were alluded to; it is a kind of symbol of desolation and misery (comp. <a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). "The provinces" at once suggests the period of the writer, who must have been a subject of the Babylonian empire. The term is also frequently used of the countries under the Persian rule (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1, 22</a>), and in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a> is used of Judah itself. Here, however, the "provinces," like the "nations," must be the countries formerly subject to David and Solomon (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
