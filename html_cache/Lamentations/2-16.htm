In the ancient Near East, open hostility was often expressed verbally, and the imagery of enemies opening their mouths suggests both verbal assault and the intent to devour. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>, where the psalmist describes enemies as "roaring lions tearing their prey." The enemies' actions fulfill the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold the consequences of Israel's disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16-17</a>).<p><b>They hiss and gnash their teeth,</b><br>Hissing was a common expression of scorn and derision in ancient cultures, akin to booing today. Gnashing of teeth indicates intense anger or frustration, often used in the Bible to describe the reaction of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>). This phrase underscores the deep-seated animosity and satisfaction of Jerusalem's enemies at her downfall. It also reflects the fulfillment of divine judgment, as God allowed these nations to act as instruments of His wrath due to Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>saying, &#8220;We have swallowed her up.</b><br>The imagery of swallowing suggests complete destruction and consumption, indicating that Jerusalem's enemies believed they had utterly defeated her. This echoes the language of <a href="/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a>, where the psalmist speaks of being swallowed alive by enemies. The phrase highlights the perceived finality of Jerusalem's fall, yet it also sets the stage for God's eventual restoration, as seen in the broader narrative of Scripture.<p><b>This is the day for which we have waited.</b><br>The enemies' anticipation of Jerusalem's downfall suggests a long-standing enmity and desire for revenge. Historically, nations like Babylon and Edom harbored animosity towards Israel, and their actions during the siege of Jerusalem were seen as the culmination of these hostilities. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the prophetic warnings given to Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>, where God warned of a day of reckoning if His people turned away from Him.<p><b>We have lived to see it!&#8221;</b><br>The exclamation of having lived to witness Jerusalem's destruction indicates the fulfillment of long-held desires and prophecies. For the enemies, it was a moment of triumph, but for Israel, it was a moment of profound loss and reflection. This phrase underscores the reality of God's judgment but also points to the hope of future redemption, as God promises to restore His people and city in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>. The lamentation serves as a call to repentance and trust in God's ultimate plan for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who lamented the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city that is the focal point of Lamentations, representing the heart of Judah and the center of Jewish worship, now lying in ruins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_jerusalem.htm">Enemies of Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The surrounding nations and peoples who opposed Israel and Judah, often rejoicing in their downfall.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_conquest.htm">Babylonian Conquest</a></b><br>- The historical event where Babylon, under King Nebuchadnezzar, besieged and destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>- A concept often associated with judgment and fulfillment of prophecy, seen here as a day of reckoning for Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_judgment.htm">The Reality of Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and often comes as a result of persistent disobedience.

The verse testifies to God&#8217;s justice&#8212;He permits hostile nations to celebrate only because Judah&#8217;s persistent sin demanded judgment.
