In the ancient Near East, vassal states often sent tribute to more powerful rulers to maintain peace and political favor. The "tribute lambs" symbolize a gesture of submission and acknowledgment of authority. This practice is seen in <a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>, where the Moabites sent tribute to the king of Israel. Theologically, this can be seen as a call for humility and recognition of God's sovereignty, as rulers and nations are ultimately under His dominion.<p><b>from Sela in the desert</b><br>Sela, meaning "rock" in Hebrew, is identified with the city of Petra in modern-day Jordan. It was a significant Edomite city known for its strategic location and impressive rock-cut architecture. The mention of "the desert" highlights the arid and rugged terrain of the region, emphasizing the difficulty and effort involved in sending the tribute. This geographical reference underscores the historical tensions between Moab and Israel, as well as the broader context of regional politics in the ancient Near East.<p><b>to the mount of Daughter Zion</b><br>"Daughter Zion" is a poetic term for Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. The "mount" refers to the elevated position of the city, symbolizing its importance and strength. This phrase indicates the destination of the tribute, suggesting a plea for protection or alliance with Jerusalem. In a prophetic sense, Zion often represents the future hope and restoration of God's people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>. Theologically, it points to the ultimate reign of God and the establishment of His kingdom, with Jerusalem as a central figure in biblical prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Moab is being urged to acknowledge Judah&#8217;s God-appointed authority rather than resist it.<p>&#8226; The picture also echoes the sacrificial language familiar to every Israelite (<a href="/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>), reminding us that God expects humble offerings rather than proud defiance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the ruler of the land</b><p>The tribute is directed &#8220;to the ruler of the land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Historically, that ruler was the Davidic king in Jerusalem&#8212;likely Hezekiah during Isaiah&#8217;s ministry (<a href="/2_kings/18-1.htm">2 Kings 18:1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Davidic line prefigures Christ (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>), the verse hints at a deeper call: nations must honor the ultimate King God sets on Zion (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; In practical terms, Moab&#8217;s safety rests not in alliances with pagan powers (cf. <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>) but in yielded recognition of the Lord&#8217;s chosen authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Sela in the desert</b><p>The route begins &#8220;from Sela in the desert.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Sela (&#8220;rock&#8221;) refers to the fortress-city south of the Dead Sea (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>).

On his revolt (as recorded in the <span class= "ital">Moabite Inscription</span>) that tribute had ceased. The prophet now calls on the Moabites to renew it, not to the northern kingdom, which was on the point of extinction, but to the king of Judah as the true "ruler of the land." The name Sela ("a rock") may refer either to the city so-called (better known by its Greek name of Petra), <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>, or to the rock-district of Edom and the confines of Moab generally. In either case the special direction implies that the presence of the invaders described in Isaiah 15 would make it impossible to send the tribute across the fords of the Jordan, and that it must accordingly be sent by the southern route, which passed through Sela and the desert country to the south of the Dead Sea (Cheyne). Possibly the words are a summons to Edom, which had attacked Judah in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17</a>), to join in a like submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - THE BURDEN OF MOAB (CONTINUED). This portion of the "burden" is divided into three sections. In section 1 (from ver. 1 to the end of ver. 5) an offer of mercy is made to Moab on certain conditions, viz. that she return to her allegiance to the house of David, and show kindness to fugitive Israelites. In section 2 (vers. 6-12) she is supposed to have rejected this offer, and is threatened (as in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>.) with severe punishment. In section 3 (which consists of vers. 13 and 14) the time is fixed for the main visitation to fall upon her. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lamb of the ruler of the land -</span> the lamb (or lambs, <span class="accented">kar</span> being used collectively) due to the ruler as a mark of subjection. In the time of Ahab Mesha had paid a tribute to Israel of a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams annually (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The prophet recommends that this, or some similar, tribute should now be paid to the King of Judah instead. Israel having been absorbed into Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">From Sela</span>. Either Moab is regarded as having taken refuge in Edom, and is therefore bidden to send her tribute from the Edomite capital, Sela (equivalent to "Petra"), or "Sela," here is not a proper name, but a collective used to designate the rocky parts of Moab, to which she had betaken herself (as in <a href="/jeremiah/48-28.htm">Jeremiah 48:28</a>). The latter supposition is, on the whole, the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">To the wilderness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wildernesswards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the way of the wilderness.
