In the context of <a href="/isaiah/21.htm">Isaiah 21</a>, this could refer to the Babylonians who are unaware of the impending judgment. The imagery of a prepared table is often used in Scripture to denote abundance and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>), but here it is ironic, as it precedes a call to arms.<p><b>they lay out a carpet</b><br>The laying out of a carpet may symbolize luxury and opulence, common in the courts of ancient Near Eastern kings. This act of spreading a carpet could also imply preparation for a significant event or gathering. In the context of Isaiah, it underscores the complacency of those who are about to face divine judgment.<p><b>they eat, they drink!</b><br>Eating and drinking are typical activities of a feast, indicating a time of joy and relaxation. However, in prophetic literature, such scenes often precede sudden disaster (<a href="/luke/17-27.htm">Luke 17:27-28</a>). This phrase highlights the obliviousness of the people to the looming threat, reminiscent of Belshazzar's feast in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>, where revelry is interrupted by the fall of Babylon.<p><b>Rise up, O princes</b><br>This call to action is directed at the leaders, urging them to awaken from their complacency. The term "princes" suggests those in positions of authority who are responsible for the defense and well-being of the nation. The urgency of the command indicates an imminent threat, aligning with the prophetic theme of sudden judgment.<p><b>oil the shields!</b><br>Oiling shields was a common practice in ancient warfare to maintain the leather's flexibility and prevent it from becoming brittle. This preparation for battle contrasts sharply with the preceding scene of feasting, emphasizing the need for readiness. The call to "oil the shields" serves as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance and preparedness, echoing the New Testament exhortation to be ready for the Lord's return (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/21.htm">Isaiah 21</a> is a prophecy concerning the fall of Babylon.

Believers are called to remain vigilant and spiritually prepared, even when life seems secure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_readiness.htm">Urgency of Readiness</a></b><br>The command to "oil the shields" signifies the need for readiness and preparation. In spiritual terms, this means maintaining a strong faith and being prepared for spiritual battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_responsibility.htm">Leadership Responsibility</a></b><br>The call to the princes underscores the responsibility of leaders to be alert and proactive in protecting those under their care. Christian leaders are tasked with guiding others in spiritual preparedness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The imagery of preparing shields points to the reality of spiritual warfare. Christians must be equipped with the armor of God to stand firm against spiritual threats.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment.htm">Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The prophecy against Babylon serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of divine judgment.

The picture is one of confident banquet planning&#8212;no hint that danger could be near.<p>&#8226; Similar complacency marks Belshazzar&#8217;s great feast the very night Babylon fell (<a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that luxurious ease can dull spiritual alertness (<a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They lay out a carpet</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They lay out a carpet&#8221; suggests spreading rich rugs or cushions for reclining guests&#8212;an added touch of opulence.<p>&#8226; The detail underscores the wealth of Babylon, matching <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>&#8217;s description of the &#8220;oppressor&#8221; in splendor.<p>&#8226; While guests focus on comfort, God&#8217;s prophecy continues to advance unhindered (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They eat, they drink</b><p>&#8226; The revelers plunge into food and wine, heightening the contrast between human indulgence and divine judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3&#8211;4</a> records the same careless drinking party, even praising idols with vessels taken from God&#8217;s temple.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a> foretold, &#8220;When they become heated, I will prepare them a feast and make them drunk, so that they may shout with laughter&#8212;then sleep forever.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rise up, O princes</b><p>&#8226; Abruptly the banquet mood shatters: &#8220;Rise up, O princes.&#8221; The call reaches Babylon&#8217;s leaders too late.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8&#8211;11</a> echoes the suddenness&#8212;disaster falls in &#8220;a moment, in a single day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The shift illustrates <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>: &#8220;While people are saying, &#8216;Peace and security,&#8217; destruction comes upon them suddenly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oil the shields</b><p>&#8226; Soldiers in the ancient Near East rubbed leather shields with oil to keep them supple and battle-ready (<a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The command implies an enemy already at the gates&#8212;likely the Medes and Persians (<a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today are urged to maintain spiritual readiness just as carefully (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a> paints Babylon&#8217;s final hours: lavish preparations, carefree feasting, and then a jarring summons to battle. The verse warns that worldly security can vanish in an instant and calls God&#8217;s people to vigilant readiness, confident that every prophetic word will be fulfilled exactly as spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower.</span>--The words (historical infinitive) are better taken as indicative: <span class= "ital">They prepare </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">they watch. </span>The last clause has been variously rendered, <span class= "ital">they spread the coverlet; i.e., </span>for the couches of the revellers (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4</a>); and <span class= "ital">they take a horoscopes </span>(Ewald). Here, with hardly a shadow of a doubt, there is a reference to the temper of reckless revel such as was the immediate forerunner of the capture of Babylon. The prophet had, perhaps, an analogue of such blind security before his eyes at the very time he wrote (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>), which led him to anticipate a like state of things in Babylon.<p><span class= "bld">Anoint the shield . . .</span>--The summons is one which in the prophet's vision breaks in on the songs and music of the revel. The shields thought of were those covered with leather, which was oiled, partly to protect it from wet, partly to make the stroke of the sword glide off from it. The call implies that even this precaution had been neglected by the revellers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the table</span>, etc. With lyrical abruptness, the prophet turns from his own feelings to draw a picture of Babylon at the time when she is attacked. He uses historical infinitives, the most lively form of narrative. Translate, <span class="accented">They deck the table</span>, <span class="accented">set the watch</span>, <span class="accented">eat</span>, <span class="accented">drink</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> having decked the table, they commit the task of watching to a few, and then give themselves up to feasting and reveling, as if there were no danger. It is impossible not to think of Belshazzar's feast, and the descriptions of the Greek historians (Herod., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:23), which mark at any rate the strength of the tradition that, when Babylon was taken, its inhabitants were engaged in revelry. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</span> In the midst of the feast there enters to the revellers one from the outside, with these words, "Rise, quit the banquet; get your shields; anoint them; arm yourselves." That shields were greased with fat or oil before being used in battle appears from Virg., 'AEneid,' 7:625, and other places.
