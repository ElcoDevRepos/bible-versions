This place became a symbol of judgment and divine wrath. The preparation of Topheth signifies God's longstanding plan for judgment against sin and rebellion. The imagery of preparation suggests intentionality and inevitability, reflecting God's sovereign justice.<p><b>it has been made ready for the king.</b><br>The "king" here likely refers to the Assyrian king, representing the enemies of God's people. This phrase underscores the certainty of divine judgment against those who oppose God. Historically, Assyria was a dominant power threatening Israel and Judah, and this prophecy assures that even mighty rulers are subject to God's justice.<p><b>Its funeral pyre is deep and wide,</b><br>The description of the funeral pyre as "deep and wide" emphasizes the thoroughness and completeness of the judgment. In ancient times, a funeral pyre was used for burning the dead, symbolizing the total destruction of the wicked. This imagery conveys the inescapable and all-encompassing nature of God's judgment.<p><b>with plenty of fire and wood.</b><br>The abundance of fire and wood signifies the intensity and sufficiency of the judgment. Fire is often used in Scripture as a symbol of purification and destruction. The plentiful resources for the pyre indicate that God's judgment is both adequate and overwhelming, leaving no room for escape or survival.<p><b>The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.</b><br>The "breath of the LORD" represents His divine power and authority. The comparison to "burning sulfur" evokes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, highlighting the severity and finality of divine judgment. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the ultimate accountability of all creation to His righteous standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/topheth.htm">Topheth</a></b><br>A location in the Valley of Hinnom, historically associated with child sacrifices to the god Molech.
