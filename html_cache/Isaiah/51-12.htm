The repetition of "I, even I" highlights God's personal involvement and commitment to His people. This echoes earlier assurances found in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where God promises comfort to His people. The comfort offered by God is not just emotional but also spiritual, providing strength and hope in times of distress. This reflects God's covenant relationship with Israel, where He consistently acts as their protector and provider. The comfort here can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate comforter, the Holy Spirit, promised in the New Testament (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>).<p><b>Why should you be afraid of mortal man,</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the fear of human opposition, reminding the audience of the transient nature of human power. In the historical context, Israel often faced threats from powerful nations like Assyria and Babylon. However, God reassures them that these threats are insignificant compared to His eternal power. This theme is consistent throughout scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>, which states, "The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?" It encourages believers to place their trust in God rather than fearing human adversaries.<p><b>of a son of man who withers like grass?</b><br>The phrase "son of man" is a Hebrew idiom for humanity, emphasizing human frailty and mortality. The imagery of grass, which withers and fades, is a common biblical metaphor for the fleeting nature of human life (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). This serves as a reminder of the impermanence of human strength and the futility of relying on it. In contrast, God's word and promises endure forever, offering a stark contrast to the temporary nature of human existence. This also points to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where human powers will fade, but God's reign will be everlasting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, emphasizing His role as the ultimate comforter and the eternal, sovereign Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message to the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of this message, who were experiencing fear and uncertainty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mortal_man.htm">Mortal Man</a></b><br>Represents humanity, emphasizing their transient and fragile nature compared to God's eternal power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grass.htm">Grass</a></b><br>A metaphor for the fleeting and temporary nature of human life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_ultimate_comforter.htm">God as the Ultimate Comforter</a></b><br>Recognize that true comfort comes from God, who is eternal and unchanging, unlike the temporary comforts of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_human_life.htm">The Transience of Human Life</a></b><br>Understand the metaphor of grass to remind us of the fleeting nature of human life and the importance of focusing on eternal matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_fear.htm">Misplaced Fear</a></b><br>Reflect on where we place our fear and trust.
