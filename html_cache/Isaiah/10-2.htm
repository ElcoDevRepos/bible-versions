The poor were often marginalized and denied their rights, contrary to the Mosaic Law, which emphasized justice and care for the less fortunate (<a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>). The prophets frequently condemned such practices, calling for repentance and a return to God's standards (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>). This reflects God's heart for justice and His concern for the vulnerable, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>).<p><b>and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people</b><br>The phrase underscores the failure of leaders to uphold justice, a key responsibility in theocratic Israel. The oppressed, often the poor and marginalized, were denied their rights, leading to societal decay. This injustice is a violation of God's covenant, which required leaders to act justly (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>). The phrase "My people" indicates God's personal relationship with Israel, highlighting the betrayal of divine trust. This theme of justice is central to the prophetic message and is fulfilled in Christ, who brings ultimate justice (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>).<p><b>to make widows their prey</b><br>Widows, among the most vulnerable in ancient society, were often exploited due to their lack of protection and resources. The Mosaic Law provided specific protections for widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17-21</a>), and their mistreatment was a serious offense against God. This exploitation is a sign of moral decay and a departure from God's commands. The New Testament continues this concern, with <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> emphasizing care for widows as true religion.<p><b>and orphans their plunder</b><br>Orphans, like widows, were particularly vulnerable and often subject to exploitation. The law commanded care for orphans (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>), reflecting God's compassion for the fatherless. The prophets frequently condemned the mistreatment of orphans, viewing it as a sign of societal corruption (<a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus' ministry reflects God's heart for the vulnerable, and believers are called to care for orphans as part of living out the gospel (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
