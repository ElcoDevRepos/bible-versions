It was a significant political and cultural center during various periods of Egyptian history. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>, Zoan represents the political power and influence of Egypt. The mention of princes at Zoan suggests that the leaders of Judah were seeking alliances with Egypt, relying on its strength rather than trusting in God. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where Israel and Judah often turned to foreign powers for help instead of relying on divine guidance. Theologically, this can be seen as a lack of faith and a failure to trust in God's provision and protection.<p><b>and their envoys have arrived in Hanes</b><br>Hanes is less well-known than Zoan, and its exact location is uncertain, though it is believed to be another city in Egypt. The arrival of envoys in Hanes indicates a formal diplomatic mission, emphasizing the seriousness with which Judah pursued an alliance with Egypt. This action is historically significant as it demonstrates the political maneuvering of Judah during a time of threat from Assyria. Theologically, this reliance on Egypt is criticized by the prophets, including Isaiah, as it symbolizes a turning away from God. The prophets often warned against such alliances, urging the people to trust in God alone. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where reliance on human strength and wisdom is contrasted with faith in God's power and plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a></b><br>Refers to the leaders or officials of Judah who are seeking help from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zoan.htm">Zoan</a></b><br>An ancient city in Egypt, known for its wisdom and as a center of political power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/envoys.htm">Envoys</a></b><br>Messengers or representatives sent by Judah to negotiate with Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanes.htm">Hanes</a></b><br>Another location in Egypt, possibly a place of strategic or political importance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah's_reliance_on_egypt.htm">Judah's Reliance on Egypt</a></b><br>The event where Judah seeks an alliance with Egypt for protection against Assyria, rather than relying on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_trust.htm">Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>Judah's reliance on Egypt symbolizes misplaced trust in human power rather than divine strength.<br><br>Application: Evaluate where you place your trust in times of trouble.

The princes represent Judah&#8217;s highest officials&#8212;people who should have been turning the nation God-ward (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>), yet they are headed in the opposite direction, leaning on Egypt instead of the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s tone is ironic: even if the mission reaches Zoan&#8217;s corridors of power, the alliance will still prove empty (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting Zoan, the Spirit underlines how far Judah is willing to travel&#8212;geographically and spiritually&#8212;to avoid trusting God (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>;

Zoan, the Tanis of the Greeks, was one of the oldest of Egyptian cities.

"Zoan" is undoubtedly Tanis, which is now "San," a heap of ruins in the Delta, where some interesting remains of the shepherd-kings have been discovered. It was a favorite capital of the monarchs of the nineteenth dynasty, and seems to have been the scene of the struggle between Moses and the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12, 43</a>). It then declined, but is said to have been the birthplace of the first king of the twenty-first dynasty. In the Ethiopian period it rose once more to some importance, and was at one time the capital of a principality (see G. Smith's 'Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 21, 26, 32). The "<span class="accented">princes"</span> here spoken of are probably Hezekiah's ambassadors. <span class="cmt_word">His ambassadors came to Hanes</span>. "Hanes" has been generally identified with the modern Esnes, a village between Memphis and Thebes, which is thought to mark the site of Hera-cleopolis Magna. But it has been well remarked that the Jewish envoys would scarcely have proceeded so far. Mr. R.S. Peele suggests, instead of Esnes, Tahpenes, or Daphnae ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 753); but that name is somewhat remote from Hanes. Perhaps it would be best to acknowledge that "Hanes" cannot at present be identified. It was probably not very far from Tanis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/30-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For though</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their princes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
