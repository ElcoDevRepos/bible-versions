It connects to other prophetic books like <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14:1</a>, which also speak of "that day" as a time of significant divine action.<p><b>Sing about a fruitful vineyard:</b><br>The vineyard is a recurring symbol in the Bible, often representing Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). In this context, the vineyard is described as fruitful, indicating a time of blessing and prosperity. This contrasts with earlier depictions of Israel as a vineyard that produced wild grapes, symbolizing unfaithfulness and judgment. The call to "sing" suggests a response of joy and celebration, reflecting the restoration and favor of God. This imagery is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus uses the vineyard as a metaphor for the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>). The fruitful vineyard can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), and through whom believers bear fruit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's people, often Israel, representing a place of care, cultivation, and expected fruitfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day.htm">The Day</a></b><br>Refers to a future time of restoration and blessing, often associated with the Messianic age or the end times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_singer.htm">The Singer</a></b><br>Implied to be those who witness or partake in God's redemptive work, possibly the redeemed community or the prophet himself.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fruitfulness.htm">The Fruitfulness</a></b><br>Represents the spiritual prosperity and blessings that come from being in right relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song.htm">The Song</a></b><br>A metaphor for joy and celebration, indicating a time of peace and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care_and_cultivation.htm">God's Care and Cultivation</a></b><br>Just as a vineyard requires care, God tends to His people with love and discipline, expecting spiritual growth and fruitfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_redemption.htm">The Joy of Redemption</a></b><br>The call to sing about a fruitful vineyard reflects the joy and celebration that comes with God's redemptive work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_as_evidence_of_faith.htm">Fruitfulness as Evidence of Faith</a></b><br>True faith in God should result in spiritual fruit, such as love, joy, peace, and other fruits of the Spirit, as evidence of a transformed life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_abiding_in_christ.htm">The Importance of Abiding in Christ</a></b><br>As branches must remain connected to the vine to bear fruit, believers must remain in Christ through prayer, scripture, and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_future_restoration.htm">Hope in Future Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of a fruitful vineyard points to the ultimate restoration and peace that God will bring, encouraging believers to remain hopeful and faithful.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_27_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 27:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_27_2_inspire_growth.htm">How does Isaiah 27:2 encourage us to cultivate our spiritual "fruitful vineyard"?

This piece may be called a companion picture to <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, or a joy-song to be set over against that dirge. In both the figure of the vineyard is employed to express the people of God, and God is "the Lord of the vineyard." But whereas, on the former occasion, all was wrath and fury, menace and judgment, here all is mercy and loving-kindness, protection and promise. The difference is, no doubt, not with God, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), but with the vineyard, which is either not the same, or, if the same, then differently circumstanced. The vineyard of <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. is beyond all doubt the Jewish Church in the time of Isaiah, or in the times shortly after. The vineyard of the present place is either the Christian Church, or the Jewish Church reformed and purified by suffering. It is not the Church triumphant in heaven, since there are still "briars and thorns" in it, and there are still those belonging to it who have to "make their peace with God." The prophet has come back from his investigations of the remote future and the supra-mundane sphere to something which belongs to earth, and perhaps not to a very distant period. His second "song of the vineyard" may well comfort the Church through all her earthly struggles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing ye unto her</span>. Our translators have, strangely enough, inverted the order of the two clauses, which stand thus in the Hebrew: "A vineyard of red wine; sing ye unto it, "or "sing ye of it." The "vineyard of red wine" is one that produces abundance of rich fruit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/27-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Sing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;an&#183;n&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6030.htm">Strong's 6030: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer, respond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about a fruitful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1430;&#1502;&#1462;&#1491;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;me&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, delight</span><br /><br /><span class="word">vineyard.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ke&#183;rem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">A garden, vineyard</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/27-2.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 27:2 In that day sing to her (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 27:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 27:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 27:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 27:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
