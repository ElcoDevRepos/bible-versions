The imagery of fleeing to caverns and cliffs is symbolic of seeking safety and protection, yet it also conveys a sense of desperation and fear. Biblically, this echoes the fear and hiding seen in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a>, where Adam and Eve hide from God. It also parallels <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>, where people hide in caves from the wrath of the Lamb, indicating a consistent biblical theme of humanity's instinct to hide from divine judgment.<p><b>away from the terror of the LORD</b><br>The "terror of the LORD" signifies the overwhelming fear and awe that God's presence and judgment inspire. This phrase underscores God's holiness and the rightful fear that comes with His judgment. In the context of Isaiah, it reflects the coming judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem for their sins. Theologically, it points to the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), emphasizing the need for reverence and repentance.<p><b>and from the splendor of His majesty</b><br>This phrase highlights the contrast between human sinfulness and God's majestic holiness. The "splendor of His majesty" refers to God's glorious and awe-inspiring presence. In biblical theology, God's majesty is often associated with His kingship and divine authority (<a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>). This splendor is both beautiful and terrifying to those who are unrepentant, as it reveals their inadequacy and sinfulness.<p><b>when He rises to shake the earth</b><br>The imagery of God rising to shake the earth is a powerful depiction of divine intervention and judgment. This phrase can be connected to eschatological themes found in prophetic literature, where God intervenes in history to establish His kingdom (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>). The shaking of the earth symbolizes a cosmic upheaval, a reordering of creation that accompanies God's judgment and the establishment of His righteousness. It also foreshadows the ultimate shaking at the end of the age, when Christ returns to judge the living and the dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
