It connects to the prophetic vision of restoration and redemption found throughout Isaiah. The phrase "in that day" is frequently used in prophetic literature to denote a significant time of divine intervention.<p><b>O LORD, I will praise You.</b><br>The use of "O LORD" signifies a personal and covenantal relationship with Yahweh, the God of Israel. Praise is a common response to God's acts of salvation and deliverance, as seen in the Psalms and other biblical texts. This reflects a heart of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and goodness.<p><b>Although You were angry with me,</b><br>This acknowledges God's righteous anger due to Israel's sin and rebellion. The concept of divine anger is consistent with God's holiness and justice, as seen in the covenantal curses outlined in Deuteronomy. It reflects the reality of God's discipline as a response to disobedience.<p><b>Your anger has turned away,</b><br>This indicates a change in God's disposition, often associated with repentance and forgiveness. It echoes themes of reconciliation and restoration found in the prophetic writings. The turning away of God's anger is a result of His mercy and grace, which are central to the biblical narrative of redemption.<p><b>and You have comforted me.</b><br>Comfort is a recurring theme in Isaiah, especially in the latter chapters, where God promises consolation to His people. This comfort is both immediate and eschatological, pointing to the ultimate comfort found in the Messiah. It reflects God's compassion and the restoration of a broken relationship, aligning with the hope and peace promised in the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

He has been taught that confession must be blended with thanksgiving--that those only can rightly estimate the comfort which God gives who have first felt His wrath. The fact that the prophet appears as a psalmist was a natural result of the training of the schools of the prophets, as described in <a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>, possibly also of his familiarity with the Temple service as a priest or Levite. The group of psalms ascribed to the sons of Korah presents so many parallelisms to the writings of Isaiah, and so obviously belongs to the same period, that we may reasonably think of him as having been associated with that goodly company.

On each of her deliverances the Church is hound to praise God. In some parts of the Church it is customary on every such occasion to sing a "Te Deum." The ordinary Israelite hymn of praise appears to have been the hundred and thirty-sixth psalm (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34, 41</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>; 1 Macc. 4:24); but on extraordinary occasions special thanksgivings were sung (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>; 1 Samuel 7:18-29, etc.). Isaiah is now inspired to give a pattern song, suitable for the Church to sing when she is reunited, enlarged, and restored to favor. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>.

Kay understands an actual hank-fullness for the severe discipline, which had checked them, and not allowed them to glide on smoothly to ruin.
