Isaiah, a major prophet in the Old Testament, often served as a mouthpiece for God, delivering messages of both judgment and hope. His role as a prophet was crucial during times of national crisis, such as the Assyrian threat.<p><b>Tell your master that this is what the LORD says</b><br>Isaiah is instructed to convey a message directly from God to King Hezekiah. This underscores the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. The phrase "this is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, emphasizing the divine authority behind the message. It assures Hezekiah that the words are not merely human counsel but divine instruction.<p><b>Do not be afraid of the words you have heard</b><br>This reassurance addresses the fear and anxiety caused by the Assyrian threats. Fear is a common human response to danger, but God often commands His people not to fear, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>. The command not to fear is a call to trust in God's sovereignty and power over any earthly threat.<p><b>with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me</b><br>The Assyrian officials, representing King Sennacherib, had spoken arrogantly against the God of Israel, equating Him with the powerless gods of other nations. This blasphemy is not just an insult to Israel but a direct challenge to God's honor and power. The historical context here involves the Assyrian Empire, known for its military might and conquests, which often led to the subjugation and humiliation of other nations and their deities. This situation sets the stage for God to demonstrate His supremacy over all nations and gods, as He did in the Exodus narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah served as a messenger of God, delivering His words to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
