Tirhakah, the king of Cush (modern-day Sudan and parts of Egypt), was a significant figure in the 25th Dynasty of Egypt. This mention indicates the geopolitical tensions of the time, as Cush was a powerful kingdom. The warning suggests a strategic threat to Sennacherib, highlighting the complex alliances and enmities in the region. This context underscores the historical reality of the biblical narrative, where empires often clashed for dominance.<p><b>&#8220;He has set out to fight against you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates an imminent military confrontation. The movement of Tirhakah's forces against Sennacherib suggests a coalition against Assyrian expansion. Historically, such coalitions were common as smaller states and kingdoms sought to resist the overwhelming power of empires like Assyria. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using various nations to fulfill His purposes, often involving judgment or deliverance.<p><b>On hearing this, Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</b><br>Sennacherib's response to the threat from Tirhakah was to send messengers to Hezekiah, king of Judah. This action reveals Sennacherib's strategic approach, attempting to secure his position by addressing potential threats on multiple fronts. Hezekiah, a king noted for his faithfulness to God, was under pressure from Assyria. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for God's intervention on behalf of Judah. The sending of messengers is a common diplomatic practice in ancient times, reflecting the importance of communication in warfare and politics. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God defending His people against overwhelming odds, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/32.htm">2 Chronicles 32</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, known for his military campaigns and attempts to conquer Jerusalem.

Tirhakah is among the most famous of the monarchs belonging to this period. The Greeks called him "Tearchon," the Assyrians "Tarku" or "Tarqu." His name, as represented on his own monuments, is "Tahark" or "Tahrak." According to the Egyptian remains, he had a reign of at least twenty-six years in Egypt - from <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>. He would seem, however, to have been King of Ethiopia, and lord paramount of the lower valley of the Nile, from about <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, Shabatok for some years ruling Egypt, or a portion of it, as his deputy (Rawlinson, 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 450). Hezekiah's negotiations had, it is probable, been with Tirhakah (ch. 19:13; 20:5; 30:1-6). This monarch, having engaged to help him, now put his forces in motion, and began to descend the Nile valley to his relief. His movement rather provoked than alarmed Sennacherib, who, having defeated one Egyptian army in <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134), was confident of success against another. <span class="cmt_word">He sent messengers</span>. It is not very clear what advantage Sennacherib expected from this second embassy. He had no fresh argument to bring forward, unless it were a suggestion that Hezekiah's God was endeavouring to deceive him.
