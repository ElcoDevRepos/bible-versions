In biblical literature, "many waters" often symbolize large groups of people or nations (<a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>). The imagery suggests tumult and unrest among the nations, reflecting the political instability and conflicts during Isaiah's time. Historically, this could refer to the Assyrian Empire's expansion, which threatened Israel and Judah. The metaphor of waters is also used in <a href="/psalms/46-3.htm">Psalm 46:3</a> to describe the power of God over the nations.<p><b>He rebukes them, and they flee far away,</b><br>God's rebuke signifies His sovereign authority over the nations. Despite their apparent strength, they are powerless against His command. This reflects the biblical theme of God's control over history and nations, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-5</a>, where God laughs at the nations' futile plans. The immediate fleeing of the nations upon God's rebuke underscores His power to protect His people and fulfill His purposes, as seen in the deliverance narratives throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>driven before the wind like chaff on the hills,</b><br>Chaff is the lightweight husk separated from grain during threshing, easily carried away by the wind. This imagery illustrates the insignificance and instability of the nations compared to God's enduring power. The metaphor of chaff is used in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> to describe the wicked, emphasizing their lack of substance and permanence. The hills, often places of threshing due to the wind, highlight the ease with which God can disperse the nations.<p><b>like tumbleweeds before a gale.</b><br>Tumbleweeds, easily uprooted and blown about, symbolize the transitory and rootless nature of the nations opposing God. This imagery reinforces the idea of divine judgment and the futility of resisting God's will. The comparison to a gale, a strong wind, emphasizes the force and inevitability of God's actions. This reflects the prophetic theme of divine retribution found throughout Isaiah, where God's judgment is portrayed as both powerful and inescapable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the nations or groups of people who are in opposition to God's will.
