In ancient Israel, the harvest was a time of joy and celebration, as it represented God's provision. The assurance that those who harvest will eat their own grain contrasts with the curses of disobedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, where others would consume the fruits of their labor. This promise reflects a return to God's favor and the restoration of justice and prosperity.<p><b>and praise the LORD</b><br>The act of eating the harvest and praising the LORD signifies gratitude and acknowledgment of God's provision. In the Old Testament, praise is often linked to recognizing God's faithfulness and blessings (<a href="/psalms/107-8.htm">Psalm 107:8-9</a>). This phrase suggests a community living in harmony with God, where their daily sustenance leads to worship and thanksgiving, fulfilling the covenant relationship.<p><b>and those who gather grapes will drink the wine</b><br>The gathering of grapes and drinking of wine is symbolic of joy and abundance. Wine is frequently associated with celebration and blessing in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). This imagery points to a time of peace and prosperity, where the people enjoy the fruits of their labor without fear of invasion or loss, contrasting with the times of judgment when vineyards were destroyed or taken by enemies (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5-7</a>).<p><b>in My holy courts.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of "My holy courts" indicates the presence of God and the centrality of worship in the life of the community. The courts refer to the temple, the place where God's presence dwelt among His people. This phrase suggests that the blessings of the harvest are not just for personal enjoyment but are to be shared in the context of worship and community. It also foreshadows the eschatological hope of dwelling in God's presence, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God dwells with His people in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvesters.htm">The Harvesters</a></b><br>These are the people who gather the grain.

The harvesters are not nameless; they are the restored inhabitants of Jerusalem, enjoying covenant blessings foretold in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-5.htm">Jeremiah 31:5</a>, &#8220;You will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters will eat them and enjoy them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This line assures Israel&#8212;and all believers who trust God&#8217;s promises&#8212;that the Lord&#8217;s oath (<a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>) protects the integrity of daily provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will eat it and praise the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Enjoyment of the harvest is tied to worship.

Previously, vineyards were trampled by armies (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>), but now the vinedressers finish their work without fear.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the grape harvest reminds us that Christ is the true vine (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>), ensuring lasting fruitfulness when we remain in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will drink the wine in My holy courts</b><p>&#8226; The scene moves from field to sanctuary.

It anticipates the ultimate banquet Isaiah already described: &#8220;The LORD of Hosts will prepare a feast of rich food&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence&#8212;labor, harvest, worship, shared meal&#8212;pictures the future fullness when God&#8217;s dwelling is permanently with His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/62-9.htm">Isaiah 62:9</a> promises a complete reversal of past losses.
