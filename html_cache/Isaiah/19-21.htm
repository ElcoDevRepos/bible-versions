The context of <a href="/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19</a> is a prophecy concerning Egypt, a significant power in the ancient Near East. The phrase suggests a future event where God will reveal His power and presence to the Egyptians, leading to a transformation in their spiritual understanding. This revelation can be seen as part of God's broader plan to extend His covenant beyond Israel, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant (see <a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>).<p><b>and on that day Egypt will acknowledge the LORD</b><br>The acknowledgment of the LORD by Egypt signifies a profound change in their religious allegiance. Historically, Egypt was known for its pantheon of gods, with Pharaoh often considered a deity. This acknowledgment implies a recognition of the LORD's supremacy over all other gods, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations (see <a href="/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a>). This transformation can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy that all nations will come to worship the one true God (see <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>).<p><b>They will worship with sacrifices and offerings</b><br>The mention of sacrifices and offerings indicates a shift to the worship practices prescribed by the LORD, reflecting a sincere devotion and repentance. In the Old Testament, sacrifices were a central aspect of worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God (see <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>). This phrase suggests that Egypt will adopt these practices, signifying their genuine conversion and commitment to the LORD. It also points to the future Messianic age when true worship will be established among all nations (see <a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>).<p><b>they will make vows to the LORD and fulfill them</b><br>Making and fulfilling vows to the LORD demonstrates a deep level of commitment and faithfulness. In biblical times, vows were solemn promises made to God, often in response to His deliverance or blessing (see <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). The fulfillment of these vows by Egypt indicates a sincere and lasting transformation, as they not only recognize the LORD but also commit to living according to His will. This reflects the biblical principle that true faith is evidenced by obedience and action (see <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reveals Himself to the Egyptians in this prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, traditionally seen as adversaries of Israel, who will come to acknowledge and worship the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices_and_offerings.htm">Sacrifices and Offerings</a></b><br>Acts of worship and devotion that the Egyptians will perform in acknowledgment of the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows.htm">Vows</a></b><br>Promises made to God, which the Egyptians will fulfill as part of their worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message, speaking God's words to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is not limited to Israel; His plan includes all nations, demonstrating His sovereignty and desire for all to know Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_revelation.htm">Transformation Through Revelation</a></b><br>The Egyptians' acknowledgment of the LORD shows the transformative power of God's revelation, leading to genuine worship and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_vows.htm">Fulfillment of Vows</a></b><br>The importance of making and fulfilling vows to God is highlighted, emphasizing integrity and faithfulness in our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_worship.htm">Universal Worship</a></b><br>This prophecy points to a future where all nations will worship God, encouraging believers to participate in global missions and evangelism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_reconciliation.htm">Hope for Reconciliation</a></b><br>The inclusion of Egypt, a former enemy, in God's plan offers hope for reconciliation and peace among all peoples.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_19_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 19:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_21_God_s_global_relationship.htm">How does Isaiah 19:21 demonstrate God's desire for relationship with all nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_LORD_known_reveal_of_God.htm">What does "the LORD will make Himself known" reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_19_21_inspire_evangelism.htm">How can Isaiah 19:21 inspire us to share the Gospel with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Life_sacrifices_mirroring_Isaiah_19_21_vows.htm">What sacrifices in our lives reflect the "vows" mentioned in Isaiah 19:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_21_Matthew_28_19-20_link.htm">How does Isaiah 19:21 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_21_God_s_future_for_Egypt.htm">How does Isaiah 19:21 reflect God's plan for Egypt's future?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_reveal_to_Egyptians_in_Isaiah_19_21.htm">Why does God choose to reveal Himself to the Egyptians in Isaiah 19:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Which_events_does_Isaiah_19_21_cite.htm">What historical events might Isaiah 19:21 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_god_fearsome_in_exodus_19.htm">Why is God depicted as a physical, fearsome presence in Exodus 19, but more abstractly and intimately in other biblical passages?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_rahab_and_babylon_belong_to_zion.htm">Psalm 87:4 &#8211; How can Rahab (often associated with Egypt) and Babylon both be said to belong to Zion if they were historically distinct cultures?

Did the prophet, we ask, think of such sacrifices as literally offered in Egypt, or did he look beyond the symbol to the thing symbolised? The builders of the temple at Leontopolis took the former view. Those who have entered into the mind and spirit of Isaiah will be inclined, perhaps, to take the latter. A literal fulfilment has been found in the fact that Ptolemy Euergetes (B.C. 244) came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall be known</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall make himself known</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5, 9</a>; by answering prayer, by spiritual influences, and the like. <span class="cmt_word">The Egyptians shall know the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, "They shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall do sacrifice and oblation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall serve with sacrifice and oblation</span>.
