In the context of Isaiah, the "opened ears" suggest a readiness to hear and obey God's commands. This is reminiscent of the servant songs in Isaiah, where the servant is depicted as obedient and attentive to God's will. The opening of ears can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual awakening or enlightenment, similar to how Jesus often spoke of those who have ears to hear (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, having one's ears opened by a deity was a sign of being chosen or commissioned for a special task.<p><b>and I have not been rebellious</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the servant's obedience and submission to God's will. In the broader narrative of Isaiah, Israel is often depicted as rebellious, contrasting with the faithful servant who remains obedient. This obedience is a key characteristic of the servant, who is often seen as a type of Christ. Jesus exemplified perfect obedience to the Father, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death. The servant's lack of rebellion underscores the ideal response to God's call, contrasting with the disobedience of the people of Israel.<p><b>nor have I turned back</b><br>This phrase emphasizes perseverance and steadfastness in following God's path. The servant remains committed to the mission, despite challenges or opposition. This steadfastness is a hallmark of the faithful servant and is mirrored in the life of Jesus, who set His face toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>) and did not turn back from His mission, even in the face of suffering and death. The imagery of not turning back is also found in the call to discipleship, where Jesus instructs His followers to take up their cross and follow Him without looking back (<a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>). This commitment is essential for fulfilling God's purposes and is a model for believers to emulate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who communicates His will and guidance to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Often interpreted as the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills the role of the obedient servant in Isaiah's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His messages to the people of Israel, including the Servant Songs, which point to the coming Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Isaiah prophesied, often depicted as rebellious and in need of redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Isaiah's prophecies, where Israel faced judgment and exile due to their disobedience, yet with promises of future restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_voice.htm">Obedience to God's Voice</a></b><br>Just as the Servant's ears were opened by God, we must be attentive to God's voice in our lives, seeking His guidance through prayer and Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_model_of_christ's_obedience.htm">The Model of Christ's Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus, as the ultimate Servant, exemplifies perfect obedience.

Like Samuel&#8217;s &#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>), the phrase pictures a willing learner whose ears have been unstopped so he can receive every word.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a> echoes the same posture: &#8220;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened.&#8221; True worship starts with attentive hearing before any action is taken.<p>&#8226; This listening heart perfectly characterizes Christ. He said, &#8220;I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). His constant communion with the Father (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>) models the listening life believers are called to imitate (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have not been rebellious</b><p>&#8226; Having heard, the Servant obeys without hesitation: &#8220;I have not been rebellious.&#8221; Israel had repeatedly resisted God (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>), but the true Servant stands in stark contrast.<p>&#8226; Jesus fulfills this line completely. &#8220;I always do what pleases Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>). <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> declares Him &#8220;without sin,&#8221; and <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a> points to His obedience &#8220;to death&#8212;even death on a cross.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For those united to Him, obedience is the expected outflow of genuine hearing (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>, <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). His spotless record empowers believers to pursue the same single-hearted loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor have I turned back</b><p>&#8226; Obedience endures: &#8220;nor have I turned back.&#8221; The Servant refuses to retreat even when His path leads through suffering. Isaiah immediately adds, &#8220;I offered My back to those who struck Me&#8221; (50:6).<p>&#8226; Jesus &#8220;set His face like flint&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>) and &#8220;resolutely set out for Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), refusing the easier road. In Gethsemane He affirmed, &#8220;Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2-3</a> calls believers to the same perseverance, fixing our eyes on the One who &#8220;endured the cross&#8221; and &#8220;did not grow weary or lose heart.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/50-5.htm">Isaiah 50:5</a> portrays the ideal Servant&#8212;ultimately Jesus&#8212;whose ears are opened by the Father, whose will is entirely free of rebellion, and whose course never reverses.

The Servant continues his soliloquy. What has come to him in the morning communings with God is, as in the next verse, that he too is to bear reproach and shame, as other disciples had done before him. The writer of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm" title="All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,">Psalm 22:7</a>, the much-enduring Job (<a href="/job/30-10.htm" title="They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.">Job 30:10</a>), the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>), were but foreshadowings of the sufferings that should fall on him. And all this the true Servant-Scholar accepts willingly. because it is his Father's will. Here again we cannot fail to trace the influence of Isaiah's words in all our Lord's utterances as to His passion. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="/mark/10-34.htm" title="And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Mark 10:34</a>; <a href="/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath opened mine ear</span>. Some understand this of the boring of the ear for perpetual service (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>); but it is perhaps better to regard it as intended to mark a contrast between the true Servant and the professed servants, or children of Israel. They "did not hear; their ear was <span class="accented">not</span> opened; they were treacherous and rebellious from the womb" (<a href="/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). His ear was opened to receive God's word perpetually; he was not rebellious, did not turn away back.
