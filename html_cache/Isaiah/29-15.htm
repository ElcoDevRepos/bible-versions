The act of "digging deep" suggests a deliberate and determined effort to conceal intentions, indicating a profound level of deceit and rebellion against God. In the biblical context, this reflects the actions of the leaders of Judah who sought alliances with foreign nations, such as Egypt, rather than trusting in God (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). Theologically, it underscores the futility of attempting to hide anything from an omniscient God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges that nothing is hidden from God's sight. This phrase also echoes the deceit of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, who attempted to hide from God after their disobedience.<p><b>In darkness they do their works</b><br>The reference to "darkness" symbolizes evil, ignorance, and the absence of God's truth. Biblically, darkness is often associated with sin and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The works done in darkness imply actions that are morally corrupt and intended to be hidden from others. This reflects the cultural and historical context of secretive political maneuvers and idolatrous practices that were prevalent in ancient Judah. Theologically, it contrasts with the call for believers to walk in the light, as children of light (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-11</a>), and serves as a warning against living a life of hypocrisy and hidden sin.<p><b>and say, &#8220;Who sees us, and who will know?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question reveals the arrogance and self-deception of those who believe they can act without accountability. It reflects a denial of God's omnipresence and omniscience, similar to the attitude of the wicked described in <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>, who think God has forgotten and does not see. Historically, this attitude was prevalent among the leaders of Judah who believed their secret plans would not be discovered. Theologically, it serves as a reminder that God sees all actions and knows all thoughts (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where all hidden things will be brought to light (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>), emphasizing the need for integrity and transparency before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

The allusion is to the schemes which were afloat for calling in the aid of Egypt.
