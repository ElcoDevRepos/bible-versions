Historically, this period was marked by social injustice, idolatry, and a departure from the covenantal laws given to Israel. The use of "stumbled" and "fallen" suggests not just a temporary misstep but a profound collapse in their relationship with God. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>, where Jerusalem's sin leads to its downfall. The fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC to the Babylonians is a historical fulfillment of this prophetic warning.<p><b>because they spoke and acted against the LORD</b><br>The people's rebellion is both verbal and behavioral, indicating a comprehensive rejection of God's authority. Speaking against the LORD could involve blasphemy, false prophecy, or the promotion of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>. Acting against the LORD includes the violation of His commandments, such as those outlined in the Mosaic Law. This rebellion is reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness, as described in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>, where their complaints and actions demonstrated a lack of faith and trust in God.<p><b>defying His glorious presence</b><br>The phrase "His glorious presence" refers to the Shekinah glory, the manifest presence of God that dwelt in the Temple in Jerusalem. Defying this presence implies a direct affront to God's holiness and sovereignty. This defiance can be seen in the neglect of temple worship and the embrace of pagan practices, as condemned by prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6-18</a>). Theologically, this defiance is a rejection of God's kingship, paralleling the rejection of Jesus Christ, who is described as the fullness of God's glory in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. The ultimate consequence of such defiance is separation from God, as seen in the exile of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, representing the spiritual and political center of the Jewish people.
