The term "Servant" is often understood as a reference to the Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The concept of prosperity here is not limited to material success but encompasses the fulfillment of God's purposes. The Servant's prosperity is seen in His successful mission to redeem humanity. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's chosen individuals, like Joseph and David, prosper in fulfilling divine purposes despite adversity.<p><b>He will be raised and lifted up</b><br>This phrase suggests both a physical and metaphorical elevation. In the context of Isaiah, it foreshadows the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, as understood in the New Testament. The language of being "raised" and "lifted up" is reminiscent of the crucifixion, where Jesus was literally lifted on the cross, and His subsequent resurrection and ascension into heaven. This duality of suffering and exaltation is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing the paradox of the Messiah's path to glory through suffering.<p><b>and highly exalted.</b><br>The exaltation of the Servant signifies His ultimate victory and divine approval. In the New Testament, this is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where Jesus is exalted by God and given the name above every name. The cultural context of exaltation in ancient Near Eastern societies often involved public recognition and honor, which parallels the Christian belief in Jesus' ultimate reign and recognition as Lord by all creation. This exaltation is not only a future event but also a present reality for believers who acknowledge Jesus' lordship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This refers to the "Servant of the Lord," a prophetic figure in Isaiah, often understood by conservative Christians as a reference to Jesus Christ.

The whole must be treated as an entirely distinct section (all the more striking, from its contrast to the triumphant tone of what precedes it), and finds its only adequate explanation in the thought of a new revelation made to the prophet's mind. That may have had, like other revelations, a starting-point in the prophet's own experience. He had seen partially good kings, like Uzziah and Jotham; one who almost realised his ideal of what a king should be, in Hezekiah. None of these had redeemed or regenerated the people. So far as that work had been done at all, it had been through prophets who spake the word of the Lord and were mocked and persecuted because they spake it. Something like a law was dawning upon his mind, and that law was the power of a vicarious suffering, the might of martyrdom in life and death. Did it not follow from this that that ideal must be wrought out on a yet wider scale in the great work of restoration to which he was looking forward? The Servant of the Lord, in all the concentric developments of the thought which the word implied, the nation, the prophetic kernel of the nation, the individual Servant identifying himself with both, must himself also be made perfect through suffering and conquer through apparent failure. Granting that such a law exists, it will be no wonder that we should find examples of its working both before and after the great fulfilment, in Isaiah himself, in Jeremiah, in the exiles of the captivity, in the heroes of the Maccabean struggle, in the saints and martyrs of the Church of Christ. It remains true that the Christ alone fulfils the idea of the perfect sufferer, as He alone fulfils that of the perfect King. Measuring Isaiah from a purely human stand-point, and by the standard of other poets, this manifold symbolism of "the Servant," will hardly seem strange to the student of literature who remembers the many aspects presented by the Beatrice of Dante, the St. George and Gloriana of Spenser, the Piers Plowman of Langland.<p><span class= "bld">Shall deal prudently.</span>--The words imply, as in <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm" title="This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm" title="For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.">Jeremiah 10:21</a>, the idea of prospering.

It is generally allowed by modern commentators that this passage is more closely connected with what follows it than with what precedes. Some would detach it altogether from ch. 52. and attach it to ch. 53. But this is not necessary. The passage has a completeness in itself. It is a connecting link. The exaltation of Israel, the collective "Servant of the Lord" (<a href="/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 21</a>), brings to the prophet's mind the exaltation of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), through which alone the full exaltation of Israel is possible. He is bound to complete his account of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> by telling of <span class="accented">his</span> exaltation, and of the road which led to it. This is done in ch. 53, in what has been called the "<span class="accented">Great Passional."</span> But the "<span class="accented">Great</span> Pas-signal" needs a "<span class="accented">prelude</span>," an "introduction," if only as indicative' of its greatness.
