In ancient cities, gates were closed to protect against invaders, so open gates symbolize safety and prosperity. This imagery is often associated with the Messianic age, where Christ's reign brings ultimate peace. <a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a> echoes this vision of the New Jerusalem, where the gates are never shut, indicating eternal security and divine presence.<p><b>they will never be shut, day or night,</b><br>The perpetual openness of the gates suggests continuous access and unending opportunity for worship and fellowship with God. It reflects the idea of God's kingdom being accessible to all who seek Him, without restriction. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the promise of God's eternal covenant with His people, where His presence is constant and His blessings are unceasing.<p><b>so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you,</b><br>This phrase indicates the influx of resources and treasures from other nations, symbolizing the recognition of God's sovereignty and the honoring of His people. Historically, this reflects the tribute brought to Israel during times of prosperity, but prophetically, it points to the gathering of all nations to worship God, as seen in passages like <a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, where the "desired of all nations" will come.<p><b>with their kings being led in procession.</b><br>The image of kings being led in procession suggests a voluntary submission to God's rule and the acknowledgment of His supreme authority. It reflects the fulfillment of prophecies where nations and their leaders recognize the God of Israel as the true God. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory and reign, where every knee will bow, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, representing the people of Israel and, by extension, the future Kingdom of God.
