In the prophetic books, such declarations often serve as a prelude to divine judgment or instruction. The use of "The LORD" (Yahweh) underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting the gravity of their transgressions.<p><b>Because the daughters of Zion are haughty&#8212;</b><br>"Daughters of Zion" refers to the women of Jerusalem, representing the people of Israel. The term "haughty" indicates pride and arrogance, which are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This pride is not just personal but reflects a broader societal decay, as seen in the context of Isaiah's prophecies against Judah and Jerusalem. The pride of the people is often linked to their spiritual unfaithfulness and neglect of God's commandments.<p><b>walking with heads held high and wanton eyes,</b><br>This imagery suggests a demeanor of arrogance and flirtation. "Heads held high" symbolizes self-importance and disdain for others, while "wanton eyes" implies seductive or flirtatious glances. Such behavior reflects a departure from the modesty and humility expected of God's people (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on modesty, and this description indicates a moral and spiritual decline.<p><b>prancing and skipping as they go,</b><br>The actions of "prancing and skipping" convey a sense of frivolity and carelessness. This behavior contrasts with the sober and reverent conduct expected of those who follow God. It suggests a focus on outward appearance and self-indulgence rather than inner piety and devotion. The prophets often criticized Israel for prioritizing external displays over genuine faithfulness (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>).<p><b>jingling the bracelets on their ankles&#8212;</b><br>The mention of "bracelets on their ankles" highlights the emphasis on adornment and external beauty. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such jewelry was often associated with wealth and status. The jingling sound draws attention to the wearer, symbolizing a desire for recognition and admiration. This focus on materialism and vanity is condemned in Scripture, as it distracts from the worship of God and the pursuit of righteousness (<a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_zion.htm">Daughters of Zion</a></b><br>Refers to the women of Jerusalem, representing the people of Judah, who are being addressed for their prideful behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of judgment and correction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem/zion.htm">Jerusalem/Zion</a></b><br>The city of God, representing the spiritual and political center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event of divine correction and discipline that God is pronouncing upon His people for their sinful behavior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride is a serious sin that leads to God's judgment.

Just as in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>, &#8220;The LORD has spoken,&#8221; or in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a> where Jesus declares, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone&#8230; but on every word that comes from the mouth of God,&#8221; the prophet is simply the messenger; God Himself is addressing His covenant people. Because God speaks, obedience is not optional, and what He diagnoses must be taken seriously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the daughters of Zion are haughty</b><p>Pride lies at the root of the indictment. These &#8220;daughters&#8221; represent the women of Jerusalem, yet by extension the entire nation sharing the same heart attitude. Scripture consistently warns that &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) and that &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). Rather than reflecting the humility required by <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, their self-exaltation sets them on a collision course with divine discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>walking with heads held high</b><p>The posture is literal&#8212;heads tilted back in self-importance&#8212;and symbolic of an inner arrogance God must confront. Isaiah has already declared, &#8220;The haughty eyes of man will be humbled&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>). <a href="/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a> models the opposite spirit: &#8220;My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty.&#8221; God notices not only deeds but demeanor; even body language can reveal a heart estranged from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wanton eyes</b><p>Their gaze is flirtatious and suggestive, aimed at drawing attention. Jesus later warns, &#8220;Everyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>). Here the women themselves deploy the look, embodying &#8220;the lust of the eyes&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). God calls His people to purity of sight and motive (<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>prancing and skipping as they go</b><p>The phrase pictures exaggerated, seductive steps&#8212;public display for selfish gain. Paul urges believers to &#8220;walk circumspectly, not as unwise but as wise&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>), and Peter counsels, &#8220;your behavior should be holy&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15</a>). The carefree, provocative gait of these women contradicts the sober, modest walk expected of the holy city (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>jingling the bracelets on their ankles</b><p>Their ankle jewelry broadcasts wealth and invites attention, turning worship of God into worship of self. Peter addresses similar vanity: &#8220;Your adornment should not be outward&#8230; but the hidden person of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>). <a href="/revelation/18-16.htm">Revelation 18:16</a> laments Babylon&#8217;s adornment&#8212;gold, jewels, and pearls&#8212;before her sudden downfall. God is not against beauty; He is against ostentatious display that feeds pride and distracts from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a> exposes a cascade of outward actions rooted in inward pride. God sees:<p>&#8226; the source&#8212;haughty hearts<p>&#8226; the signs&#8212;raised heads, seductive eyes, showy steps, jingling ornaments<p>&#8226; the sentence&#8212;soon-to-follow judgment (detailed in <a href="/isaiah/3-17.htm">Isaiah 3:17-26</a>)<p>He calls His people to humility, modesty, and wholehearted devotion, assuring us that our posture, gaze, walk, and adornment all matter because they reflect the state of our hearts before the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Because the daughters of Zion . . .</span>--From the princes that worked evil, Isaiah turns to their wives, sisters, concubines, who were showing themselves degenerate daughters of Sarah and Rebecca. A like denunciation meets us in <a href="/context/isaiah/32-9.htm" title="Rise up, you women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear to my speech.">Isaiah 32:9-12</a>, but this is without a parallel in the minuteness of its detail. It is as though the prophet had gone into the boudoir of one of the leaders of the fashions of Jerusalem, and taken an inventory of what he found there. Possibly we may trace the influence of the prophetess-wife of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm" title="And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>), seeking to recall those of her own sex to a higher life. We note, on a smaller scale, a like teaching in the married apostle (<a href="/context/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1Peter 3:3-4</a>). Twenty-one distinct articles are mentioned. Their names for the most part appear to have a foreign stamp on them. Then, as at other times, luxury imported its novelties, and the women of Judah took up the fashions of those of Tyre or Damascus or Philistia. It is not without interest to compare the protests of Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span>), Dante (<span class= "ital">Purgat. </span>xxiii. 106-111), Chrysostom, and Savonarola against like evils.<p><span class= "bld">With stretched forth necks </span>. . .--The corruption which the prophet paints showed itself then, as it has done in later times, in the adoption by the decent classes of society of the gait and glances of the harlots of alien birth (comp. <a href="/context/proverbs/7-9.htm" title="In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:">Proverbs 7:9-21</a>), with, perhaps, the difference of a certain affectation of coyness.<p><span class= "bld">Making a tinkling with their feet.</span>--Small silver bells were fastened on the ankles, and so the beauties of Jerusalem carried, as it were, their music with them.
