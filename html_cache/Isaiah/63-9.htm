It reflects the deep connection between God and Israel, where their suffering becomes His own. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is described as a High Priest who sympathizes with our weaknesses (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). The idea of God being afflicted alongside His people can also be seen in the narrative of the Exodus, where God hears the cries of the Israelites and is moved to act on their behalf (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>).<p><b>and the Angel of His Presence saved them</b><br>The "Angel of His Presence" is often understood as a theophany, a manifestation of God Himself, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This angel is not merely a messenger but represents God's immediate presence and power. In <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>, God promises to send an angel to guard and lead the Israelites, which is seen as a direct intervention of God in their deliverance. This angelic figure is also associated with the divine presence in the wilderness, guiding and protecting the Israelites.<p><b>In His love and compassion He redeemed them</b><br>God's actions are motivated by His love and compassion, central attributes of His character. Redemption here refers to the deliverance from bondage, particularly the Exodus from Egypt, which is a foundational event in Israel's history. This act of redemption is a type of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The language of love and compassion underscores the personal and relational nature of God's salvation.<p><b>He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old</b><br>This imagery of God lifting and carrying His people evokes the care and protection He provided throughout their history, especially during the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> describes God carrying Israel as a father carries his son, emphasizing His nurturing and sustaining role. This phrase also points to God's faithfulness and enduring commitment to His covenant people, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament and finds its fulfillment in the New Testament through Christ's sacrificial love and ongoing intercession for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often experiencing distress and needing deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_his_presence.htm">The Angel of His Presence</a></b><br>A divine figure representing God's immediate presence and intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_love_and_compassion.htm">God's Love and Compassion</a></b><br>Attributes of God that motivate His actions towards His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The act of God saving His people from their afflictions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_days_of_old.htm">The Days of Old</a></b><br>Refers to the historical acts of God in delivering Israel, such as the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_empathy_with_our_suffering.htm">God's Empathy with Our Suffering</a></b><br>God is not distant in our distress; He shares in our afflictions, demonstrating His deep empathy and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_presence.htm">The Role of Divine Presence</a></b><br>The "Angel of His Presence" signifies God's active involvement in our lives, offering guidance and salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_motivation_of_love_and_compassion.htm">The Motivation of Love and Compassion</a></b><br>God's actions are driven by His love and compassion, reminding us of His unwavering commitment to our well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_faithfulness_as_a_foundation_for_trust.htm">Historical Faithfulness as a Foundation for Trust</a></b><br>Reflecting on "the days of old" encourages us to trust in God's consistent faithfulness throughout history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_as_a_continuous_process.htm">Redemption as a Continuous Process</a></b><br>God's redemption is not a one-time event but a continuous process of lifting and carrying us through life's challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_63_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 63:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_63_9_God_s_compassion_in_trials.htm">How does Isaiah 63:9 demonstrate God's compassion and presence in our struggles?

It became an intense oppression, when the king "arose who knew not Joseph" (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>). God's sympathy with Israel's sufferings at this time is strongly marked in the narrative of Exodus (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7, 17</a>). An alternative reading of the Hebrew text gives the sense, "In all their affliction he was not an adversary;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he did not afflict them for their hurt, but for their benefit. But the reading followed by our translators, and most moderns, is to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">The angel of his presence saved them</span>. "The angel of his presence" occurs nowhere but in this place. It is probably equivalent to "the angel of God" (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>), or "the angel of the Lord" (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>; <a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>, etc.), and designates either the Second Person of the Trinity, or the highest of the angelic company, who seems to be the archangel Michael (see Pussy's 'Daniel,' pp. 525, 526). (For the angelic interpositions which "saved" Israel, see <a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-23</a>; <a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">In his love and in his pity he</span> <span class="cmt_word">redeemed them</span>.
