In the context of <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>, the prophet is highlighting the incomparable nature of God, contrasting Him with the idols and false gods of the surrounding nations. The rhetorical question underscores that God requires no counsel or advice from any being, as He is the source of all wisdom and knowledge. This aligns with <a href="/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>, where it is stated that no one can teach God knowledge. It also reflects the creation narrative in Genesis, where God alone speaks the universe into existence without assistance.<p><b>and who taught Him the paths of justice?</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's inherent understanding of justice. In the ancient Near Eastern context, justice was a central theme, often associated with the role of kings and deities. Unlike human rulers who might need advisors or legal experts, God embodies perfect justice and righteousness. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>, which describes righteousness and justice as the foundation of God's throne. The phrase also foreshadows the messianic role of Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the ultimate judge and king in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>.<p><b>Who imparted knowledge to Him</b><br>This question further asserts God's self-sufficiency and the completeness of His wisdom. In the cultural context of Isaiah's time, wisdom was highly valued and often associated with age and experience. However, God's wisdom is eternal and unbounded, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, which states that the Lord gives wisdom. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Christ is described as the embodiment of divine wisdom in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<p><b>and showed Him the way of understanding?</b><br>The final phrase reinforces the theme of God's unparalleled understanding. In biblical literature, understanding is often linked with discernment and insight into the true nature of things. God's understanding is perfect and comprehensive, as affirmed in <a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>, which declares that His understanding is infinite. This concept is also reflected in the life of Jesus, who demonstrated divine understanding in His teachings and interactions, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-47.htm">Luke 2:47</a>, where even as a child, He amazed the teachers with His understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, highlighting His omniscience and sovereignty.

Or who has been His counselor?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34-36</a>).<p>The point is clear&#8212;God possesses perfect, self-existent wisdom. He never needs advice, input, or collaboration. This assures us that His plans cannot be thwarted, His promises cannot fail, and His Word is utterly trustworthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and who taught Him the paths of justice</b><p>&#8220;Who taught Him the paths of justice?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>).
