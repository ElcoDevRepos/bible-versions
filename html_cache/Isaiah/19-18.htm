In the context of Isaiah, it points to a time when God's plans for judgment and redemption will be realized. It suggests a significant shift in the spiritual landscape, particularly concerning Egypt.<p><b>five cities in the land of Egypt</b><br>The number five may symbolize completeness or a significant portion of Egypt, indicating a widespread change. Egypt, historically a powerful nation and often an adversary of Israel, is depicted here as undergoing a transformation. This prophecy suggests a future where parts of Egypt will turn towards the God of Israel, indicating a shift from their traditional polytheistic beliefs.<p><b>will speak the language of Canaan</b><br>The language of Canaan refers to Hebrew, the language of the Israelites. This implies a cultural and religious shift, as adopting a language often signifies adopting the associated culture and beliefs. It suggests that these Egyptian cities will embrace the faith and practices of the Israelites, symbolizing a turning away from their own gods.<p><b>and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts</b><br>Swearing allegiance indicates a formal commitment or covenant. The LORD of Hosts is a title emphasizing God's sovereignty and power over all armies, both heavenly and earthly. This phrase suggests a profound conversion experience, where these cities recognize and submit to the authority of the God of Israel, forsaking their previous allegiances.<p><b>One of them will be called the City of the Sun</b><br>The City of the Sun likely refers to Heliopolis, a major center of sun worship in ancient Egypt. The transformation of such a city into one that honors the LORD signifies a dramatic change, as it represents the turning of a place known for idolatry into one that acknowledges the true God. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the light of the world, bringing truth and redemption to places of spiritual darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and idolatry.

Not really the day of vengeance, but that which, in the prophet's mind, is most closely connected with it - the day of restitution - whereof he has spoken perpetually (<a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25-27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>, etc.). The two are parts of one scheme of things, and belong in the prophet's mind to one time. <span class="cmt_word">Shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan</span>. It is quite true, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, that the Eastern Delta was from a very early date continually more and more Semitized by an influx of settlers from Palestine, and that Egyptian literature bears strong marks of this linguistic influence. But this is scarcely what the prophet intends to speak about. He is not interested in philology. What he means is that there will be an appreciable influx into Egypt of Palestinian ideas, thoughts, and sentiments. "Five" is probably used as a "round" number. The first manifest fulfillment of the prophecy was at the foundation of Alexandria, when the Jews were encouraged to become settlers by the concession of important privileges (Josephus, 'Contr. Ap.,' 2:4), and where they ultimately became the predominant element in the population, amounting, according to Philo ('In Flaec.,' &sect; 6), to nearly a million souls. The next great Palestinian influx was under Ptolemy YI. (Philometor), when Onias fled from Palestine with a number of his partisans, and obtained permission to erect a Jewish temple near Heliopelis. The site of this temple is probably marked by the ruins at Tel-el-Yahoudeh ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for July, 1880, pp. 137-139). It seems to have been a center to a number of Jewish communities in the neighborhood. In this double way Jehovah became known to Egypt before Christianity. A Christian Church was early established in Alexandria, possibly by St. Mark. <span class="cmt_word">Swear to the Lord of hosts</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "swear fidelity to him." <span class="cmt_word">One shall be called, The city of destruction</span>. Some manuscripts read '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-Kheres</span>, "City of the Sun," for '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span>, "City of Destruction," in which case the reference would be plainly to Heliopelis, which was in the immediate neighborhood of Tel-el-Yahoudeh, and which in the Ptolemaic period may well have fallen under Jewish influence. Even <span class="accented">if </span> '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span> stand as the true reading, the name may still have been given with allusion to Heliopolis, the prophet intending to say, "That city which was known as the City of the Sun-God shall become known as the City of Destruction of the Sun-God and of idolatrous worship generally." That Heliopolis did actually fall under Jewish influence in the Ptolemaic period appears from a remarkable passage of Polyhistor, who says of the Exodus and the passage of the Red Sea, "The Memphites say that Moses, being well acquainted with the district, watched the ebb of the tide, and so led the people across the dry bed of the sea; but <span class="accented">they of Heliopolis</span> affirm that the king, at the head of a vast force, and having the sacred animals also with him, pursued after the Jews, because they were carrying away with them the riches which they had borrowed from the Egyptians. Then, "<span class="accented">they say</span>," the voice of God commanded Moses to smite the sea with his rod, and divide it; and Moses, when he heard, touched the water with it, and so the sea parted asunder, and the host marched through on dry ground." Such an account of the Exodus would scarcely have been given by Egyptians unless they were three parts Hebraized. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/19-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1441;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
