It is a common prophetic formula that signals the importance of the message that follows. The use of "Lord GOD" underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting His role as both ruler and redeemer.<p><b>At first My people went down to Egypt to live:</b><br>This refers to the initial migration of the Israelites to Egypt during the time of Joseph, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>. The phrase "to live" indicates that their move was originally for survival and prosperity during a famine. Egypt, a powerful and fertile land, provided refuge and sustenance. This historical context sets the stage for understanding Israel's later enslavement and God's deliverance through the Exodus, a foundational event in Israelite identity and faith.<p><b>then Assyria oppressed them without cause:</b><br>The mention of Assyria reflects a later period in Israel's history when the Assyrian Empire became a dominant force in the Near East. The phrase "oppressed them without cause" suggests unjust aggression and exploitation. Historically, Assyria was known for its military might and harsh treatment of conquered peoples, including the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which fell in 722 BC. This oppression is seen as part of God's disciplinary measures but also as an act of injustice that God would ultimately address. The reference to Assyria also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use them for His purposes, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Nahum.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history where the Israelites initially went to reside during a famine and later became enslaved.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its military might and oppression of Israel, representing a period of suffering for God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_people.htm">My people</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who experienced oppression and deliverance throughout their history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, through whom God communicated His messages to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_history.htm">God's Sovereignty Over History</a></b><br>God is in control of the nations and uses historical events to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_oppression.htm">The Reality of Oppression</a></b><br>God's people have faced oppression throughout history, yet God remains their deliverer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Trust in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as God delivered Israel from Egypt and Assyria, He is faithful to deliver us from our own trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembering_history.htm">The Importance of Remembering History</a></b><br>Reflecting on past deliverances strengthens our faith and trust in God's future promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_righteousness.htm">God's Justice and Righteousness</a></b><br>God sees the unjust oppression of His people and will act in His perfect timing to bring justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_52_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 52:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_52_4_God_s_deliverance_theme.htm">How does Isaiah 52:4 highlight God's deliverance from oppression in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_52_4_Israel_s_past_events.htm">What historical events are referenced in Isaiah 52:4 regarding Israel's past?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_52_4_Trust_in_God_s_sovereignty.htm">How can Isaiah 52:4 inspire trust in God's sovereignty over unjust situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Both_highlight_Israel_s_oppression_in_Egypt.htm">Connect Isaiah 52:4 with Exodus 1:11.

It is possible that Assyria may be used in its wider sense as including Babylon. If so, the fact tends to the conclusion that the book was written at a time when the kings of Assyria included Babylon in their titles. Probably, however, the prophet refers to the deliverance from the army of Sennacherib as a pledge of the deliverance from Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My people went down... into Egypt ... the Assyrian oppressed them</span>. Israel had experienced three captivities.

They (or a great part of them) were violently carried into captivity by the Assyrian kings, Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>), Sargon (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), and Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; 'Eponym Canon,' p. 134), who, without cause, grievously "oppressed" them.
