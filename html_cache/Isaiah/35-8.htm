In the ancient Near East, highways were often constructed for the passage of kings and armies, symbolizing authority and purpose. The "Way of Holiness" signifies a path set apart for God's people, emphasizing purity and dedication to the Lord. This concept aligns with the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God's people are called to be distinct and set apart (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The highway metaphor also connects to <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where a voice cries out to prepare the way for the Lord, indicating a messianic expectation fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>The unclean will not travel it&#8212;</b><br>In the context of Isaiah, "unclean" refers to those who are ritually impure or morally defiled, unable to approach God's holy presence. This exclusion underscores the necessity of spiritual purity and righteousness to walk on this divine path. The Old Testament law provided detailed instructions on cleanliness, symbolizing the separation from sin required to commune with God (Leviticus 11-15). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which cleanses believers from sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<p><b>only those who walk in the Way&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the exclusivity of the path to those who live according to God's commandments. Walking in "the Way" implies a lifestyle of obedience and faithfulness, reminiscent of the early Christian community, which was known as "the Way" (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>). It suggests a journey of discipleship, where believers follow the teachings and example of Jesus, the ultimate embodiment of the Way.<p><b>and fools will not stray onto it.</b><br>In biblical literature, "fools" often denote those who reject wisdom and live contrary to God's will (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This phrase assures that those who lack spiritual discernment and reject God's truth will not inadvertently find themselves on this holy path. It emphasizes the intentionality required to pursue righteousness and the guidance of the Holy Spirit in leading believers on the path of life (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The assurance that fools will not stray onto it underscores the divine protection and guidance for those who earnestly seek God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/highway.htm">Highway</a></b><br>Symbolic of a path or journey, representing a way of life that leads to holiness and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/way_of_holiness.htm">Way of Holiness</a></b><br>A metaphorical path that signifies living according to God's standards and being set apart for His purposes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean.htm">The Unclean</a></b><br>Refers to those who are not in right standing with God, often associated with sin and impurity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_walk_in_that_way.htm">Those Who Walk in that Way</a></b><br>Represents the faithful followers of God who live according to His commandments and seek holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fools.htm">Fools</a></b><br>In biblical terms, often refers to those who reject wisdom and understanding, particularly the wisdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to walk on the Way of Holiness, living lives that are set apart for God and reflecting His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusivity_of_the_path.htm">Exclusivity of the Path</a></b><br>The Way of Holiness is exclusive to those who are cleansed by God and committed to His ways.

(See <a href="/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a>.) We are still in the region of parables, but the thought has a special interest as a transition, at the close of the first volume of Isaiah's writings, to the opening of the second. The use of the road has been referred, by some interpreters, to the return of the exiles from Babylon. Rather is it the road by which the pilgrims of all nations shall journey to the mountain of the Lord's house (<a href="/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The way of holiness . . .</span>--The name of the road confirms the interpretation just given. There was to be a true <span class= "ital">Via Sacra </span>to the earthly temple, as the type of that eternal Temple, not made with hands, which also was in the prophet's thoughts. Along that road there would be no barbarous invaders polluting the ground they trod, no Jews ceremonially or spiritually unclean. The picture of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>) into which "there entereth nothing that defileth," presents a like feature. <span class= "ital">It shall be for them, i.e.<span class= "bld"> . .</span> .</span> <span class= "ital">It is appointed for those, for whosoever walketh therein </span>(the Hebrew verb is in the singular). Then, in strict order, comes the final clause: <span class= "ital">Even the simple ones shall not lose their way. </span>A curious parallel is found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm" title="The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>, where "he knoweth not how to go to the city," is one of the notes of the man who is void of understanding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an highway shall be there, and a way</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>).
