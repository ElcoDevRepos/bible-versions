The altars represent human attempts to create objects of worship, often in defiance of God's commandments. In the historical context, Israel and Judah frequently fell into idol worship, influenced by surrounding nations. The altars symbolize self-reliance and disobedience, as they are crafted by human hands rather than ordained by God. This turning away signifies repentance and a return to worshiping the true God, aligning with the prophetic call to abandon false gods.<p><b>or to the Asherahs and incense altars they have made with their fingers</b><br>Asherahs were wooden symbols or poles associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often placed near altars dedicated to Baal. The mention of Asherahs highlights the syncretism that plagued Israel, as they adopted pagan practices. Incense altars were used in idol worship, contrasting with the incense offerings prescribed in the Mosaic Law for the worship of Yahweh. The phrase underscores the futility of idolatry, as these objects are crafted by human fingers, emphasizing their impotence compared to the living God. This turning away from Asherahs and incense altars is a prophetic call to purity and exclusive devotion to God, resonating with the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for a holy and faithful people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often criticized by prophets for idolatry and turning away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, also warned by prophets, though it had periods of reform.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often set up beside altars.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built for offering sacrifices, which in this context, were made for idols rather than the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, who conveyed God's messages to Israel and Judah, warning them of judgment and calling them to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry's_futility.htm">Idolatry's Futility</a></b><br>Idolatry is ultimately futile because it involves worshiping what is created rather than the Creator.

The Assyrian "sacred tree" was most likely an emblem of the same kind, and may give an idea of the sort of object worshipped under the name of Asherah (comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 235-237). The Israelites, in the time of their prosperity, had set up "groves" of this character "on every high hill, and under every green tree" (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>). Many of them were still standing when Josiah made his iconoclastic raid into the Israelite country (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5-7</a>), and were broken down by him at the same time as the altars. The "images" of this place are the same as those coupled with the Israelite "groves" in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-7.htm">2 Chronicles 34:7</a>, namely "sun-images," emblems of Baal, probably pillars or conical stones, such as are known to have held a place in the religious worship of Phoenicia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
