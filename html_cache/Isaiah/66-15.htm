Fire is often associated with God's presence and judgment in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> with the burning bush and in <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a> with Elijah's sacrifice. Fire symbolizes purification and destruction, indicating that God's coming will be both a refining and a consuming force. The imagery of fire also connects to the Day of the Lord, a theme throughout prophetic literature, where God intervenes decisively in human history.<p><b>His chariots are like a whirlwind&#8212;</b><br>Chariots in ancient times were symbols of power and military might. The comparison to a whirlwind suggests speed, strength, and unstoppable force. This imagery conveys the idea that God's judgment will be swift and overwhelming. The whirlwind is also a common biblical metaphor for divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38:1</a> and <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, where God speaks out of the whirlwind, demonstrating His control over creation and history.<p><b>to execute His anger with fury</b><br>This phrase underscores the intensity of God's righteous anger against sin and injustice. The execution of anger with fury indicates a deliberate and powerful response to the rebellion and idolatry of the people. This reflects the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate sin. The concept of divine wrath is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23-24</a>, where God's fierce anger is described as a storm that will not turn back until He has accomplished His purposes.<p><b>and His rebuke with flames of fire.</b><br>Rebuke here implies correction and judgment. The use of "flames of fire" reinforces the idea of purification and destruction. Fire as a tool of rebuke suggests that God's judgment will be both a means of purifying the faithful and destroying the wicked. This dual purpose is seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where the Lord is described as a refiner's fire, purifying the sons of Levi. The imagery of fire as a rebuke also points to the final judgment, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9-10</a>, where fire from heaven consumes the enemies of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's sovereignty and power.

A signal outpouring of God's vengeance upon his enemies precedes the settlement of the Church in its final glorious condition, both in Isaiah and in the Revelation of St. John (see ch. 34, 35, and <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19-21</a>.). The wicked have to be removed before the righteous can be established in peace. Here the agencies employed against the wicked are "fire" and "sword" - fire pointing (as Delitzsch remarks) to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. God himself is represented as guiding and directing both agencies, to the punishment of the ungodly and the relief of those who trust in him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord will come with</span> <span class="cmt_word">fire.</span> "Fire" is a usual accompaniment of a "theophany." God descended on Sinai "in fire" (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), and led the Israelites through the wilderness by the pillar of the cloud and of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), and filled the tabernacle with a glory as of fire (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>), and "answered David from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering" (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), and in the same way answered Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). Isaiah almost always describes a theophany as a "coming with fire" (see <a href="/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27, 30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12, 14</a>, etc.). The agency of fire in the judgment that will overtake the wicked simultaneously with Christ's second coming, appears in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7-10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With his</span> <span class="cmt_word">chariots</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>). "Chariots," in the plural, may be regarded as symbolizing the "hosts" of natural and supernatural forces that God has at his command (Cheyne). Like a whirlwind. The whirring of the wheels of chariots, their noise, the swiftness of their pace, and the destruction that they cause, make this simile most appropriate.
