Historically, the context is the period of the Babylonian exile, where many nations were under Babylonian rule. The term "fugitives" suggests those who have escaped or are seeking refuge, possibly indicating those who have been scattered or displaced. This gathering is not just physical but spiritual, inviting them to acknowledge the true God. The call to "draw near" is reminiscent of the invitation to worship and know God, similar to the call in <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-3</a>, where God invites all to come to Him for sustenance and life.<p><b>Ignorant are those who carry idols of wood</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility and ignorance of idol worship. In the ancient Near East, idol-making was a common practice, with wood being a primary material for crafting these idols. The critique here is not just of the physical act of carrying idols but of the spiritual blindness it represents. The Bible frequently contrasts the living God with lifeless idols (e.g., <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). The use of "wood" emphasizes the perishable and powerless nature of these idols, in stark contrast to the eternal and omnipotent God. This critique is echoed in other parts of Isaiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the absurdity of idol worship is vividly depicted.<p><b>and pray to a god that cannot save.</b><br>This phrase underscores the impotence of idols and false gods. In the cultural context, people believed that their gods could protect and deliver them, yet the God of Israel declares that these gods are powerless. The inability to save is a central theme in the prophetic literature, where God repeatedly demonstrates His power over the nations and their gods (e.g., <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, where God executes judgment on the gods of Egypt). This phrase also points to the exclusivity of salvation through the God of Israel, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the only Savior (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). The prophetic message is clear: only the God of Israel has the power to save, a truth that is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fugitives_of_the_nations.htm">Fugitives of the Nations</a></b><br>This refers to people from various nations who are in exile or have fled from their homelands. In the context of Isaiah, it often refers to those who are outside of God's covenant people, Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_of_wood.htm">Idols of Wood</a></b><br>These are man-made objects of worship, often crafted from wood, representing false gods. In ancient times, these idols were common among pagan nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gods_that_cannot_save.htm">Gods That Cannot Save</a></b><br>This phrase highlights the impotence of idols and false gods, contrasting them with the one true God of Israel who has the power to save.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just a relic of the past but can manifest in modern forms such as materialism, career, or relationships that take precedence over God.

The prophet reverts to the main idea of the section, which is the conversion of the Gentiles, and calls on all "the escaped of the nation" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who have survived the judgments of the time - to "assemble and come," to consider the claims of Jehovah to be the only true God, to "look to him (ver. 22) and be saved." The great judgments through which the heathen will be brought to God have been frequently mentioned (<a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20, 21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11, 12, 25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13-15</a>, etc.). They must not be regarded as limited to the time of Cyrus, but rather as continuing into the Messianic period, and indeed nearly to its close (see especially ch. 34.).

It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or "arks" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101).
