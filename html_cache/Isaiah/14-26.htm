In the context of <a href="/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>, it follows a prophecy against Babylon, symbolizing God's judgment against pride and rebellion. The "whole earth" indicates the universal scope of God's plan, emphasizing His authority over all creation. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>, which states, "The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations." The plan includes both judgment and redemption, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the culmination of God's redemptive plan for humanity (<a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>).<p><b>and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations</b><br>The "hand stretched out" symbolizes God's active intervention and power. In biblical imagery, God's hand often represents His might and authority, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, "Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power, Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy." The phrase "over all the nations" underscores the universal reach of God's judgment and salvation. It connects to the theme of God's dominion over all nations, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>, where it is declared that "He does according to His will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth." This also foreshadows the eschatological vision in Revelation, where God's ultimate victory and reign over all nations are realized (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Judah was often under threat from surrounding nations, which is a context for many of Isaiah's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A dominant empire during Isaiah's time, often seen as an instrument of God's judgment against Israel and other nations. Isaiah's prophecies frequently address Assyria's rise and fall.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various peoples and kingdoms surrounding Israel and Judah.

<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The immediate context shows God&#8217;s judgment on Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-25</a>), yet the wording lifts the reader to see a divine strategy that reaches far beyond one empire.<p>&#8226; Because the Lord&#8217;s plan is rooted in His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>), it carries the same certainty as His promises of salvation (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) and His warnings of judgment (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226;
