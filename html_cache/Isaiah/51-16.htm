It echoes the calling of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>), where God places His words directly into the mouths of His chosen messengers. This signifies that the message delivered is not of human origin but is divinely ordained. The concept of God&#8217;s words being placed in the mouth of a prophet underscores the importance of the message and the responsibility of the messenger to speak truthfully and boldly.<p><b>and covered you with the shadow of My hand</b><br>This imagery suggests protection and guidance. The "shadow of My hand" is a metaphor for God's protective presence, similar to the way a shadow provides relief and shelter. This phrase can be connected to the Exodus narrative, where God protected the Israelites with a cloud by day and fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). It also reflects the intimate care God has for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, where those who dwell in the shelter of the Most High rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<p><b>to establish the heavens</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's sovereign power in creation. The establishment of the heavens is a reminder of God's role as Creator, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. It emphasizes His authority over the cosmos and His ability to bring order and purpose. Theologically, it points to the new creation themes found in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where a new heaven and a new earth are established, signifying the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>to found the earth</b><br>Here, the founding of the earth highlights God's foundational work in creation. It reflects the Genesis account where God laid the earth's foundations (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1-2</a>). This phrase underscores God's ongoing involvement in sustaining creation and His ultimate plan for restoration. It also connects to the idea of God as the architect of history, guiding events according to His divine will.<p><b>and to say to Zion, &#8216;You are My people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His people, Israel. Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, represents the spiritual and physical center of God's chosen people. This phrase echoes the covenantal promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) and the reaffirmation of Israel as God's people throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into God's people through Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>), where all believers are considered part of the spiritual Zion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is actively involved in creation and the protection of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, God's chosen people, and by extension, the Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's creative power and His authority over all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is speaking, delivering His message to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shadow_of_god's_hand.htm">The Shadow of God's Hand</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's protection and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is not only creative but also authoritative and transformative.

Some commentators detach this verse altogether from the preceding passage, and regard it as a fragment intruded here out of its proper place by some unaccountable accident. From the close resemblance of the expressions used to those in <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, they consider that the person addressed must be "the Servant of Jehovah," and hence conclude that the verse "originally stood in some other context" (Cheyne). It is, however, quite possible to regard Israel as still addressed; since Israel too was the recipient of God's words (see <a href="/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>), and was protected by God's hand from destruction, and kept in existence until the happy time should come when God would create a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) for Israel's dwelling-place<span class="cmt_word">, and say unto Zion</span> - <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the "new Jerusalem" <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my people</span>. This crowning promise well terminates the comforting address wherewith Jehovah at this time saw fit to cheer and encourage his captive people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/51-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
