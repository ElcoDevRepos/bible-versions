This title indicates a position of significant authority, suggesting the importance of the message he carried. The Assyrian Empire, under King Sennacherib, was a dominant power, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The sending of the Rabshakeh signifies the seriousness of the Assyrian threat to Judah.<p><b>with a great army,</b><br>The presence of a great army underscores the intimidation tactics employed by Assyria. This military show of force was intended to coerce submission without battle. Historically, Assyria was known for its large, well-equipped armies, which were instrumental in its conquests. The mention of a great army highlights the dire situation facing Jerusalem and King Hezekiah.<p><b>from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.</b><br>Lachish was a significant fortified city in Judah, and its capture by the Assyrians was a strategic victory. Archaeological evidence, such as the Lachish Reliefs, depicts the siege and conquest of Lachish, illustrating Assyrian military might. The movement from Lachish to Jerusalem indicates the Assyrian campaign's progression and the imminent threat to the capital city, where King Hezekiah reigned.<p><b>And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool,</b><br>The aqueduct of the upper pool was a crucial water source for Jerusalem, located near the city's defenses. This location was strategic for psychological warfare, as controlling water supplies could lead to a city's surrender. The mention of the aqueduct connects to earlier events in <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>, where Isaiah met King Ahaz, Hezekiah's father, at the same location, highlighting continuity in the prophetic narrative.<p><b>on the road to the Launderer&#8217;s Field.</b><br>The Launderer&#8217;s Field was likely an area outside Jerusalem used for washing clothes, indicating a location near the city's outskirts. This setting emphasizes the public nature of the Assyrian envoy's message, intended to demoralize the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The choice of this location for the Rabshakeh's speech was symbolic, as it was a place where many people would gather, ensuring the message reached a wide audience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The ruler of the Assyrian Empire, a dominant power during this period, known for its military might and conquests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>A high-ranking Assyrian official or military commander sent as a spokesperson to deliver messages and negotiate on behalf of the Assyrian king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lachish.htm">Lachish</a></b><br>A significant city in Judah, which was under siege or control by the Assyrians at this time, demonstrating their reach and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, representing the spiritual and political heart of the Jewish people, and the focal point of the Assyrian threat.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/a/aqueduct_of_the_upper_pool.htm">Aqueduct of the Upper Pool</a></b><br>A water source in Jerusalem, significant for its strategic importance during a siege.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/l/launderer's_field.htm">Launderer&#8217;s Field</a></b><br>A location in Jerusalem, possibly a place where clothes were washed, indicating a specific and recognizable landmark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_amidst_threats.htm">Trust in God Amidst Threats</a></b><br>Hezekiah faced a formidable enemy, yet his account encourages believers to trust in God's protection and deliverance, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat included seeking God's guidance through prayer, reminding us of the importance of turning to God in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_preparation.htm">Strategic Preparation</a></b><br>While Hezekiah trusted God, he also took practical steps to prepare for the siege, teaching us the balance between faith and action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Hezekiah's leadership during a national crisis serves as a model for godly leadership, emphasizing reliance on God and wise decision-making.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The Assyrian threat and God's eventual deliverance of Jerusalem illustrate His sovereignty over the affairs of nations and His ability to protect His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_36_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 36:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_36_2_God_s_rule_over_power.htm">How does Isaiah 36:2 illustrate God's sovereignty over political and military power?

In 2 Kings 18; 2 Chronicles 32, we have the previous history of the war. Hezekiah, on hearing Sennacherib's reproach, began to strengthen the fortifications of Jerusalem, called his officers and troops together, and made an appeal to their faith and courage. In Isaiah 22 we have the prophet's view of those preparations. Probably by Isaiah's advice, who put no confidence in this boastful and blustering courage, Hezekiah sent to Sennacherib, who was then besieging Lachish, to sue for peace, acknowledging that he had offended. A penalty of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold was imposed and paid, Hezekiah being reduced to empty his own treasury and that of the Temple, and even to strip the Temple doors and pillars of the plates of gold with which they were overlaid. Peace, however, was not to be had even at that price. Encouraged, perhaps, by this prompt submission, and tearing up the treaty (the breach of covenant of which Isaiah complains in <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm" title="The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.">Isaiah 35:1</a>), Sennacherib sent his officers, the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh (the names are all official titles) to demand an unconditional surrender.<p><span class= "bld">He stood by the conduit of the upper pool.</span>--The spot was the same as that at which Isaiah had addressed Ahaz thirty or more years before (<a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;">Isaiah 7:3</a>). It was probably chosen by the Rabshakeh as commanding one end of the aqueduct which supplied the city with water, and thus enabling him to threaten that he&#250; would cut off the supply (<a href="/isaiah/36-12.htm" title="But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?">Isaiah 36:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria sent Rabshakeh... with a great army</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-17</a>, where we find sufficient ground for believing that this expedition is entirely distinct from that of ver. 1, which was conducted by Sennacherib in person, and led to Hezekiah's submission and the payment of a large tribute). It is inconceivable that, immediately after the grant of terms of peace and their acceptance, Sennacherib should have renewed the war; there must have been an interval, and a fresh provocation. The interval can have been only a short one, since Hezekiah died in <span class="date">B.C. 697</span>. It may have been a couple of years, or perhaps no more than a year, or possibly only a few months. The fresh provocation probably consisted in an application for aid, made by Hezekiah to Tir-hakah, or to the subordinate Egyptian kings, which is glanced at in ver. 6. The Assyrian annals, which never record any reverse or defeat, are wholly silent as to this second expedition. The only profane confirmation of it is to be found in Herodotus (2:141). <span class="cmt_word">From Lackish</span>. Laehish, an ancient city of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>), was assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), and seems to have been still a Jewish possession (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>). It occupied "a low round swell or knoll" in the Shefelch, or low tract between the Judaean highland and the Mediterranean, and lay near, if not directly on, the direct route which armies commonly followed in their march from Syria into Egypt. The site is now known as <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; it lies between Gaza and <span class="accented">Ajlan</span> (Eglon), about two miles west of the hitter.
