The "gulf of the Sea of Egypt" likely refers to the Red Sea, reminiscent of the Exodus when God parted the waters for the Israelites to escape from Pharaoh's army. The term "devote to destruction" suggests a complete and irrevocable act, often used in the context of holy war or divine judgment (see <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). This imagery evokes God's power over nature and His ability to deliver His people from bondage, symbolizing a future deliverance.<p><b>with a scorching wind He will sweep His hand over the Euphrates.</b><br>The Euphrates River was a significant geographical boundary in the ancient Near East, often representing the limits of Israel's promised land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). A "scorching wind" implies a powerful, destructive force, possibly alluding to the sirocco winds known in the region. This act of sweeping His hand signifies God's sovereign control over nations and natural elements, reminiscent of His past interventions in history. The Euphrates also symbolizes the boundary of Assyrian and Babylonian empires, suggesting a future judgment on these oppressors.<p><b>He will split it into seven streams</b><br>The splitting into "seven streams" suggests a miraculous transformation of the river, making it easily passable. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, indicating a thorough and perfect act of divine intervention. This imagery parallels the parting of the Red Sea and the Jordan River, emphasizing God's ability to remove obstacles for His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration and peace in God's kingdom, where barriers are removed.<p><b>for men to cross with dry sandals.</b><br>Crossing "with dry sandals" recalls the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea and the Jordan River on dry ground (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>, <a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). This phrase underscores God's provision and protection, ensuring safe passage for His people. It symbolizes the ease and assurance of God's deliverance, contrasting with the struggles and dangers of previous journeys. This imagery points to a future time of peace and restoration, where God's people will experience unhindered access to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who exercises His power over nature and nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_egypt.htm">The Sea of Egypt</a></b><br>Likely referring to the Red Sea, symbolizing obstacles and barriers that God can remove.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_euphrates.htm">The Euphrates</a></b><br>A major river in the ancient Near East, representing significant geopolitical boundaries.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scorching_wind.htm">Scorching Wind</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's powerful intervention and judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_streams.htm">Seven Streams</a></b><br>Symbolic of completeness and divine perfection, indicating God's thorough provision and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>God has the power to alter natural landscapes to fulfill His purposes.

Past miracles become guarantees of future ones (<a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene hints at a worldwide gathering: every hindrance&#8212;land or water&#8212;is neutralized so the redeemed can come home (<a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12-13</a>).<p>Takeaway: God&#8217;s deliverance is not barely adequate; it is abundant, accessible, and invites all who trust Him (<a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a> promises a second, greater exodus.

And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:">Joshua 15:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-19.htm" title="And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.">Joshua 18:19</a>, the "bay" or "gulf." The "Egyptian sea" is the Gulf of Suez, and the prophet pictures to himself another marvel like the passage of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14-22.htm" title="And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.">Exodus 14:22</a>. The "river," on the other hand, is the word Commonly used for the Euphrates (<a href="/genesis/31-21.htm" title="So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.">Genesis 31:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.">Joshua 24:2</a>), and that meaning is assigned to it here by most commentators, who refer to <a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm" title="That said to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers:">Isaiah 44:27</a> as a parallel. In <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>, however, it is found, as here, in parallelism with the "sea" of Egypt, and as it there refers to the Nile, that meaning may well be accepted here. The prophet describes, in language which almost excludes the thought of a merely literal fulfilment, a renewal of wonders transcending those of the Exodus, and it was natural that his description should bear the local colouring of the region. He contemplates a return from Egypt as much as from Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>). On this view the words that follow, "will smite it in the seven streams," refer naturally enough to the seven mouths that enclose and intersect the Delta of the Nile. On the other view, the words may be interpreted as meaning literally, "I will smite it [Euphrates] into seven streams," and figuratively, "I will reduce the power of Assyria [or Babylon, as an Assyrian city] to insignificance." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall utterly destroy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall lay under a curse</span> (Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The tongue of the Egyptian sea</span>.
