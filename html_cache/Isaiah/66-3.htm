In ancient Israel, oxen were valuable for their use in agriculture and as sacrificial animals. The comparison to murder underscores the severity of performing religious rituals with a corrupt heart. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is prioritized over sacrifice. The prophet Isaiah often criticized empty religious practices (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>).<p><b>Whoever sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog&#8217;s neck;</b><br>Lambs were commonly used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing innocence and purity. The act of breaking a dog's neck, an unclean animal in Jewish law, represents a detestable act. This juxtaposition emphasizes the worthlessness of sacrifices made without true devotion. The imagery serves as a stark warning against superficial worship, aligning with the broader biblical theme that God desires mercy and knowledge of Him over burnt offerings (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p><b>Whoever presents a grain offering is like one who offers pig&#8217;s blood;</b><br>Grain offerings were part of the Levitical sacrifices, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God. Offering pig's blood, however, would be abhorrent to Jewish sensibilities, as pigs were considered unclean animals (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). This comparison illustrates the abomination of insincere worship and the defilement of sacred practices. It reflects the prophetic call for purity of heart and intention, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>.<p><b>Whoever offers frankincense is like one who blesses an idol.</b><br>Frankincense was a valuable incense used in worship and offerings, symbolizing prayer and devotion. Blessing an idol, however, is an act of idolatry, directly violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase condemns the mixing of true worship with idolatrous practices, a recurring issue in Israel's history. It serves as a reminder of the exclusive devotion God requires, as emphasized in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>Indeed, they have chosen their own ways and delighted in their abominations.</b><br>This statement summarizes the people's rebellion and preference for their sinful practices over God's commands. Choosing their own ways signifies a deliberate rejection of divine guidance, leading to spiritual and moral decay. The delight in abominations indicates a hardened heart, reminiscent of the idolatry and corruption condemned by the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). This phrase calls for repentance and a return to sincere worship, aligning with the prophetic message of restoration and hope for those who turn back to God (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry was primarily to the Kingdom of Judah.

Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord," etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">As if he out off a dog's neck</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog."
