Historically, the Israelites faced situations where they built homes and planted vineyards, only for foreign invaders to take them over. This promise signifies a future of stability and security, where the fruits of one's labor are not taken by others. It echoes the blessings of obedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where the faithful are assured that they will enjoy the fruits of their labor. This also points to a future Messianic age where justice and righteousness prevail, aligning with the prophetic vision of peace and prosperity.<p><b>For as is the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,</b><br>Trees, particularly in the ancient Near East, symbolize longevity and endurance. The comparison to a tree suggests a life of stability, strength, and continuity for God's people. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references, such as <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water. The promise of long life is a blessing that contrasts with the brevity and uncertainty of life under sin and judgment. It also hints at the eternal life promised through the New Covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to His followers.<p><b>and My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.</b><br>This assurance highlights a future where God's people will experience the fullness of their labor without fear of loss or exploitation. It reflects the original intent of creation, where humanity was to work and enjoy the fruits of the earth (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). The term "chosen ones" underscores the special relationship between God and His people, reminiscent of the covenantal promises made to Abraham and his descendants. This phrase also connects to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God&#8217;s people will dwell in a new creation, free from pain and suffering, fully enjoying the blessings of their labor in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
