In the context of Isaiah, God is revealing new things to His people, which were not previously known or understood. This reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to bring about new events or revelations in His timing. Theologically, it underscores the idea that God is not bound by time and can introduce new elements into His divine plan. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the new covenant brought through Jesus Christ, who is described as bringing a new creation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>you have not heard of them before today.</b><br>This highlights the element of surprise and the unexpected nature of God's revelation. Historically, Israel often struggled with understanding God's plans, as they were accustomed to relying on past experiences and traditions. This phrase suggests that God's ways are beyond human comprehension and that He can reveal truths that were previously hidden. It also serves as a reminder of the prophetic nature of Isaiah's ministry, where God often revealed future events that were not yet understood by the people.<p><b>So you cannot claim, &#8216;I already knew them!&#8217;</b><br>This statement addresses human pride and the tendency to claim understanding or foresight. It serves as a rebuke to those who might boast in their own wisdom or insight. Biblically, it reflects the theme that true wisdom and knowledge come from God alone (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God often acts in ways that confound human expectations, as seen in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled prophecies in ways that were not anticipated by the religious leaders of His time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

What is meant is that the things which had been from the beginning in the mind of God are now, for the first time, manifested, through the prophet, as about to pass into act. What these are the prophet develops in the following chapters, as including the spiritual redemption and restoration of Israel. They were kept in store, as it were, to make men wonder (<a href="/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25-26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even before the day when . . .</span>--Better, and <span class= "ital">before to-day thou heardest them not<span class= "bld">. . .</span> .</span> The reason given for what we might almost call this method of reserve and reticence, was that the people had been till now unprepared to receive the truth, and in their state it would but have increased their condemnation (<a href="/john/16-12.htm" title="I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.">John 16:12</a>; <a href="/mark/4-33.htm" title="And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it.">Mark 4:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are created now</span>.

The mystery of "the Servant of the Lord," and of atonement and salvation through him, had hitherto been hid away - "hid in God" (<a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>), and was now for the first time to be made known to such as had "eyes to see" and "cars to hear" by the teaching of the evangelical prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Even before the day when thou heardest them not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and before to-day thou heardest them not.</span> Whatever shadows of evangelic truth are discernible in the Law and in the earlier psalms, they did not constitute a revelation of the way of salvation at all comparable to that contained in Isaiah's later chapters. <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them</span>. If the "new things" of Isaiah's prophecy had been revealed many centuries before, they would not have impressed the Jews of Isaiah's time, or even of the Captivity period, as they did by having been reserved to a comparatively late date. They would have seemed to most of them an old and trite story. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/48-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They are created</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7687;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1254.htm">Strong's 1254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To create, to cut down, select, feed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">long ago;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard of them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">today,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so you cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pen-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6435.htm">Strong's 6435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Removal, lest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">claim,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I already</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
