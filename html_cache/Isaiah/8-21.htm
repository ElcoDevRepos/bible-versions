The context is the impending Assyrian invasion, which would lead to devastation and scarcity. The imagery of roaming suggests a lack of direction and purpose, highlighting the consequences of turning away from God. Historically, this reflects the period of instability and fear as the Northern Kingdom faced threats from powerful empires. Theologically, it underscores the spiritual famine that accompanies physical deprivation when people reject divine guidance.<p><b>When they are famished, they will become enraged;</b><br>The physical hunger leads to emotional and spiritual turmoil. This reflects a common biblical theme where unmet physical needs can lead to spiritual crises. The anger mentioned here is a result of desperation and a sense of betrayal, as the people feel abandoned in their time of need. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative where reliance on God is contrasted with the futility of self-reliance or idolatry. The phrase also serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring prophetic messages and divine warnings.<p><b>and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God.</b><br>This phrase indicates a misplaced blame for their suffering. Instead of introspection and repentance, the people direct their anger towards their leaders and God. Cursing the king reflects a loss of trust in earthly authority, while cursing God shows a deep spiritual rebellion. This mirrors the human tendency to blame external forces rather than acknowledging personal or communal sin. Biblically, this is reminiscent of the Israelites' complaints during the Exodus. Theologically, it highlights the need for faith and trust in God, even in times of hardship, and foreshadows the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was also cursed and rejected by His own people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, who are facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, warning of the consequences of turning away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Likely referring to the earthly king of Judah, who is seen as a representative of the nation's leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and the one whom the people are ultimately rebelling against.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Judah, which will experience desolation and hardship as a result of the people's actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God leads to spiritual and physical desolation.

The abruptness with which the verse opens, the absence of any noun to which the pronoun "it" may refer, has led some critics (Cheyne) to transpose the two verses. So arranged, the thought of the people for whom there is no dawning passes naturally into the picture of their groping in that thick darkness. and then the misery of that midnight wandering is aggravated by the horrors of starvation. The words may point to the horrors of a literal famine (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm" title="The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:11</a>); but as the darkness is clearly figurative, so probably is the hunger--not a famine of bread, but of hearing the word of the Lord. The Authorised version rightly translates the indefinite singular by the plural.<p><span class= "bld">When they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves.</span>--The faithful who waited for the Lord might bear even that darkness and that hunger, as soldiers bear their night-march fasting before the battle. Not so with the panic-stricken and superstitious crowd. With them despair would show itself in curses. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/16-11.htm" title="And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.">Revelation 16:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>.) They would curse at once the king who had led them to destruction, and the God whom they had neglected. Possibly the words may mean, "the king who is also their God," as in <a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> (Heb.) and <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a>; but the analogy of <a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm" title="And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.">1Kings 21:13</a> is in favour of the more literal meaning. The "upward" look is, we must remember, that of despair and defiance, not of hope. Upwards, downwards, behind, before, there is nothing for them but the darkness in which they are driven, or drifting onward. All seems utterly hopeless. Like Dante, they find themselves in a land "where silent is the sun." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22</span> are supposed by some to be cut of place, and to belong properly to the description of the Assyrian invasion, given in vers. 7, 8.
