The nation referred to is Israel, which is often depicted in the Old Testament as God's chosen people who have strayed from His commandments. This lamentation sets the tone for the entire book of Isaiah, which addresses the spiritual and moral decline of Israel. The concept of a "sinful nation" is echoed in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Hosea, where the prophets call out the people's unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>A people laden with iniquity</b><br>The imagery of being "laden" suggests a heavy burden, indicating that the people's sins are numerous and weigh them down. This phrase highlights the pervasive nature of sin within the community, affecting every aspect of their lives. Iniquity refers to moral corruption and injustice, which were prevalent in Israel during this period. The burden of sin is a recurring theme in Scripture, with Jesus later offering rest to those who are weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p><b>A brood of evildoers</b><br>The term "brood" implies a generation or offspring, suggesting that the propensity for evil is being passed down through the generations. This phrase underscores the idea that the people are not only committing acts of evil but are characterized by it. The concept of a "brood of evildoers" is reminiscent of Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees as a "brood of vipers" (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>), indicating a deep-seated corruption.<p><b>Children who act corruptly</b><br>The use of "children" here emphasizes the relationship between God and Israel, where God is the Father and Israel is His child. Acting corruptly indicates a betrayal of this relationship, as the children are not living according to the covenant established with God. This corruption is seen in their idolatry, social injustice, and failure to uphold God's laws. The imagery of wayward children is also found in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), illustrating the hope of redemption.<p><b>They have forsaken the LORD</b><br>Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate abandonment of their covenant relationship with God. This is a central theme in the prophetic literature, where the prophets call the people to return to God. The act of forsaking God is often linked to idolatry and the worship of foreign gods, which was a significant issue in Israel's history. The call to return to the LORD is a recurring invitation throughout the book of Isaiah.<p><b>They have despised the Holy One of Israel</b><br>The "Holy One of Israel" is a title for God that emphasizes His purity, righteousness, and unique relationship with Israel. To despise God is to reject His authority and holiness. This rejection is not just a matter of neglect but an active disdain for God's character and commands. The title "Holy One of Israel" is used frequently in Isaiah, underscoring the contrast between God's holiness and the people's sinfulness.<p><b>And turned their backs on Him</b><br>Turning their backs signifies a complete rejection and turning away from God. This imagery suggests a willful decision to ignore God's presence and guidance. In biblical times, turning one's back was a sign of disrespect and defiance. This act of turning away is contrasted with the call to repentance, where the people are urged to turn back to God and seek His forgiveness. The theme of turning away and returning is central to the message of the prophets and is fulfilled in the New Testament through the call to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

Yet every indictment implies an invitation: return to the LORD who alone lifts burdens, cleanses corruption, and welcomes prodigals. God&#8217;s grief underscores His love; His warnings are calls to repentance, not final sentences.

(Comp. <a href="/luke/16-13.htm" title="No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Luke 16:13</a>). In the "Holy One of Israel" we have the Divine name on which Isaiah most delights to dwell, and which had been impressed on his mind by the <span class= "ital">Trisagion</span>, which accompanied his first call to the office of a prophet (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The thought expressed by the name is that all ideas of consecration, purity, and holiness are gathered up in God. The term occurs fourteen times in the first part of Isaiah, and sixteen times in the second. A corrupt people needed to be reminded ever more and more of the truth which the name asserted. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah sinful nation.</span> These are the words of Isaiah, not of Jehovah. The prophet, having delivered God's message in vers. 2 and 3, proceeds to impress and enforce it on the people by remarks of his own. He begins with a lamentation over their wickedness and impenitence; "Ah sinful nation!" or "Alas for the sinful nation! "the nation called to be holy (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, etc.), but sunk in sin and wickedness. How sad their condition! How almost hopeless! <span class="cmt_word">Laden with iniquity</span>; literally, <span class="accented">heavy with guilt</span>. But our version well expresses the sense. As the psalmist says, "My sins have gone up over my head, and are like a sore burden, toe heavy for me to bear" (<a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A seed of evil-doers.</span> Not descendants of evil-doors, but "an evil-doing seed, "or "race" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Children that are corrupters</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sons that do corruptly</span>. It is not their corrupting of others, though that might follow, but the corruption that was in themselves, which is spoken cf. The corruption was both moral and doctrinal (see ver. 21). In corroboration of the fact, see <a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They have forsaken</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> Not by renouncing his worship, which they still continued (see vers. 11-15), but by reducing it to a formality. The people "honored him with their lips, while their hearts were far from him" (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have provoked to anger</span>; rather, <span class="accented">despised</span> (Revised Version), or <span class="accented">scorched</span> (Kay, Cheyne), or <span class="accented">rejected with disdain</span> (Lowth), in allusion to their disobeying his commandments (see vers. 21-23). <span class="cmt_word">The Holy One of Israel.</span> This title of God is a favorite one with Isaiah (see <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19, 24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17, 20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19, 23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11, 12, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14, 16, 20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3, 14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9, 14</a>), and is very rarely used by the other sacred writers. We find it thrice in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/71-22.htm">Psalm 71:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>); once in Kings (<a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>), but then in the mouth of Isaiah; twice in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:29; 51:5); and once in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). According to Isaiah's conception of God, holiness is the most essential element of his nature (see <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They are gone away backward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they are estranged backwards</span>; or, as Bishop Lowth paraphrases, "they are estranged from him; they have turned their back upon him." Instead of looking to God, and following after him, they "followed a multitude to do evil (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Alas,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah! alas! ha!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O sinful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1496;&#1461;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7789;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb -
