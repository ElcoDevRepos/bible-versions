In the context of Isaiah, God is addressing the people of Israel, assuring them of His power and sovereignty. The phrase suggests a public demonstration of God's intervention, which is meant to be undeniable and evident to all. This aligns with the biblical theme of God revealing Himself through His works, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God. The visibility of God's actions serves as a testament to His existence and authority, intended to lead people to acknowledge Him.<p><b>may consider and understand</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to reflection and comprehension. The call to consider and understand implies a deeper level of engagement beyond mere observation. It suggests that God's works are not only to be seen but also to be pondered and grasped intellectually and spiritually. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, which often encourages understanding and discernment. The phrase invites individuals to meditate on God's deeds, leading to a fuller appreciation of His nature and purposes.<p><b>that the hand of the LORD has done this</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" is a metaphor for God's power and action. In biblical terms, the hand signifies strength, authority, and capability. This phrase underscores that the events or transformations being witnessed are directly attributable to God's intervention. It is a reminder of God's active role in the world, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, where God's hand is celebrated for delivering Israel from Egypt. The emphasis on God's hand assures the audience that what is happening is not by chance or human effort but by divine orchestration.<p><b>and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</b><br>The title "Holy One of Israel" is a distinctive name for God in Isaiah, highlighting His uniqueness, purity, and covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase asserts God's role as Creator, not only in the sense of the original creation but also in His ongoing creative work in history and in the lives of His people. It reflects the biblical theme of God as the ultimate source of all things, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. The use of "created" suggests newness and transformation, pointing to God's ability to bring about change and renewal, which can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings new creation through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people and the creator of all things.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_one_of_israel.htm">The Holy One of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His holiness and unique relationship with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God to be His people, through whom He reveals His power and glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God bringing the universe and all life into existence, demonstrating His power and sovereignty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience (All)</a></b><br>The people who are to witness and understand the works of God, both Israelites and the nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognizing God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Understand that everything in creation points back to the power and authority of God.

They are designed for visibility.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s works are public, inviting &#8220;all&#8221; to notice (<a href="/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>).<p>&#8226; No corner of creation is too remote for His witness (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;see and know&#8221; joins sight with certainty; the evidence is meant to dismantle doubt just as surely as the Red Sea parted before an entire nation (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May consider and understand</b><p>Seeing can remain superficial, so the verse pushes deeper.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Consider&#8221; calls people to pause, ponder, and connect the dots, like Job was urged: &#8220;Stop and consider God&#8217;s wonders&#8221; (<a href="/job/37-14.htm">Job 37:14</a>).<p>&#8226; True understanding moves from the eyes to the heart (<a href="/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord longs for reflective faith, not a fleeting glance&#8212;echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>, where Israel is urged to &#8220;discern&#8221; the meaning of God&#8217;s acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That the hand of the LORD has done this</b><p>Attention now shifts from the miracle to its Source.<p>&#8226; In Scripture the &#8220;hand of the LORD&#8221; signifies personal, active power (<a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>; <a href="/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By attributing the transformation directly to His hand, Isaiah rules out coincidence, natural explanation, or idol (<a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The same hand rescued from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>), guided through the wilderness, and still moves today&#8212;unchanged, unweakened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the Holy One of Israel has created it</b><p>Isaiah layers identity upon identity.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Holy One&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s moral perfection, setting Him apart from every false god (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; 40:25).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Of Israel&#8221; reminds the nation of their covenant relationship; the God who forms forests in the desert is the God who formed them (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Created&#8221; ties these fresh wonders to the original creation (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).
