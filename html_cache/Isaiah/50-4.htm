In the context of Isaiah, this is often seen as a reference to the Servant of the Lord, a figure who embodies obedience and wisdom. The "tongue of discipleship" suggests a learned and trained ability to communicate God's truth effectively. This can be connected to Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the Servant prophecies in Isaiah. In the New Testament, Jesus is frequently depicted as a teacher with unparalleled authority and wisdom (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p><b>to sustain the weary with a word</b><br>The purpose of the Servant's teaching is to provide comfort and encouragement to those who are weary. This reflects the compassionate nature of God, who cares for the downtrodden and oppressed. In the historical context, the Israelites were often in need of such encouragement, especially during times of exile and hardship. This phrase can also be linked to Jesus' ministry, where He offers rest to the weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>He awakens Me morning by morning</b><br>This indicates a continual and daily renewal of the Servant's mission and purpose. The phrase suggests a disciplined and consistent relationship with God, where the Servant receives guidance and strength each day. This can be seen as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of daily devotion and reliance on God. In the Gospels, Jesus is shown to have a regular practice of prayer and communion with the Father, often rising early to pray (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p><b>He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple</b><br>The emphasis here is on the Servant's receptiveness and obedience to God's instruction. Listening "as a disciple" implies a posture of humility and readiness to learn. This is crucial for understanding the role of the Servant, who is both a teacher and a learner. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects the ideal relationship between God and His people, where they are attentive and responsive to His voice. Jesus exemplifies this perfect obedience and attentiveness to the Father's will, as seen in His statements about doing only what He sees the Father doing (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who empowers and instructs His servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Often interpreted as the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who embodies the perfect disciple and teacher.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_weary.htm">The Weary</a></b><br>Those who are burdened, tired, or in need of encouragement and strength.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/discipleship.htm">Discipleship</a></b><br>The process of learning and following the teachings of a master, in this context, the teachings of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/morning_by_morning.htm">Morning by Morning</a></b><br>A phrase indicating regular, daily communication and renewal with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_word.htm">The Power of the Word</a></b><br>God equips His servants with words that can uplift and sustain those who are weary.
