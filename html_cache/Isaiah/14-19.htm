The imagery of a "rejected branch" may symbolize a broken lineage or failed leadership, often associated with judgment. In biblical context, this can be linked to the fate of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16-17</a>, where the wicked's memory perishes. The rejection of a branch also echoes the imagery of Israel as a vine or tree, where unfruitful branches are cut off (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>).<p><b>covered by those slain with the sword</b><br>This indicates a violent and ignominious end, common in the prophetic literature as a sign of divine judgment. The sword is frequently a symbol of war and divine retribution (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). The covering by the slain suggests being overwhelmed or surrounded by death, emphasizing the totality of the judgment. This can be compared to the fate of the wicked in <a href="/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>, where those opposing God are slain by the sword.<p><b>and dumped into a rocky pit</b><br>The "rocky pit" signifies a place of desolation and abandonment, often associated with Sheol or the grave in Hebrew thought. This imagery is reminiscent of the fate of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>, where they are likened to those who go down to the pit. The rocky pit contrasts with a proper burial, highlighting the shame and disgrace of the individual. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was buried in a borrowed tomb, yet His resurrection overcame the grave's shame (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>).<p><b>like a carcass trampled underfoot</b><br>This phrase underscores the ultimate humiliation and desecration, as trampling is a sign of contempt and defeat. In ancient warfare, the bodies of the defeated were often left unburied, subject to scavengers and trampling, as a sign of total victory by the conquerors. This imagery is used in <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>, where the Lord tramples the virgin daughter of Judah. The trampling of a carcass can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's victory over death and sin, where He triumphs over His enemies (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fallen_king_of_babylon.htm">The Fallen King of Babylon</a></b><br>This passage is part of a taunt against the king of Babylon, symbolizing pride and arrogance that leads to downfall.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grave.htm">The Grave (Sheol)</a></b><br>Represents the realm of the dead, often depicted as a place of shame for those who are not honored in death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rejected_branch.htm">The Rejected Branch</a></b><br>Symbolizes something that was once part of a living tree but is now discarded, representing the king's fall from power and grace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slain_and_pierced_by_the_sword.htm">The Slain and Pierced by the Sword</a></b><br>Refers to those who have died violently, emphasizing the disgraceful end of the king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pit.htm">The Pit</a></b><br>Another term for Sheol, indicating a place of deep humiliation and defeat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Pride leads to downfall and disgrace.

Again "thou" is emphatic. Translate, <span class="accented">But thou - thou art cast out</span>. The Babylonian monarch did not rest in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. His body was "cast out" - left, apparently, where it fell in battle.

So was it with the corpse of the great king. <span class="cmt_word">That go down to the stones of the pit</span>. This clause is thought to be misplaced. It deranges the meter and damages the sense. Corpses were not interred on fields of battle in the East (Herod., 3:26). They were left to be "trodden underfoot." It is best, with Ewald and Mr. Cheyne, to transfer the clause to the commencement of the next verse.
