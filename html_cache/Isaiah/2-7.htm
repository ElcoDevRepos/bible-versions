The accumulation of silver and gold signifies economic success but also suggests a potential reliance on wealth rather than on God. In biblical context, wealth is often seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>), but it can also lead to pride and idolatry (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The abundance of silver and gold may also reflect the influence of neighboring nations and their trade practices, which could lead to the adoption of foreign customs and gods.<p><b>with no limit to their treasures</b><br>The phrase indicates an abundance that seems boundless, suggesting a society that places great value on material possessions. This can be seen as a warning against the dangers of materialism and the false sense of security it provides. In the historical context, treasures were often stored in temples or palaces, symbolizing both wealth and power. The limitless treasures could also imply a neglect of spiritual wealth, as Jesus later teaches about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>their land is full of horses</b><br>Horses in ancient times were symbols of military strength and power. The presence of many horses suggests a focus on military might and self-reliance for protection and security. This reliance on horses and chariots is contrary to the biblical teaching that true security comes from trusting in God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The accumulation of horses was also explicitly warned against for kings in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, indicating a potential disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>with no limit to their chariots</b><br>Chariots were advanced military technology in the ancient Near East, representing a formidable force in battle. The phrase suggests an overemphasis on military preparedness and a potential arms race with surrounding nations. This reliance on chariots can be seen as a lack of faith in God's protection, as seen in the story of the Exodus where God triumphs over the chariots of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-28</a>). The abundance of chariots may also reflect a societal shift towards valuing power and dominance over justice and righteousness, which are central themes in the prophetic messages of Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Solomon&#8217;s &#8220;silver was considered nothing&#8221; in his day (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>), yet that very abundance helped pull hearts away from the LORD. The prophet is highlighting:<p>&#8226; An undeniable blessing&#8212;economic strength granted by God (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; A dangerous shift&#8212;from gratitude to self-sufficiency (<a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a>).<p>&#8226; A warning light&#8212;riches that crowd out dependence on the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with no limit to their treasures</b><p>The phrase stresses not just plenty, but boundlessness&#8212;stockpiles guarded, counted, and continually expanded.

By Isaiah&#8217;s day, the stables rivaled Solomon&#8217;s famed collection (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-28</a>).
