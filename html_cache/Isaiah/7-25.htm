In the context of Isaiah, briers and thorns symbolize desolation and the curse of the land due to disobedience (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). The fear mentioned here reflects the anxiety and danger associated with a land that has become wild and untamed, a common theme in prophetic literature where the land suffers due to the people's sin (<a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>).<p><b>you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe</b><br>The hills represent fertile areas that were once cultivated and productive. The use of the hoe signifies human effort and agricultural activity, which are now abandoned. This reflects the historical context of the Assyrian invasion, where once-prosperous lands were left desolate. The imagery serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God, leading to the loss of blessings and prosperity.<p><b>they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample</b><br>This transformation from cultivated land to pastureland indicates a reversal of fortune. Oxen and sheep grazing suggest a return to a more primitive state, where the land is no longer used for its intended purpose. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual decline, where the people of God, once fruitful, have become barren. The imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of judgment and restoration, where God allows desolation as a means to bring His people back to repentance (<a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

This is not mere inconvenience; it is a visible sign of God&#8217;s judgment.<p>- In <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a> the Lord tells Adam, &#8220;Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you,&#8221; linking thorns to the curse on human rebellion. Isaiah echoes that reality: when people turn from the Lord, creation itself turns hostile.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-31</a> shows a neglected field &#8220;covered with thistles,&#8221; picturing spiritual and moral neglect. Israel&#8217;s fear flows from knowing that the overgrowth is a divine warning, not simply a natural occurrence (see also <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; 32:13-14).<p>- Practically, thorns hinder travel, harvest, and security. They illustrate how sin&#8217;s consequences invade every sphere of life, making even basic movement hazardous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe</b><p>- Hills that had been carefully cultivated are now abandoned. The change is total: from orderly terraces to impassable terrain.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a> predicts that foreign nations &#8220;will consume the produce of your land,&#8221; leaving the people empty-handed. Isaiah specifies the outcome&#8212;fields no longer walked because no one dares face the thorny obstruction.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a> urges, &#8220;Break up your fallow ground,&#8221; implying that ground can become fallow through neglect or invasion. Judah has reached that stage: hoes rest idle, farmers stay away, and food security evaporates.<p>- The once-tilled hills remind us how quickly blessings disappear when a nation rejects God&#8217;s covenant (compare <a href="/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a> and <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample</b><p>- Abandoned cropland turns to rough pasture. Domestic animals wander where crops used to grow, because there are no walls, no watchmen, no owners tending vines and figs.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a> pictures similar desolation: &#8220;The cities of Aroer are deserted; they will be left to flocks that lie down.&#8221;<p>- This is not a quaint rural scene; it is a downgrade from cultivated abundance to subsistence grazing. <a href="/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a> laments, &#8220;How the cattle groan!&#8221;&#8212;livestock and land suffer together under covenant curses.<p>- Yet even in judgment God preserves life; the animals&#8217; presence hints at future possibility. Later, <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a> envisions the desert blooming again. The same God who sent devastation promises restoration to all who return to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/7-25.htm">Isaiah 7:25</a> paints a sober picture: fear grips the people, fertile hills grow thorns, and the plow gives way to wandering herds. Each detail affirms that when God&#8217;s word is ignored, prosperity decays into hardship. At the same time, the passage underscores His sovereignty&#8212;He directs nature itself to signal repentance and to prepare the way for eventual renewal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And on all hills that shall be digged . . .</span>--Better, "<span class= "ital">that are digged" </span>or <span class= "ital">that used to be digged with the hoe. </span>The picture of devastation is completed. On the hill-sides, every inch of which was once brought under careful vine culture, "<span class= "ital">Thou wilt not enter for fear of thorns and briars" i.e., </span>thou wilt not venture on the task of tilling the soil in face of such disarrangements. What would be the use of hoeing such a tangled mass of brushwood? At the best it must be left for such pasturage as oxen and sheep might find there as they browsed, and they by their trampling should but increase the mischief. The rendering of the Authorised version conveys the thought that where there was the careful culture thus described, there should be an exception to the general desolation. Below this, if we accept it, there may be a spiritual meaning like that of <a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.">Jeremiah 4:3</a> (Kay).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On all hills that shall be digged</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that shall have been digged in</span> former times, whether for corn cultivation or for any other. <span class="cmt_word">There shall not come thither the fear of briers</span> (so Ewald and Kay).
