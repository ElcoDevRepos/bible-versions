In the context of Isaiah, it serves as a warning to the people of Judah who have turned away from God. Rising early in pursuit of strong drink indicates a lifestyle dominated by indulgence and addiction, suggesting a prioritization of pleasure over spiritual and moral responsibilities. This behavior reflects a deeper spiritual malaise, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a>, which warns against the dangers of excessive drinking. The pursuit of strong drink symbolizes a broader societal decay, where immediate gratification is sought over long-term faithfulness to God.<p><b>who linger into the evening</b><br>Lingering into the evening suggests a continuous, unbroken indulgence in alcohol, highlighting a life consumed by excess. This behavior is indicative of a lack of self-control and discipline, which are virtues extolled throughout Scripture (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed significant value on moderation and self-restraint, as seen in the Nazarite vow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>), which included abstaining from wine. The persistent indulgence from morning to evening underscores a rejection of these values and a descent into moral and spiritual apathy.<p><b>to be inflamed by wine</b><br>Being inflamed by wine suggests a loss of reason and self-control, leading to destructive behavior. This phrase captures the idea of being consumed or controlled by one's desires, a theme echoed in <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, which contrasts being filled with the Spirit with being drunk on wine. The imagery of fire and inflammation can also be seen as a metaphor for judgment, as fire often represents God's purifying and consuming judgment in Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The excessive consumption of wine, leading to a state of being inflamed, serves as a warning against allowing any substance or desire to take precedence over one's devotion to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, representing the Southern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>Those being warned in this passage, specifically those indulging in excessive drinking and neglecting God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_excess.htm">The Dangers of Excess</a></b><br>Isaiah warns against the pursuit of strong drink, highlighting the dangers of excess and addiction.

It carries both grief and warning, much like Jesus&#8217; woes in <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13&#8211;36</a>. When the Lord pronounces a woe, He is not merely expressing displeasure; He is declaring that sin has consequences (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>). Here the target is a specific lifestyle of unchecked indulgence. The seriousness of the word reminds us that the Creator cares deeply about the way His people live (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who rise early in the morning</b><p>The behavior starts at dawn. Instead of greeting the day with praise (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>) or seeking wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17</a>), these people jump straight into self-gratification. Isaiah highlights the priority they give to alcohol, revealing a heart set on pleasure rather than on God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). Early pursuit shows premeditation&#8212;this is not an occasional lapse but a daily habit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in pursuit of strong drink</b><p>&#8220;Strong drink&#8221; refers to fermented beverages beyond simple wine, signaling excessive consumption (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The chase is deliberate: they are &#8220;in pursuit.&#8221; Scripture often contrasts diligent pursuit of righteousness with the reckless chase after sin (<a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>). By pouring time, money, and energy into alcohol, they make it an idol (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>), trading the Holy Spirit&#8217;s fullness for a counterfeit thrill.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who linger into the evening</b><p>The day ends as it began&#8212;under the influence. Lingering suggests long, drawn-out parties that swallow the hours meant for work, worship, and family (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>). Their entire schedule bows to the bottle, echoing the &#8220;days of Noah&#8221; when people &#8220;were eating and drinking&#8221; right up to the flood (<a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38</a>). Persistent indulgence dulls spiritual sensitivity (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be inflamed by wine</b><p>The goal is intoxication. Wine becomes a fire that consumes self-control, leading to moral blindness (<a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>). The Old Testament repeatedly links drunkenness with disgrace&#8212;Noah&#8217;s shame (<a href="/genesis/9-20.htm">Genesis 9:20-24</a>), Lot&#8217;s tragedy (<a href="/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30-38</a>). In contrast, God calls His people to sobriety so they can discern His voice (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a> exposes a life driven by appetite rather than allegiance to God. From sunrise to sunset, the drinker&#8217;s schedule, priorities, and passions revolve around alcohol. The Lord&#8217;s &#8220;woe&#8221; warns that such a path ends in judgment and loss. He invites us instead to seek Him early, walk in His Spirit, and find lasting joy that no cup of wine can match.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Woe unto them that rise up early.</span>--The same class as in <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!">Isaiah 5:8</a> meets us under another aspect.

Not wine only, but the "strong drink" made from honey and from dates and other fruits (possibly including, as a generic term, the beer for which Egypt was famous) was seen on their tables.

(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm" title="But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.">Isaiah 28:7</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that... follow strong drink</span>.

Drunkenness is an infrequent Oriental vice; but it seems to have been one whereto many among the Jews were at all times prone (see <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-32</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, etc.).

Two kinds of intoxicating liquor seem to have been consumed at these banquets, viz. ordinary grape wine, and a much stronger drink, which is said to have been "made of dates, pomegranates, apples, honey, barley, and other ingredients," which was known as <span class="accented">shekar</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and is called "strong drink" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Till wine inflame them</span>;
