It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the following words are not merely human opinion but are divinely inspired. This underscores the importance and weight of the message that follows.<p><b>Heaven is My throne,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty and majesty. The imagery of a throne signifies authority, kingship, and governance. In biblical cosmology, heaven is often depicted as the dwelling place of God, transcending earthly limitations. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>, reinforcing the idea of God's supreme rule over all creation.<p><b>and earth is My footstool.</b><br>The earth as God's footstool conveys His dominion over the physical world. This imagery suggests that while God is transcendent, He is also immanent, having authority over the earth. This concept is found in other biblical passages like <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and <a href="/acts/7-49.htm">Acts 7:49</a>, emphasizing the vastness of God's presence and His control over all creation.<p><b>What kind of house will you build for Me?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the notion that human-made structures can contain or confine God. It reflects the limitations of the temple or any physical building as a dwelling place for the divine. This theme is explored in <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>, where Solomon acknowledges that even the heavens cannot contain God, much less a temple built by human hands.<p><b>Or where will My place of repose be?</b><br>This question further emphasizes God's transcendence and the inadequacy of human efforts to provide a resting place for Him. It suggests that true worship and relationship with God go beyond physical structures. This idea is echoed in <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>, where Jesus speaks of worshiping God in spirit and truth, indicating that God's presence is not confined to any specific location.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, emphasizing His majesty and transcendence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>Described as God's throne, symbolizing His supreme authority and dominion over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>Referred to as God's footstool, indicating His omnipresence and the vastness of His creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Implicitly referenced as the "house" that people might build for God, highlighting the limitations of human efforts to contain the divine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_transcendence_and_immanence.htm">God's Transcendence and Immanence</a></b><br>Recognize that God is both transcendent, ruling from His heavenly throne, and immanent, present in His creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_efforts.htm">The Limitations of Human Efforts</a></b><br>Understand that no human structure or effort can fully encapsulate God's presence or glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship.htm">True Worship</a></b><br>Reflect on the nature of true worship, which is not confined to physical spaces but is a matter of the heart and spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Acknowledge God's sovereignty over all creation, which calls for humility and reverence in our approach to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>Consider how God's majesty and holiness should inspire us to live lives that honor Him, beyond mere ritualistic practices.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_66_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 66:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_66_1_God_s_rule_over_all.htm">How does Isaiah 66:1 emphasize God's sovereignty over heaven and earth?

By placing His throne in heaven, God announces unlimited sovereignty that eclipses any earthly power (see <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>: &#8220;The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The statement is literal&#8212;heaven truly is the seat of God&#8217;s reign&#8212;yet it also communicates relationship: He is above, we are below, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>.<p>&#8226; This heavenly throne shows God&#8217;s availability everywhere, not confined to one nation or building, as Stephen later emphasizes in <a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48&#8211;49</a> when quoting this verse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Earth is My footstool</b><p>&#8226; A footstool belongs to the same occupant as the throne, so earth remains firmly under God&#8217;s authority. <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> paints the picture: &#8220;He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus cites the same truth in <a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34&#8211;35</a>, underscoring that swearing by earth is futile because it is merely &#8220;His footstool.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The imagery assures believers of God&#8217;s intimate supervision of daily life&#8212;nothing on earth lies outside His sovereign reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What kind of house will you build for Me?</b><p>&#8226; The question exposes human limitations. Even Solomon, after constructing the magnificent temple, admitted, &#8220;The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain You&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God instituted the tabernacle and later the temple, yet these were symbols, never confinements. <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a> reiterates, &#8220;The God who made the world&#8230; does not dwell in temples made by human hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By asking, God invites humility: our best efforts at sacred architecture are meaningful only when they recognize His ultimate greatness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where will My place of repose be?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Repose&#8221; points to rest and fellowship.

Buildings matter, but surrendered hearts matter more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a> sets God&#8217;s unparalleled greatness against human finitude. Heaven is His real throne; earth is merely His footstool. No earthly temple can contain Him, yet He graciously engages us, seeking hearts that honor His majesty. The verse calls believers to revere God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty while offering themselves&#8212;not merely structures&#8212;as the true place of His rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>LXVI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">The heaven is my throne . . .</span>--We are left to conjecture the historical starting-point of this utterance of a Divine truth. Was the prophet condemning in advance the restoration of the temple on the return from Babylon, or, as some critics have supposed, the intention of some of the exiles to build a temple in the land of their captivity, as others did afterwards at Leontopolis in Egypt? Was he anticipating the vision of the Apocalypse, that in the new Jerusalem there was to be "no temple" (<a href="/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>)? Neither of these views is satisfactory, <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>, and the writings of Ezekiel, Haggai, Zechariah, all pre-supposing the existence of a new temple. It seems better to see in the words the utterance, in its strongest form, of the truth that God dwelleth, not in temples made with hands, that utterance being compatible, as in the case of Solomon himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-18.htm" title="But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!">2Chronicles 6:18</a>), of our Lord (<a href="/context/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16-17</a>; <a href="/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-23</a>), of St. Stephen, who quoted this passage (<a href="/context/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48-50</a>), with the profoundest reverence for the visible sanctuary. Cheyne quotes a striking parallel from an Egyptian hymn to the Nile of the fourteenth century B.C., in which we find the writer saying of God, <span class= "ital">"</span>His abode is not known <span class= "bld">. . .</span> there is no building that can contain Him." (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iv.</span> 109.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - THE UNGODLY EXILES REBUKED. Israel, being about to return from the Captivity, had the design of rebuilding the temple and re-establishing the temple worship. God rebukes this design in persons devoid of any spirit of holiness, and warns them that mere formal outward worship is an abomination to him (vers. 1-3). In ver. 4 he threatens them with punishment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>). The Hebrews, while they earnestly desired to have a material emblem of the presence of God in their midst, were deeply impressed with the feeling that no temple could be worthy of him, or other than most unworthy. "Will God," said Solomon, "indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?" (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). And again, "Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before trim?" (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>). Thus Isaiah's note of warning was no novelty, and might rind responsive echoes in the hearts of many. <span class="cmt_word">Where is the house that ye build unto me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what manner of house is it that ye would build to me</span>, <span class="accented">add what manner of place for my rest</span>? God needs no "house;" and they cannot build him a house that could be in any way worthy of him. <span class="accented">They</span>, moreover, are unworthy to build him any house, which is the real ground of the refusal. There was no refusal, when the better part of the exiles, having returned, took the building in hand (see <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8-14</a>;
