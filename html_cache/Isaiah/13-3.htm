The "sanctified ones" are those set apart by God for a specific task. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, these are likely the Medes, who were used by God to bring judgment upon Babylon. The term "sanctified" here does not imply moral purity but rather being consecrated for God's use. This reflects the biblical theme that God can use any nation or people to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other instances like Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. The concept of being "commanded" by God underscores His sovereignty over nations and history.<p><b>I have even summoned My warriors</b><br>The "warriors" are those who will carry out God's judgment. Historically, this refers to the Medes and Persians, who conquered Babylon in 539 BC. The summoning of these warriors highlights God's control over historical events and His ability to orchestrate the rise and fall of empires. This aligns with the biblical narrative that God is the ultimate authority over all earthly powers, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons and deposes kings.<p><b>to execute My wrath</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the purpose of the warriors' summoning: to carry out divine judgment. The "wrath" of God is a recurring theme in the Bible, representing His righteous anger against sin and injustice. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, Babylon's pride and idolatry warranted such judgment. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God is just and will not leave sin unpunished, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness.<p><b>and exult in My triumph.</b><br>The final phrase speaks to the outcome of God's judgment: His ultimate victory. The "triumph" is not just the defeat of Babylon but the demonstration of God's power and justice. The exultation of the warriors can be seen as a reflection of God's glory being revealed through His acts of judgment. This anticipates the eschatological victory of God over all evil, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19:1-2</a>, where a great multitude in heaven praises God for His true and just judgments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who commands and summons His chosen instruments for a

Isaiah has already shown God directing the rise and fall of empires (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>; 45:12-13). Here the same sovereign voice that &#8220;spoke, and it came to be&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>) now sends forth forces against Babylon.<p>&#8226; His command is decisive; no one can stay His hand (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; When God speaks, history shifts course (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the timing is His: &#8220;At that time I, the Lord, will make My words in your mouth fire&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My sanctified ones</b><p>&#8220;Sanctified&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean these warriors are spiritually pure; it means they are set apart for God&#8217;s purpose, just as Cyrus is later called &#8220;My shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar &#8220;My servant&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God often uses unexpected instruments&#8212;pagan Medes and Persians in this context (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Their consecration is functional: they carry out a holy assignment of judgment (<a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling them &#8220;My&#8221; sanctified ones, God takes ownership of the mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have even summoned</b><p>The phrase stresses personal involvement: He hasn&#8217;t merely allowed history to unfold; He has actively &#8220;summoned&#8221; the agents of judgment.
