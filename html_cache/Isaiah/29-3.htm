In the context of Isaiah, this is a prophecy against Jerusalem, often referred to as Ariel. The imagery of encampment is reminiscent of military tactics used in ancient warfare, where an army would surround a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This reflects God's sovereignty and control over the events, emphasizing that the impending judgment is orchestrated by Him. The circular encampment signifies total encirclement, leaving no room for escape, symbolizing the completeness of God's judgment.<p><b>I will besiege you with towers</b><br>Siege towers were large, movable structures used in ancient warfare to breach city walls. This phrase suggests an intensification of the siege, indicating that the assault will be relentless and strategic. Historically, siege towers allowed attackers to scale walls and launch projectiles, making them formidable tools of war. The use of such imagery underscores the seriousness of the impending judgment. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual sieges believers face, where God allows trials to refine and strengthen faith.<p><b>and set up siege works against you.</b><br>Siege works refer to the construction of ramps, trenches, and other structures to facilitate an attack on a fortified city. This phrase highlights the methodical and determined nature of the siege. In the historical context of Isaiah, this would resonate with the audience familiar with Assyrian and Babylonian military tactics. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God. The imagery of siege works can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He dismantles the strongholds of evil through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

No avenue of escape remains, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>, where covenant curses warned that disobedience would bring a siege on every city.<p>&#8226; The picture reverses earlier promises of protection, such as <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, &#8220;The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him.&#8221; Because Jerusalem (&#8220;Ariel,&#8221; v. 1) has turned to ritual without obedience (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>), the encamping presence becomes hostile rather than protective.<p>&#8226; Historically, the prophecy anticipated the Assyrian threat in 701 BC (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18&#8211;19</a>) and, more completely, the Babylonian siege of 588-586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-2</a>). God wielded foreign armies as His instrument, yet remained sovereign over every movement (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Theologically, the clause reminds believers that privilege never cancels accountability; when hearts harden, the LORD may surround His own city in judgment before He restores it in mercy (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will besiege you with towers</b><p>&#8220;I will besiege you with towers&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Siege towers were massive, wheeled structures that allowed attackers to scale or breach city walls (<a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>).

Old-Testament prophecy thus cast a long shadow, fulfilled more than once, proving Scripture&#8217;s reliability and God&#8217;s unwavering standard.<p>&#8226; Application: when sin is entrenched, the LORD may bring equally entrenched measures to expose and correct it (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And set up siege works against you</b><p>&#8220;And set up siege works against you&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Siege works&#8221; (ramps, mounds, trenches) speak of patient pressure, wearing the city down over time (<a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; 21:22). The process would starve Jerusalem of supplies and morale, exactly what occurred under Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Every new earthwork was a tangible sign that the window for repentance was closing; yet the LORD still described the coming events beforehand, offering opportunity to turn (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today:<p>&#8211; Persistent sin invites escalating discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s warnings are mercy, calling us to humble ourselves before consequences reach their peak (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even here, hope glimmers. <a href="/bsb/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a> moves from siege to sudden deliverance (vv. 5-8) and spiritual awakening (vv. 17-24), showing that judgment is a step toward redemption, not the final word (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a> pictures the LORD Himself surrounding Jerusalem, directing a full-scale siege complete with towers and earthworks. The clause-by-clause buildup emphasizes His total control, the certainty of judgment on unrepentant religion, and the historic accuracy of prophecy fulfilled in both Babylonian and later Roman assaults.

There was small chance of forcing an entrance into Jerusalem on any side except the north; but, order to distress and harass her, an enemy with numerous forces would dispose them all round the walls, thus preventing all ingress or egress (see <a href="/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And... lay siege against thee with a mount</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a mound</span>.
