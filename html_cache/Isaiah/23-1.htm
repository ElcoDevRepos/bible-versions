Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its wealth and maritime power. The prophecy against Tyre signifies a divine judgment against its pride and reliance on material wealth. Tyre's significance in trade and commerce made it a symbol of worldly prosperity, which often led to spiritual complacency and idolatry.<p><b>Wail, O ships of Tarshish:</b><br>Tarshish is often identified with a distant trading partner, possibly in the western Mediterranean, such as Spain. The ships of Tarshish represent the extensive trade network that Tyre was part of. The call to wail indicates the economic impact and distress that Tyre's downfall would have on its trading partners. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of ancient economies and the far-reaching consequences of Tyre's destruction.<p><b>For Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor:</b><br>The prophecy foretells the complete devastation of Tyre, emphasizing the loss of its homes and its critical role as a harbor city. Historically, Tyre was known for its strong fortifications and its island city, which made it difficult to conquer. However, this prophecy indicates that even such a formidable city would not escape divine judgment. The destruction of its harbor would cripple its economy and influence.<p><b>Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus:</b><br>Cyprus, an island in the eastern Mediterranean, was a significant location in the trade routes of the ancient world. The mention of Cyprus suggests that news of Tyre's destruction would spread quickly across the region, affecting all who were connected to its trade.

These we learn, partly from Scripture itself, partly from Assyrian inscriptions. In the days of David and Solomon there had been an intimate alliance between Israel and Hiram, King of Tyre. <a href="/psalms/45-12.htm" title="And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.">Psalm 45:12</a> indicates at least the interchange of kingly gifts, if not the acknowledgment of sovereignty by payment of tribute. <a href="/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a>, which we have some reason to connect with the reign of Uzziah, shows that this alliance had passed into hostility. The position of Tyre naturally threw it into more intimate relations with the northern kingdom; "its country was nourished by the king's country" then as in the days of Herod Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>), and there seems reason to believe that the son of Tabeal, whom Pekah and Rezin intended to place upon the throne of Judah, was the son of a Tyrian ruler. (See Note on <a href="/isaiah/7-6.htm" title="Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the middle of it, even the son of Tabeal:">Isaiah 7:6</a>.) It was, at this time, the most flourishing of the Ph?nician cities, and had succeeded to the older fame of Zidon. The action of Ahaz in inviting the help of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and the Syrians had tended to make Tyre also an object of attack by the Assyrian armies. The prophecy now before us would seem to have been connected with that attack, and foretells the issue of the conflict on which Tyre had rashly entered. Upon that issue light is thrown by the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. Sargon records that he "plundered the district of Samaria and the whole house of Omri," and "reigned from Yatnan (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea of the setting sun <span class= "bld">. . .</span> from the great Ph?nicia and Syria<span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">. </span>to all the cities of remote Media" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 27). Sennacherib boasts of a victory over the land of the Hatti (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Hittites); "fear overwhelmed Luti, the king of Zidon," and "he fled to Yatnan, which is in the midst of the sea," and the Assyrian "placed Tubalu" (the Tabeal of Isaiah) on the throne of the kingdom (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 61). In anticipation of these events, the prophet utters his note of warning to the great merchant city. It seems more natural to connect it with those events, which came within the horizon of his vision, than to refer it, as some interpreters have done, to the later siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. The mention of the Chaldeans as having been subdued by the Assyrians, which fits in with Sargon's and Sennacherib's victories over Merodach-baladan (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 45, 59), who endeavoured to establish an independent kingdom in Babylon (see Note on <a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>), and is, of course, entirely inapplicable to the time of Nebuchadnezzar, seems, indeed, to be decisive as to this question. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - THE BURDEN OF TYRE. We here reach the last of the "burdens" - the concluding chapter of the series of denunciatory prophecies which commenced with <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. It is an elegy "in three stanzas, or strophes" (Cheyne) - the first extending from ver. 1 to ver. 5; the second, thence to ver. 9; and the third from ver. 10 to ver. 14. An undertone of sadness, and even of commiseration, prevails throughout it, the prophet viewing Tyre as a fellow-sufferer with Israel, persecuted and oppressed by the fame enemy, Assyria, which was everywhere pushing her conquests, and had recently extended her dominion even over Babylon (ver. 13). This last allusion fixes the date of the prophecy to a time subsequent to <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, when the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, first conquered the country, and took the title of king (G. Smith, 'Epanym Canon,' p. 86). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, 31). The expression is common in the prophets (see <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>, etc.: <a href="/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-2.htm">Ezekiel 30:2</a>; <a href="/joel/1-5.htm">Joel 1:5, 11, 13</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye ships of Tarshish</span>. "Ships of Tarshish" are first mentioned in connection with the trade carried on by Solomon. Apparently, the term there designates a certain class of ship rather than those engaged in a particular trade (see the comment on 1 Kings 22:48 in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 2. p. 623). Here, however, Phoenician ships, actually engaged in the trade with Tartessus, may be intended. Tartessus was a very ancient Phoenician settlement in the south of Spain, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and was the center of a most important and lucrative commerce (see <a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; Herod., i. 163; <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, etc.). In the present passage the returning fleet of merchantmen is addressed, and told that the harbour to which they are hastening is closed, the city desolate. <span class="cmt_word">From the land of Chittim</span>. "Chittim" here, as in <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>, and elsewhere <span class="accented">generally</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> probably Cyprus, whose most ancient capital was called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Kitten</span> (see Joseph, 'Ant. Jud,' 1:6, &sect; 1). The name "Chittim" is not improbably a variant of "Khittim," "the Hittites," who may have been the first to colonize the island. A fleet from the Western Mediterranean would naturally touch at Cyprus on its way to Tyro, and would there learn the calamity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/23-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[This is] an oracle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4853.htm">Strong's 4853: </a> </span><span class="str2">A burden, tribute, porterage, an utterance, chiefly a, doom, singing, mental, desire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">concerning Tyre:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1465;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6865.htm">Strong's 6865: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tyre -- a Phoenician city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Wail,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;
