In the prophetic tradition, such declarations are often used to convey divine judgment or promise. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) underscores the covenantal relationship between God and His people, highlighting His sovereignty over all nations, including Moab.<p><b>In three years</b><br>The specific timeframe indicates the immediacy and certainty of the prophecy. The use of a precise period suggests that the events are imminent and unavoidable. This timeframe is reminiscent of other prophetic timelines in Scripture, such as the three days of Jonah in the belly of the fish, symbolizing a period of waiting or impending change.<p><b>as a hired worker counts the years</b><br>This comparison to a hired worker suggests precision and exactness, as a laborer would meticulously track time to ensure proper payment. It implies that the prophecy will be fulfilled exactly as stated, without delay or extension, reflecting God's control over time and events.<p><b>Moab&#8217;s splendor will become an object of contempt</b><br>Moab, a neighboring nation of Israel, was often in conflict with Israel. Known for its wealth and pride, Moab's "splendor" refers to its prosperity and cultural achievements. The prophecy foretells a reversal of fortune, where Moab's glory will turn to shame. This echoes themes of divine judgment against pride found throughout the Bible, such as in the fall of Babylon (Isaiah 13-14).<p><b>with all her many people</b><br>This phrase highlights the extent of the judgment, affecting the entire population of Moab. It underscores the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, which spares no one. The mention of "many people" also reflects Moab's once-great population and influence, which will be drastically reduced.<p><b>And those who are left will be few and feeble</b><br>The prophecy concludes with a stark image of desolation. The survivors will be "few and feeble," indicating a significant reduction in numbers and strength. This outcome serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and opposition to God's will. It parallels other biblical accounts of remnant theology, where a small, weakened group remains after divine judgment, such as the remnant of Israel after the Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, declaring His judgment and plans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message.

Isaiah is authorized to announce that in three years' time, counted as strictly as possible, the judgment pronounced shall fall on Moab; her "glory" shall be turned into shame, her "multitude" shall be cut off, and only a "remnant" shall be left, weak, small, and powerless. <span class="cmt_word">As the years of an hireling</span>. Counted with the utmost exactness. A hireling would not consent to serve a day longer than his contract bound him, nor would his master consent that he should serve a day short of it. <span class="cmt_word">With all that great multitude.</span> We have no means of accurately estimating the population of Moab. The entire area of the region which the Moabites inhabited seems to have been not more than fifteen hundred square miles. The greater part of it was, however, exceedingly fertile; and we are, perhaps, justified in allowing it a population of two hundred to the square mile, which is about that of Germany. This would give three hundred thousand inhabitants, of whom the adult males would be seventy-five thousand. <span class="cmt_word">Feeble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">not powerful</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> very much the contrary, very weak. Moab seems to have offered a very slight resistance to Asshur-bani-pal (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 259). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
