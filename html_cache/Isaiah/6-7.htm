The altar in the temple was a place of sacrifice and atonement, symbolizing purification and cleansing. The act of touching Isaiah's mouth signifies the purification of his speech and his readiness to speak God's words. This moment is a divine commissioning, similar to the calling of other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>), where God touches the prophet's mouth to equip them for their mission.<p><b>and said: &#8220;Now that this has touched your lips,</b><br>The lips are symbolic of speech and communication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the mouth and lips were often seen as the instruments of prophecy. The touching of Isaiah's lips signifies a transformation and preparation for his prophetic role. This act is reminiscent of the purification rituals in the temple, where contact with holy objects was believed to impart holiness and readiness for service.<p><b>your iniquity is removed</b><br>Iniquity refers to moral impurity or sin. The removal of iniquity is a central theme in the Old Testament, often associated with the sacrificial system where offerings were made to atone for sin. This phrase indicates a divine act of forgiveness and cleansing, preparing Isaiah to stand in God's presence and serve as His messenger. It echoes the promise of forgiveness found in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes transgressions from His people.<p><b>and your sin is atoned for.&#8221;</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through a sacrificial act. In the Old Testament, atonement was achieved through the shedding of blood, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. This phrase foreshadows the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross provides the final and complete atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). Isaiah's experience here prefigures the cleansing and redemption available through Christ, highlighting the continuity of God's redemptive plan throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives a vision of the Lord in the temple.

As in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, where the LORD &#8220;touched my mouth,&#8221; this touch signifies divine commissioning.<p>&#8226; Fire both purifies and empowers (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The same God who burns away impurity also ignites a life for service.<p>&#8226; Isaiah had just confessed, &#8220;I am a man of unclean lips&#8221; (v 5). The touch lands exactly where he felt most unworthy, showing God deals specifically with our confessed sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now that this has touched your lips</b><p>&#8226; The focus on lips is intentional: Isaiah&#8217;s future ministry will depend on speaking God&#8217;s words (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; When God cleanses, the very area once dominated by sin becomes an instrument for His glory&#8212;compare <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>, &#8220;O Lord, open my lips.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verb tense stresses a completed act. Like <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>, forgiveness is granted the moment God applies His remedy.<p>&#8226; Personal contact matters. A coal from the altar is powerful, yet nothing changes until it &#8220;touches&#8221; Isaiah. Salvation is never merely theoretical (<a href="/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your iniquity is removed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Removed&#8221; means taken away, not just overlooked. <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a> pictures our sins cast as far as east from west; <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a> shows God hurling them into the depths of the sea.<p>&#8226; Guilt no longer clings to Isaiah; he is free to stand in God&#8217;s holy presence and later to declare judgment on Judah without hypocrisy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> reveals the ultimate fulfillment: &#8220;The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.&#8221; The coal foreshadows the Lamb.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your sin is atoned for</b><p>&#8226; Atonement satisfies God&#8217;s justice and restores fellowship. <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> teaches that &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood&#8230; it is the blood that makes atonement.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This single word bridges <a href="/bsb/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a> with <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where the Suffering Servant is &#8220;pierced for our transgressions.&#8221; The coal prefigures the cross&#8212;both originate from God&#8217;s altar of sacrifice.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a> says Christ entered the Most Holy Place &#8220;once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.&#8221; Isaiah&#8217;s momentary cleansing points to that once-for-all work.<p>&#8226; With sin covered, Isaiah can answer God&#8217;s call in v 8. Cleansing precedes commissioning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Isaiah&#8217;s vision moves from conviction to cleansing to calling. A live coal from God&#8217;s altar touches the prophet&#8217;s unclean lips, showing that holy fire both purifies and equips. The specific sin he confessed is forgiven; his guilt is removed; atonement is applied. This scene anticipates the perfect sacrifice of Christ, who forever takes away sin and qualifies His people to speak for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he laid it upon my mouth.</span>--So Jehovah "touched the mouth" of Isaiah's great successor (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm" title="Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth.

That prophet, like Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>), had felt only or chiefly the want of power ("Alas!
