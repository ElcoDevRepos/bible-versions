It reflects the idea of a divine courtroom where all nations are summoned before God. Historically, this can be seen as a challenge to the surrounding nations and their gods, emphasizing the sovereignty of the God of Israel over all peoples. The gathering of nations is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, often associated with judgment or the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>Who among them can declare this, and proclaim to us the former things?</b><br>Here, God challenges the nations to demonstrate their ability to predict or explain past events, a task that only the true God can accomplish. This highlights the impotence of idols and false gods, contrasting them with the omniscience of the God of Israel. The "former things" may refer to past prophecies or historical acts of God, underscoring His control over history. This challenge is similar to the one found in <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-23</a>, where God calls the idols to prove their divinity by predicting the future.<p><b>Let them present their witnesses to vindicate them,</b><br>This phrase invites the nations to bring forth evidence or testimony to support their claims of divine power. In the ancient Near Eastern context, legal proceedings often involved witnesses to establish truth. The call for witnesses underscores the legal and covenantal aspects of God's relationship with Israel, as seen in Deuteronomy and other covenantal texts. It also foreshadows the role of Israel as God's witness to the nations, a theme further developed in <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>.<p><b>so that others may hear and say, &#8220;It is true.&#8221;</b><br>The ultimate goal of this divine challenge is to lead others to acknowledge the truth of God's sovereignty and the futility of idol worship. This reflects the missional aspect of Israel's calling, to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The acknowledgment of truth by others points to the universal recognition of God's authority, a theme that resonates with the New Testament vision of every knee bowing to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_peoples.htm">Nations and Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to all the different ethnic groups and countries of the world.

"Exhibit the past history of the world in well-attested documents" (Kay); "Make mention of past events which they have correctly foretold" (Cheyne, Delitzsch). According to the former rendering, the contrast is between the solemn, serious <span class="accented">history</span> of early times in Genesis, and the grotesque and extravagant myths, in which the nations generally embodied their views of the primitive ages. (For a specimen of the contrast, see 'Aids to Faith,' Essay 6. pp. 275, 276.) <span class="cmt_word">Let them bring forth their witnesses</span>. Witnesses that the prophecies were really delivered before the events happened, or that the accounts of past times are such as have really come down to them from their ancestors. <span class="cmt_word">Or let them hear and say, It is truth</span>. It is uncertain whether we ought to translate the initial <span class="accented">vau</span> here by "and" or by "or." If the former, the sense is, "And then let them (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the witnesses) give ear to the assertions made, and declare them true;" if the latter, we may render, with Dr. Kay, "Or, if they have no witnesses, let them listen to the sacred records, and confess them to be <span class="accented">the truth."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/43-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1460;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
