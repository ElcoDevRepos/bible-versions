In the Old Testament, being called by God's name signifies belonging to Him and being under His protection and authority. This is seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God refers to His people as those "called by My name." It reflects the covenant relationship established with Israel, where they are identified as God's chosen people. In the New Testament, this concept extends to all believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>, where the disciples were first called Christians, indicating their identity in Christ.<p><b>and created for My glory</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose of creation, which is to glorify God. The idea that humanity is created for God's glory is a central theme in Scripture. In <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, humans are made in the image of God, reflecting His character and attributes. The Westminster Shorter Catechism echoes this by stating that man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. This purpose is not limited to Israel but extends to all creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God. The ultimate fulfillment of this purpose is found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly glorified the Father (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>).<p><b>whom I have indeed formed and made.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and intentionality in creation. The use of "formed" and "made" suggests a deliberate and careful act of creation, reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust of the ground. It conveys the idea of a potter shaping clay, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, where God is the potter and we are the clay. This imagery emphasizes God's authority and craftsmanship. The repetition of "formed" and "made" also reinforces the certainty and completeness of God's creative work. In the New Testament, this concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are described as God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, emphasizing His sovereignty and purpose in creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Isaiah's prophecy, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God forming and making individuals for His glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile_and_restoration.htm">Exile and Restoration</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43</a>, where God promises to redeem and restore His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity.htm">Understanding Our Identity</a></b><br>Recognize that being "called by My name" signifies a deep, personal relationship with God.
