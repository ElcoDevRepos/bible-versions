The term "woe" is often used in prophetic literature to pronounce judgment or lamentation. Here, Isaiah pronounces it upon himself, recognizing his unworthiness. This moment reflects the common biblical theme of human inadequacy before divine perfection, as seen in other encounters with God, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and Peter's reaction to Jesus' miracle (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p><b>because I am a man of unclean lips</b><br>Isaiah acknowledges his sinfulness, specifically focusing on his speech. In the biblical context, the lips represent what comes from the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). Isaiah's confession highlights the importance of purity in speech, a theme echoed in <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, where the tongue is described as a fire. This acknowledgment of impurity is crucial for understanding the need for divine cleansing and forgiveness.<p><b>dwelling among a people of unclean lips;</b><br>Isaiah not only confesses his own sin but also identifies with the sinfulness of his people, Israel. This reflects the communal aspect of sin in the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals affect the entire community (Joshua 7). The phrase underscores the pervasive nature of sin and the need for national repentance, a recurring theme in the prophetic books.<p><b>for my eyes have seen the King,</b><br>Isaiah's vision of God as King emphasizes His sovereignty and majesty. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kingship was associated with authority and power. This vision contrasts earthly kings with the divine King, highlighting God's ultimate authority. The recognition of God as King is a central theme in the Bible, pointing to the future reign of Christ as King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>the LORD of Hosts.&#8221;</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's command over the heavenly armies, signifying His omnipotence and supreme authority. This title is used frequently in the Old Testament to emphasize God's power and ability to execute judgment and deliverance. It connects to the New Testament portrayal of Christ leading the heavenly armies (<a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>), reinforcing the continuity of God's sovereign rule throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

So Moses "hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God" (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6</a>). So Job "abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes" (<a href="/job/42-6.htm" title="Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.">Job 42:6</a>). So Peter fell down at his Lord's feet, and cried, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord" (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>). Man at such a time feels his nothingness in the presence of the Eternal, his guilt in the presence of the All-holy. No man can see God and live. (Comp. also <a href="/1_samuel/6-20.htm" title="And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?">1Samuel 6:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I am a man of unclean lips.</span>--The prophet's words present at once a parallel and a contrast to those of Moses in <a href="/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>. The Lawgiver feels only, or chiefly, his want of the <span class= "ital">gift </span>of utterance which was needed for his work. With Isaiah the dominant thought is that his lips have been defiled by past sins of speech. How can he join in the praises of the seraphim with those lips from which have so often come bitter and hasty words, formal and ceremonial prayers? (Comp. <a href="/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.">James 3:2</a>; <a href="/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">James 3:9</a>). His lips are "unclean" like those of one stricken, as Uzziah had been, by leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>). He finds no comfort in the thought that others are as bad as he is, that he "dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips." Were it otherwise, there might be some hope that influence from without might work his purification. As it is, he and his people seem certain to sink into the abyss. To "have seen the King, the Lord of hosts," was in such a case simply overwhelming (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - THE SEQUEL OF THE VISION - THE PROPHET'S SENSE OF UNWORTHINESS. The vision of God in this life, whether natural or ecstatic, cannot but produce in the beholder a deep feeling of his unworthiness. God "is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;" even "the heavens are not clean in his sight" (<a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>). Man, being never wholly purged from sin while on earth, cannot but shrink from contact with the absolutely Holy. Hence Isaiah's cry (ver. 5); and hence, to comfort him, the symbolic action of the seraph (ver. 6) and his encouraging words (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am undone</span>; literally, <span class="accented">cut off</span>, <span class="accented">destroyed</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5, 6</a>, etc.). God once said himself, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). Men expected to die even when they had seen angels of God (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22, 23</a>; <a href="/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>). How we are to reconcile <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> with this passage, <a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>, is uncertain. Perhaps the <span class="accented">ecstatic</span> sight was not included in the "<span class="accented">seeing"</span> <span class="accented">of</span> which God spoke to Moses. <span class="cmt_word">I am a man of unclean lips.</span> A man must be indeed" perfect" never to offend in word (<a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). Isaiah felt that he had often so offended. His lips were not "<span class="accented">clean"</span> in God's sight, and if not his lips, then not his heart; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</span> Men catch up the phraseology of their time, and use wrong forms of speech, because they hear them daily.
