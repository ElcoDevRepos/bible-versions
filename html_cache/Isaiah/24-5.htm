The concept of defilement is rooted in the Old Testament, where purity laws were central to maintaining holiness (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>). The defilement here is not just physical but spiritual, suggesting a departure from God's intended order. The earth, created good by God (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), suffers because of human sin, echoing the curse of <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>. This defilement is a result of humanity's collective sin, affecting the land itself, a theme also seen in <a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-3</a>.<p><b>they have transgressed the laws;</b><br>Transgression of the laws refers to the violation of God's commandments. In the context of Isaiah, this can be seen as a reference to the Mosaic Law given to Israel, which was meant to guide them in righteousness (<a href="/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1-2</a>). The laws were not just legalistic rules but were intended to reflect God's character and maintain a covenant relationship with Him. The transgression indicates a willful rebellion against divine authority, similar to the sin of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This rebellion is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel's failure to uphold the law leads to judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a>).<p><b>they have overstepped the decrees</b><br>Overstepping decrees suggests a deliberate crossing of boundaries set by God. Decrees can be understood as divine ordinances or statutes that were meant to govern human behavior. This phrase implies a conscious decision to ignore or reject God's established order. The imagery of overstepping is akin to trespassing, which in biblical terms, is a serious offense against God's holiness. This is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's decrees.<p><b>and broken the everlasting covenant.</b><br>The everlasting covenant likely refers to the covenant God made with humanity, which includes the Noahic, Abrahamic, and Mosaic covenants. These covenants were meant to establish a relationship between God and His people, with promises and obligations. Breaking the covenant signifies a breach of trust and faithfulness, leading to divine judgment. The concept of an everlasting covenant is significant, as it points to God's unchanging nature and His desire for a perpetual relationship with His creation. This breach is a precursor to the new covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with the authorship of the Book of Isaiah.

The verse is a sober diagnosis of universal rebellion, but it also nudges us toward the hope of the covenant God Himself will keep&#8212;fulfilled in Christ, who alone can cleanse a defiled world and restore creation to its intended glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The earth also is defiled.</span>--The verb is used of blood-guiltiness in <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm" title="So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.">Numbers 35:33</a>, of impurity in <a href="/context/jeremiah/3-1.htm" title="They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm" title="And it came to pass through the lightness of her prostitution, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.">Jeremiah 3:9</a>. It includes, therefore, all the sins that, in modern phrase, desecrate humanity.

Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-13</a>). The earth is "defiled" or "polluted" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. <span class="cmt_word">They have transgressed the laws</span>. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The "law written in their hearts" (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the "law written in the heart" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, <span class="accented">broken</span>, <span class="accented">violated</span>. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>); but it seems better to understand that "everlasting covenant" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science.
