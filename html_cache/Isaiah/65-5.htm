In the context of Isaiah, this attitude is indicative of the religious hypocrisy prevalent among the Israelites. The phrase echoes the Pharisaical mindset criticized by Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in passages like <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>, where the Pharisee boasts of his righteousness. The cultural context of ancient Israel included a strong emphasis on ritual purity, which some individuals misinterpreted as a means to elevate themselves above others. This attitude is contrary to the humility and repentance that God desires, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>Such people are smoke in My nostrils,</b><br>This metaphor illustrates God's irritation and displeasure with the self-righteous. Smoke in the nostrils is an image of something unpleasant and irritating, suggesting that such attitudes are offensive to God. The imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God expresses His disdain for empty rituals and insincere worship, such as in <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>. The historical context of Isaiah's time involved a society that often engaged in idolatry and superficial religious practices, which God found detestable.<p><b>a fire that burns all day long.</b><br>The continuous burning fire symbolizes God's enduring anger and judgment against hypocrisy and pride. Fire is frequently used in the Bible as a symbol of purification and judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. This imagery underscores the seriousness of God's response to sin and the need for genuine repentance. The prophetic nature of Isaiah's message points to the ultimate judgment and purification that will come through Jesus Christ, who calls for true worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

In the immediate context (<a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2-4</a>) He has &#8220;spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people&#8221; who pursue idolatry and ritual impurity. Yet even while living in open sin, they still speak pious words. <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> notes the same hypocrisy: &#8220;These people draw near with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.&#8221; Jesus echoes this assessment in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a> when confronting Pharisaic tradition. The phrase reminds us that words alone do not impress the Lord; He weighs the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Keep to yourself</b><p>The first demand reveals a spirit of exclusion. Instead of welcoming fellowship, these people erect barriers, implying others are unfit to approach. In <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a> the self-righteous Pharisee prays, &#8220;God, I thank You that I am not like other men.&#8221; Pride always creates distance. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction,&#8221; a truth vividly displayed here: those who insist others keep away are actually separating themselves from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not come near me</b><p>The command deepens the divide. It is a deliberate act of shunning, suggesting that contact would somehow defile the speaker. Ironically, in <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a> it is the leper&#8212;ceremonially unclean&#8212;who must cry, &#8220;Unclean! Unclean!&#8221; and dwell outside the camp. Here the roles are reversed: spiritually unclean people act as though they are clean, while labeling others as impure. <a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a> urges believers, &#8220;Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly,&#8221; the very opposite posture of Isaiah&#8217;s rebels.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I am holier than you!</b><p>This bold claim exposes the root issue: self-made righteousness. Instead of relying on God&#8217;s mercy, they measure holiness by external ritual and comparison. <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a> contrasts such pride with the tax collector&#8217;s humble plea for mercy; only the humble man is justified. <a href="/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a> speaks of Israel &#8220;seeking to establish their own righteousness&#8221; and, by doing so, refusing to submit to God&#8217;s righteousness. True holiness is God-given, not self-proclaimed (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such people are smoke in My nostrils</b><p>God&#8217;s reaction is vivid: continual irritation, like smoke that stings and waters the eyes. <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a> pictures His nostrils kindled by unrighteousness, underscoring that sin offends His holiness. <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-23</a> records a similar sentiment toward hypocritical worship: &#8220;I despise your feasts&#8230; I will not accept them.&#8221; What humans may consider minor religious pride, the Lord regards as an acrid provocation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A fire that burns all day long</b><p>The imagery moves from irritation to sustained anger. His displeasure is not a passing moment; unrepentant pride keeps the divine wrath burning. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a> says, &#8220;A fire is kindled in My anger and burns to the depths of Sheol.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a> affirms, &#8220;Our God is a consuming fire.&#8221; The continual nature (&#8220;all day long&#8221;) reminds us that persistent sin invites persistent judgment until repentance occurs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a> exposes a people steeped in religious pride: they verbally separate themselves, claim superior holiness, and reject fellowship. God labels their attitude an unbearable irritant that kindles His sustained anger. True holiness is humble, God-centered, and welcoming; self-righteous isolation provokes divine judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/65.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Which say, Stand by thyself . . .</span>--The picture, in its main outlines, reminds us of the proud exclusiveness of the later Pharisees, and the root-evil is, of course, identical. Here, however, the ground of the exclusiveness is not the consciousness of the peculiar privileges of Israel, but rests on what was an actual apostasy. Those of whom Isaiah speaks boasted of their initiation into heathen mysteries (Baal, Thammuz, or the like) as giving them a kind of consecrated character, and separating them from the <span class= "ital">profanum vulgus </span>of the Israelites, who were faithful to the God of their fathers.<p><span class= "bld">I am holier than thou.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I am holy to thee: i.e., one </span>whom thou mayest not approach. (Comp. <a href="/leviticus/21-8.htm" title="You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.">Leviticus 21:8</a>.) By some commentators the verb is taken as transitive, I <span class= "ital">make thee holy: i.e., </span>have power to impart holiness; but this is less satisfactory, both grammatically and as to meaning.<p><span class= "bld">These are a smoke in my nose . . .</span>--The point of the clause is that the punishment is represented as not future. The self-exalting idolaters are already as those who are being consumed in the fire of the Divine wrath, and their smoke is "a savour of death" in the nostrils of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stand by thyself</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "keep aloof - come not into contact with me; for mine is a higher holiness than thine, and I should be polluted by thy near approach." Initiation into heathen mysteries was thought to confer on the initiated a holiness unattainable otherwise. Thus the heathenized Jew claimed to be holier than the true servants of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">These are a smoke... a fire</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>, "There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it").
