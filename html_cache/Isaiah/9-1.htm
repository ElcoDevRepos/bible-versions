The context is the Assyrian invasion, which brought great distress to the northern tribes of Israel. The promise of "no more gloom" indicates a future restoration and deliverance. This is a message of hope for those who have suffered under oppression, pointing to a time when God's light will dispel darkness.<p><b>In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,</b><br>Zebulun and Naphtali were among the first regions to suffer from the Assyrian conquest due to their geographical location in the northern part of Israel. The "humbling" refers to the devastation and subjugation they experienced. Historically, these lands were often the first to face foreign invasions, making them symbolic of Israel's suffering. This humbling is a result of Israel's disobedience and turning away from God.<p><b>but in the future He will honor the Way of the Sea,</b><br>The "Way of the Sea" refers to a major trade route that passed through Galilee, connecting Egypt to Mesopotamia. This route was significant for commerce and cultural exchange. The promise to "honor" this area suggests a reversal of fortune, where a region once marked by humiliation will become a place of significance and blessing. This is seen as a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah, who would bring honor to this region.<p><b>beyond the Jordan,</b><br>This phrase indicates the geographical area east of the Jordan River, which was part of the territory of Israel. It highlights the extent of the restoration and blessing that will come, reaching even those areas that were traditionally seen as less central to Israel's identity. This expansion of honor and blessing signifies the inclusive nature of God's future work.<p><b>Galilee of the nations:</b><br>Galilee was known for its diverse population, including many Gentiles, hence the term "Galilee of the nations." This multicultural aspect made it a place of mixed heritage and influence. The prophecy points to Galilee as the starting point of Jesus' ministry, fulfilling the promise of bringing light to a region once in darkness. This also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the salvation plan, as Jesus' ministry would reach beyond the Jewish people to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulun_and_naphtali.htm">Zebulun and Naphtali</a></b><br>These were two of the twelve tribes of Israel, located in the northern region.

That version is, however, so obscure as to be almost unintelligible, and requires an entire remodelling:--<span class= "ital">Surely there is no gloom to her that was afflicted. In the former time he brought shame on the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter he bringeth honour on the way by the sea, beyond Jordan, the circuit of the Gentiles.</span><p>The prophet had seen in the closing verses of Isaiah 8 the extreme point of misery. That picture, as it were, dissolves, and another takes its place. She that was afflicted, the whole land of Israel, should have no more affliction. The future should be in striking contrast with the past. The lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, the region afterwards known as the Upper and Lower Galilee, had been laid waste and spoiled by Tiglath-pilneser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>). That same region, described by the prophet in different terms (the former representing the tribal divisions, the latter the geographical) is hereafter to be the scene of a glory greater than Israel had ever known before.<p><span class= "bld">The way of the sea . . .</span>--The context shows that the "sea" is that which appears in Bible history under the names of the sea of Chinnereth (<a href="/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm" title="The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>), the Sea of Galilee, the Sea of Tiberias (<a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>), Gennesaret (<a href="/mark/6-53.htm" title="And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.">Mark 6:53</a>). The high road thence to Damascus was known as <span class= "ital">Via Maris </span>in the time of the Crusaders (Renan, quoted by Cheyne). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7</span> - THE TROUBLES OF ISRAEL SHALL END THROUGH THE BIRTH OF A MARVELOUS CHILD. The section of the prophecy commencing with <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> terminates in this glorious burst of glad and gracious promise. The gist of the whole section is: "Israel shall not suffer from Pekah and Rezin; her oppressors shall be Assyria and Egypt, more especially the former; Assyria shall overwhelm her, crush her, lay her low; she shall remain awhile in gloom and darkness; but at length the darkness shall be dispelled; a 'great light' shall shine forth, first in the north, then over all the land; 'the rod of the oppressor' shall be broken; a Child shall be born, who shall bear marvelous names, and shall rule over the full kingdom of David in justice and righteousness forever." God has spoken, and God will perform this. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation</span>, <span class="cmt_word">when</span>, etc. Our translators have misconceived the construction, and consequently missed the sense. The first two clauses, which they run together, are entirely separate and distinct. Translate, <span class="accented">Nevertheless there shall be no</span> (<span class="accented">more</span>) <span class="accented">darkness to her who was in affliction</span>. <span class="accented">As at the former time he brought contempt upon the land of Zebulon</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. Contempt was brought on the more northern part of the Holy Land, first when it was overrun and ravaged by the Syrians (<a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) under Ben-hadad, and more recently when it bore the brunt of the Assyrian attack (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) under Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">At the first... and afterward</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the former time</span>... <span class="accented">in the latter time</span>. The contrast is between two periods of Israel's history, the existing period and the Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And afterward did more grievously afflict her</span>. This is altogether wrong. Translate, <span class="accented">So in the latter time he hath brought honor on the way of the sea</span>. The perfect is a "prophetic perfect," and the reference is to the honor that would be done to the northern districts, "the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali," by the Messiah dwelling there (comp. <a href="/matthew/4-14.htm">Matthew 4:14-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The way of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district about the sea of Tiberias, called "the sea of Kinnereth" (equivalent to "Gennesareth") in <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, and "the sea of Galilee" in <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tract east of the sea and of the upper Jordan, where the five thousand were fed, and where our Lord was transfigured. <span class="cmt_word">Galilee of the nations</span>. The name "Galilee" seems to have been given to the outlying circuit, or zone, on the north, which was debatable ground between the Israelites and their neighbors (see <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>). The word means "circuit," or "ring." Though claimed as theirs by the Israelites, it was largely peopled by "Gentiles." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there will be no more</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gloom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1464;&#1507;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#363;&#183;&#8216;&#257;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4155.htm">Strong's 4155: </a> </span><span class="str2">Covered, dark, obscurity, distress</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
