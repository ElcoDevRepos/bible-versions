In the context of Isaiah, Babylon is often seen as a symbol of pride and idolatry. The swift nature of the judgment reflects the biblical theme that God's justice can be executed unexpectedly and decisively. This mirrors the sudden fall of Babylon as described in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>, where the kingdom is overthrown in a single night.<p><b>loss of children, and widowhood:</b><br>These terms symbolize complete devastation and loss. In ancient cultures, children and marriage were seen as blessings and sources of security and legacy. The loss of children and becoming a widow would represent the ultimate form of desolation and vulnerability. This imagery is used to convey the totality of Babylon's downfall, as also seen in <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7-8</a>, where Babylon's pride leads to her destruction.<p><b>They will come upon you in full measure:</b><br>The phrase "in full measure" indicates the completeness and thoroughness of the judgment. It suggests that the punishment will be proportionate to the sins committed. This concept of divine retribution is consistent with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, where actions have corresponding consequences.<p><b>in spite of your many sorceries and the potency of your spells:</b><br>Babylon was renowned for its practices in magic and sorcery, which were common in ancient Mesopotamian culture. These practices were attempts to control or predict the future, often in defiance of God's sovereignty. The mention of sorceries and spells highlights the futility of relying on human wisdom and power against divine judgment. This echoes the biblical condemnation of such practices in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, where sorcery is forbidden as it leads people away from trusting in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire addressed in this chapter, known for its pride, idolatry, and sorcery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sorceries_and_spells.htm">Sorceries and Spells</a></b><br>Practices of magic and divination that Babylon relied upon, which God condemns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/loss_of_children_and_widowhood.htm">Loss of Children and Widowhood</a></b><br>Metaphors for the complete devastation and loss that Babylon will experience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_day.htm">Judgment Day</a></b><br>The event when God's judgment will be executed swiftly and decisively against Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is inevitable and will come swiftly, as seen in the suddenness of Babylon's fall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_sorcery_and_human_wisdom.htm">The Futility of Sorcery and Human Wisdom</a></b><br>Reliance on sorcery and human wisdom is futile against the sovereign will of God.

The phrase sets the tone: God&#8217;s word moves faster than any human defense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In a single day</b><p>The timing is razor-sharp. God is not slow; His clock strikes exactly when He wills. &#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a> applies this to end-times Babylon: &#8220;her plagues will come in a single day.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a> foretells Assyria&#8217;s collapse in &#8220;one day,&#8221; revealing a biblical theme&#8212;when judgment comes, it is swift and undeniable. The warning invites humility: no nation or individual can schedule repentance after the deadline has already passed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Loss of children</b><p>For an empire, &#8220;children&#8221; points both to literal offspring and to future generations. The Medo-Persian conquest (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-18</a>) slaughtered Babylonian youth; the city&#8217;s legacy was cut off. &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/50-30.htm">Jeremiah 50:30</a> reports, &#8220;Her young men will fall in the streets.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a> shows that when God withdraws blessing, even large families dwindle. Sin never just affects the present; it erases tomorrow&#8217;s hopes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And widowhood</b><p>A widowed woman has no husband to protect or provide. Babylon, famed for alliances and armies, would suddenly stand alone. &#8226; <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a> pictures Jerusalem as a widow; now the pagan oppressor will taste the same sorrow. &#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a> records Babylon&#8217;s boast, &#8220;I sit as queen; I will never see widowhood,&#8221; yet the very thing she denies becomes her fate. God systematically dismantles every false security.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will come upon you in full measure</b><p>The discipline matches the offense&#8212;nothing partial, nothing withheld. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a> speaks of Jerusalem receiving &#8220;double for all her sins&#8221;; Babylon&#8217;s cup will likewise be filled to the brim (<a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>). Divine justice is precise: mercy is abundant for the repentant, but wrath is uncut for the defiant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In spite of your many sorceries and the potency of your spells</b><p>Babylon trusted in occult power, astrological charts, and ritual magic (<a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12-13</a>). None of it would cancel God&#8217;s decree. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a> condemns sorcery as detestable, a counterfeit refuge. &#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-27.htm">Daniel 2:27</a> shows Babylon&#8217;s magicians stumped by God&#8217;s revelation. &#8226; <a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a> portrays new believers burning their spell books&#8212;only the Lord delivers. Human enchantments crumble before the Sovereign Judge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a> promises Babylon two crushing blows&#8212;extinction of posterity and abandonment&#8212;arriving suddenly, completely, and irresistibly. The empire&#8217;s arcane arts cannot divert the Almighty&#8217;s hand. The verse therefore stands as a timeless warning: when people or nations trade trust in God for confidence in power, pleasure, or the occult, collapse is only a day away.

The day of the capture of the city by Cyrus, which was the third of Marchesvan, <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>. Then, "in a moment," Babylon lost the whole of her prestige, ceased to reign, ceased to be an independent power, became a "widow," had a portion of her population turn from her, was brought down to the dust. Loss of children, and widowhood came upon her in their perfection<span class="cmt_word">;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>in the full extent of their bitterness" (Cheyne). Not that Cyrus imitated her common practice by carrying off her entire population; on the contrary, she continued for more than two centuries to be a flourishing and populous town. Twice she revolted from Darius Hystaspis ('Beh. Ins.,' col. 1. par. 16; col 3, par. 13), once, perhaps, from Xerxes (Ctes., 'Ext. Pers,' &sect; 22). Alexander the Great found her walls and her great buildings in ruins, but still she was a considerable place. Cyrus, however, no doubt, carried off a portion of her population, which thenceforth begun to dwindle, and continually became less and less as time went on, until she sank into a solitude. That extreme desolation which the prophets paint in such vivid colours (<a href="/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>:19-22; 14:22, 23; <a href="/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>:15, 38-40; 2:36-43) was potentially contained in the capture by Cyrus, which was the work of a single day. <span class="cmt_word">For the multitude of thy sorceries... of thine enchantments</span> (comp. ver. 13; and see also <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>). The word here translated "sorceries" probably means "incantations" or "enchantments," while that translated "enchantments" means "spells." The addiction of the Babylonians to marc is largely attested by the classical writers, and has been proved beyond a doubt by the lately discovered native remains. By these it appears that their magic fell under three principal heads: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preparation and use of spells and talismans, which were written forms engraved on stone or impressed on clay, and worn on the person or attached to the object on which their influence was to be exerted; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the composition and recitation of formulae of incantation, which were supposed to act as charms, and to drive away demons and diseases; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the taking of observations and framing of tables of prognostics and of omens for general use, together with the casting of horoscopes for the special advantage of individuals (see Rawlinson's 'Egypt and Babylon,' p. 58; and comp.
