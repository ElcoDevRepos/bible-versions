In the context of Isaiah, this reflects the unity among the people in the face of adversity. Historically, the Israelites often faced external threats, and their survival depended on collective strength and encouragement. This idea of mutual support is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of the benefits of companionship and helping one another. The principle of helping one another is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>and says to his brother,</b><br>The use of "brother" signifies a close relationship, not necessarily by blood, but by shared identity and purpose. In ancient Israel, the term "brother" often extended to fellow Israelites, emphasizing solidarity and kinship. This reflects the covenant community's responsibility to support one another, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which commands love for one's neighbor. The concept of brotherhood is further expanded in the New Testament, where all believers are considered brothers and sisters in Christ (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Be strong!&#8221;</b><br>This exhortation to "be strong" is a common biblical encouragement, often given in times of fear or uncertainty. It is reminiscent of God's words to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>) as he prepared to lead Israel into the Promised Land. The call to strength is not merely physical but also spiritual, relying on God's presence and promises. In Isaiah's context, it reassures the people of God's support against their enemies. This encouragement is fulfilled in Christ, who strengthens believers (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>) and promises His presence with them always (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
