Historically, this event occurs after Hezekiah's miraculous recovery from illness and the defeat of the Assyrian army, which may have contributed to his sense of security and self-assurance. The envoys were sent by Merodach-Baladan, king of Babylon, likely to form an alliance against Assyria. This act of welcoming them gladly can be seen as a political maneuver, but it also reveals Hezekiah's failure to seek God's guidance in this matter, contrasting with his earlier reliance on God during the Assyrian threat.<p><b>and showed them what was in his treasure house&#8212;the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil</b><br>Hezekiah's display of his wealth to the Babylonian envoys signifies a moment of pride and a lack of discernment. The treasures mentioned&#8212;silver, gold, spices, and precious oil&#8212;were symbols of wealth and prosperity in the ancient Near East. This act of showing his treasures can be seen as a breach of wisdom, as it exposed the kingdom's wealth to potential adversaries. Biblically, this act foreshadows the future Babylonian captivity, as these treasures would eventually be taken to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>). Theologically, it serves as a warning against pride and the temptation to trust in material wealth rather than in God.<p><b>as well as his entire armory&#8212;all that was found in his storehouses</b><br>By revealing his armory, Hezekiah not only showed his wealth but also his military capabilities. This act could be interpreted as an attempt to impress or form a military alliance with Babylon. However, it also exposed Judah's defenses to a future enemy. The armory's inclusion highlights the comprehensive nature of Hezekiah's disclosure, leaving nothing hidden. This indiscretion is a stark contrast to the biblical principle of relying on God for protection rather than military might (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of Hezekiah's openness to the Babylonian envoys. It reflects a lack of discernment and foreshadows the consequences of such transparency. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and the dangers of pride. The complete exposure of his kingdom's wealth and resources can be seen as a failure to recognize the sovereignty of God over all things. This act ultimately leads to Isaiah's prophecy of the Babylonian exile, where all that Hezekiah showed would be taken away (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>). This serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of pride and the importance of seeking God's wisdom in all matters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God but also for his human weaknesses.

The display was obviously something more than the ostentation of a Cr?sus showing his treasures to Solon (Herod. i. 3). It was practically a display of the resources of the kingdom, intended to impress the Babylonian ambassadors with a sense of his importance as an ally.<p><span class= "bld">The spices, and the precious ointment . . .</span>--The mention of these articles as part of the king's treasures is characteristic of the commerce and civilisation of the time. "Spices"--probably myrrh, gumbenzoin, cinnamon--had from a very early period been among the gifts offered to princes (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-10.htm" title="And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.">1Kings 10:10</a>). The "ointment," or perfumed oil, finds its parallel in the costly unguent of the Gospel history (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>; <a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>). Esar-haddon's account of the magnificence of his palace (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iii.</span>, 122) supplies a contemporary instance of like ostentation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah was glad of them</span>. A more pregnant phrase than that which replaces it in 2 Kings, "hearkened unto them." Hezekiah, like Merodach-Baladan, was looking out for allies, and "was glad," thinking that in Babylon he had found one which might render him important service. Sargon's promptness, however, frustrated his hopes. In <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> that prince, regarding Merodach-Baladan's proceedings as constituting a real danger to his kingdom, made a great expedition into Babylonia, defeated Merodach-Baladan, and took him prisoner, after which he had himself crowned King of Babylon, and during the remainder of his life ( <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> to 705) ruled both countries. <span class="cmt_word">Showed them the house of his precious things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his treasury, or store-house. The treasuries of ancient monarchs were actual <span class="accented">store-chambers</span>, in which large quantities of the precious metals and valuable objects of various kinds were deposited (see Herod., 2:121; Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:16, 18, etc.). The flourishing state of the treasury is an indication that the events here narrated are anterior to the great surrender of treasure to Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; 'Epenym Canon,' p. 135). <span class="cmt_word">All the house of his armour</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). If a warlike alliance was contemplated, it was as important to show the possession of arms as of treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. We must allow for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is, that, without any reserve, Hezekiah showed all that he could show. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/39-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">welcomed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#347;&#183;ma&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
