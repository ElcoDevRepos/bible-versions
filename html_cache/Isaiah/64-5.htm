In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites are reminded of the covenant relationship with God, where obedience leads to blessings. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. The concept of doing right is deeply rooted in the Law given to Moses, which outlines the moral and ethical standards expected of God's people. The idea of God welcoming the righteous is also echoed in <a href="/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>, which describes the character of those who may dwell in God's sanctuary.<p><b>who remember Your ways</b><br>Remembering God's ways involves adhering to His commandments and living according to His statutes. This phrase suggests a conscious effort to align one's life with God's revealed will. In the historical context, the Israelites often struggled with idolatry and forgetting God's laws, leading to periods of judgment and exile. The call to remember is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are warned not to forget the Lord who brought them out of Egypt. This remembrance is not merely intellectual but involves active obedience and faithfulness.<p><b>Surely You were angry, for we sinned</b><br>This acknowledges God's righteous anger in response to sin. The historical backdrop includes the Babylonian exile, a direct consequence of Israel's persistent disobedience and idolatry. God's anger is not arbitrary but is a response to covenant unfaithfulness, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The prophets frequently warned of God's impending judgment due to sin, yet they also spoke of His mercy and willingness to forgive upon repentance, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>.<p><b>How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the human predicament of sin and the need for divine intervention. It points to the necessity of repentance and the inadequacy of human efforts to achieve salvation. Theologically, this foreshadows the New Testament revelation of salvation through Jesus Christ, who provides the ultimate solution to sin. <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23-24</a> speaks of all having sinned and being justified freely by God's grace through the redemption in Christ. This phrase underscores the need for a savior and the transformative power of God's grace to deliver from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as welcoming the righteous and being angered by sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of Isaiah's message, struggling with sin and seeking salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary locations where Isaiah's prophecies were directed, representing the spiritual state of the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_and_salvation.htm">Sin and Salvation</a></b><br>The thematic elements of the verse, highlighting the tension between human sinfulness and divine salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_welcome_to_the_righteous.htm">God's Welcome to the Righteous</a></b><br>God is pleased with those who do right and remember His ways.

That was the law of God's dealings with men. He met, in this sense, those who at once rejoiced in righteousness and practised it. But with Israel it was not so. Their sins had brought them under His anger, not under His favour.<p>In <span class= "bld">those is continuance . . .</span>--The clause is difficult, and has been variously interpreted--(1) "<span class= "ital">In these </span>(the ways of God) <span class= "ital">there is permanence </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">eternity</span>)<span class= "ital">, that we may be saved;" </span>and (2) "<span class= "ital">In these </span>(the ways of evil) <span class= "ital">have we been a long time, and shall we be saved?" </span>The latter seems preferable. So taken, the clause carries on the confession of the people's sinfulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/64.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou meetest him that rejoiceth</span>. God "meets" with gracious welcome and ready aid whoever rejoices in doing righteousness and serving him, whoever "remembers him in his ways." But this, alas: is not the present relationship between God and Israel. God is "angry" with them - they must, therefore, "have sinned;" and so they proceed to confess their sin. <span class="cmt_word">In those is continuance, and we shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be saved.</span> This is a very difficult passage. Mr. Cheyne regards it as hopelessly corrupt. Bishop Lowth and Ewald attempt emendations. Of those who accept the present text, some understand "in those" of God's ways, others of the "sins" implied in the confession, "We have sinned:" some make the last clause an affirmation, others a question. Delitzsch renders, "Already we have been long in this state (of sin), and shall we be saved?" Grotius and Starck, "If we had remained in them (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy ways) continually, we should have been saved." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/64-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You welcome</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#7713;a&#8216;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6293.htm">Strong's 6293: </a> </span><span class="str2">To impinge, by accident, violence, by importunity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those who gladly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7797.htm">Strong's 7797: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bright, cheerful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#347;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">right,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1462;&#1428;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;e&#183;&#7695;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6664.htm">Strong's 6664: </a> </span><span class="str2">The right, equity, prosperity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who remember</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(yiz&#183;k&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Your ways.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7695;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
