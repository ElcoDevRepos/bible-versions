In the ancient Near Eastern context, witnesses were crucial in legal settings, and here, Israel is called to testify to the world about God's unique nature and deeds. This role as witnesses is foundational to their identity and mission, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>, where Israel's laws and wisdom are meant to demonstrate God's greatness to other nations.<p><b>&#8220;and My servant whom I have chosen&#8221;</b><br>The term "servant" often refers to Israel collectively, but it can also point to a messianic figure, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The concept of being chosen underscores God's sovereign election, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>. This choice is not based on Israel's merit but on God's love and purpose, highlighting His grace.<p><b>&#8220;so that you may consider and believe Me and understand that I am He.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the purpose of Israel's witness: to lead them to a deeper faith and understanding of God's identity. The phrase "I am He" echoes God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," underscoring His eternal and self-existent nature. This understanding is crucial for Israel's faith, as it distinguishes God from the idols of surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;Before Me no god was formed,&#8221;</b><br>This statement asserts the uniqueness and supremacy of God, countering the polytheistic beliefs of Israel's neighbors. It reflects the monotheistic foundation of Israel's faith, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). The idea that no god was formed before Him emphasizes His eternal existence and the futility of idol worship, a recurring theme in Isaiah.<p><b>&#8220;and after Me none will come.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reinforces God's eternal nature and the finality of His sovereignty. It assures Israel of God's unchanging presence and power, providing comfort and hope amid their challenges. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, where God is described as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, affirming His eternal reign and the futility of any other claims to divinity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, chosen by God to testify to His power, faithfulness, and uniqueness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Israel collectively, or prophetically pointing to the Messiah, who fulfills God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gods.htm">Gods</a></b><br>Refers to the false gods or idols that people worship, which are contrasted with the one true God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_witnesses.htm">The Role of Witnesses</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be witnesses of God's truth and character in our lives, just as Israel was called to testify to God's uniqueness and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_uniqueness.htm">Understanding God's Uniqueness</a></b><br>Recognize and affirm the uniqueness of God in a world filled with competing ideologies and beliefs.

Their calling and election had not been cancelled, and they might yet fulfil it. They, in that restoration from exile which Isaiah had foretold, should be a living proof of the foresight granted to the prophets, and, therefore, of the foreknowledge of Him who alone could say, "I am He," to whom past, present, and future were as one; and He, the Eternal, proclaims Himself as being also the only Saviour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are my witnesses</span>, <span class="cmt_word">saith the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Ye, Israel, are the witnesses that I cite" - ye can prove the antiquity of the historical books of Scripture by the ordinary modes by which antiquity is proved, and also the exact dates of the prophetical sues. Ye can show what clear and unambiguous prophecies have been delivered centuries before the event, as the destruction of Jerusalem by a nation in whom none can fail to recognize the Romans (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>), prophesied by Moses; the demolition of the altar at Bethel by a king of the house of David, Josiah by name, prophesied by a man of God in the reign of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>); the long continuance of David's progeny upon the throne of Judah, prophesied by Nathan in David's time (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>); the fairly long continuance of the house of Jehu on the throne of Israel, prophesied to Jehu himself (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>); and the like. Israel has been at all times, and still is, one of the most important witnesses for God that exists in the world. Like the Church, Israel is the "witness and keeper" of a large portion of "Holy Writ." Her past history witnesses for God. Her continued existence and present condition constitute additional testimony. <span class="cmt_word">And my Servant whom I have chosen</span>. To explain this as meaning "and ye are also my servant, whom I have chosen" (Nagelsbach, Cheyne, Delitzsch), is to empty it of all its force. Manifestly, a further witness is adduced, "Ye are my witnesses; and so is my Servant," etc. The "Servant" intended can only be the one true Servant of <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>, since faithful Israel is already among the witnesses. The prophet rises above the consideration of the immediately present, or of the single trial-scene which he is setting before us, and has in mind the great controversy ever going on between those who are for God and those who are against him. He sees, on the side of God <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> faithful Israel: and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ, the "Faithful Witness" (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>), who "came into the world that he should bear witness of the truth" (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). These are the two witnesses by whom God's truth is maintained in a world of falsehood and delusion. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>. The subject is changed. "Ye" here points to "the nations," or mankind at large. I am he (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before me there was no God formed</span>. All other gods beside me are "formed" gods - invented, fashioned, made by men. None of them was ever made before me. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no saviour</span>. None but God can save men. Man cannot make atonement for his fellows; "for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever" (<a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, Prayer-book Version). The human "saviours" whom God raises up to deliver his people out of the hand of their enemies (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>, etc.), are "saviours" in quite a secondary and inferior sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/43-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are My witnesses,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7695;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
