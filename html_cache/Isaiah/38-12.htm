In the ancient Near East, shepherds were nomadic, moving their tents frequently to find pasture for their flocks. This imagery emphasizes the temporary and fragile state of human existence. The context here is King Hezekiah's illness and his reflection on the brevity of life. The tent metaphor is also used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>, where Paul speaks of our earthly bodies as tents, highlighting the temporary nature of our earthly existence compared to the eternal dwelling with God.<p><b>I have rolled up my life like a weaver;</b><br>The imagery of a weaver rolling up fabric signifies the completion of a task. In ancient times, weaving was a common occupation, and the process of rolling up the finished cloth was a natural conclusion to the work. This metaphor suggests that Hezekiah sees his life as a completed work, ready to be finished. The weaver's imagery is also found in <a href="/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6</a>, where Job laments the swiftness of his days, comparing them to a weaver's shuttle. This connection underscores the theme of life's brevity and the inevitability of death.<p><b>He cuts me off from the loom;</b><br>This phrase indicates an abrupt end to life, as if the weaver's work is suddenly cut from the loom before its intended completion. In the context of Hezekiah's illness, it reflects his fear of dying prematurely. The cutting off from the loom can be seen as a divine intervention, where God determines the length of one's life. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges that his times are in God's hands, reinforcing the belief in God's sovereignty over life and death.<p><b>from day until night You make an end of me.</b><br>This expression conveys the rapid passage of time, from morning to evening, symbolizing the swift approach of death. In the cultural context, a day was often seen as a complete cycle of life, from birth to death. Hezekiah's lament here is a plea for God's mercy, as he feels his life is being cut short. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of human mortality, as seen in <a href="/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, where life is compared to grass that flourishes in the morning and withers by evening. This serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of life and the urgency to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is the speaker in this passage.
