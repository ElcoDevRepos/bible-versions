The act of treading the winepress alone signifies a solitary and decisive action, emphasizing the speaker's unique role and authority. In biblical symbolism, the winepress often represents judgment (<a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>). The solitary nature of the action underscores the idea that this judgment is carried out by God alone, without assistance from any human or nation, highlighting divine sovereignty and the insufficiency of human intervention in divine matters.<p><b>and no one from the nations was with Me</b><br>This phrase indicates the absence of any allies or helpers from among the nations, suggesting a universal judgment where no nation is righteous enough to assist. It reflects the theme of God's holiness and the separation between divine justice and human sinfulness. The nations often symbolize worldly powers and systems opposed to God's will (<a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>). This separation also points to the exclusivity of God's redemptive work, which is fulfilled in Christ, who alone is capable of executing divine justice and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>).<p><b>I trampled them in My anger and trod them down in My fury</b><br>The imagery of trampling and treading down conveys a powerful and overwhelming act of judgment. Anger and fury are expressions of God's righteous indignation against sin and rebellion. This reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution, where God's holiness demands justice against unrighteousness (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>). The intensity of the language underscores the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine judgment. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over evil, as seen in prophetic visions of the end times (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p><b>their blood spattered My garments</b><br>The spattering of blood on garments is a vivid image of the consequences of judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, blood was a symbol of life and its loss represented death and destruction. This imagery is consistent with the sacrificial system, where blood was central to atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The staining of garments with blood signifies the thoroughness of judgment and the cost of sin. It also prefigures the sacrificial death of Christ, whose own blood was shed for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and all My clothes were stained</b><br>The complete staining of clothes indicates the totality and completeness of the judgment executed. In biblical terms, garments often symbolize one's deeds or righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>). The staining here suggests the pervasive impact of sin and the comprehensive nature of divine justice. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the sins of the world and whose own garments were metaphorically stained through His sacrificial death (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The passage ultimately points to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ, who alone can cleanse and restore.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker (Messiah/Divine Warrior)</a></b><br>The speaker is often interpreted as the Messiah or a divine warrior, representing God's judgment and salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_winepress.htm">The Winepress</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's judgment.

He crushes evil as grapes in a winepress, with no nation assisting Him, underscoring His unrivaled sovereignty. His anger and fury are holy responses to persistent rebellion, and the blood-spattered garments prove the judgment is both real and complete. For believers, the passage assures us of God&#8217;s ultimate victory and His readiness to deal with sin; for all, it issues an urgent call to seek the grace He now freely offers before He comes again to tread the winepress alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/63.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I have trodden the winepress alone . . .</span>--The "winepress" is here, as elsewhere (<a href="/joel/3-13.htm" title="Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm" title="The LORD has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the middle of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a wine press.">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18-20</a>), the received symbol of the carnage of battle.

In mine own might, with none to aid me. The literal wine-press was always trodden by a band of men. Of the people; rather, of <span class="accented">the peoples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the neighbouring nations none took part with God against the special enemies of his people, the Idumaeans. All more or less sympathized with his adversaries, and therefore participated in their punishment (see ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">For I will tread them... trample them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so I trode them</span> ... <span class="accented">trampled them</span> (Lowth, Rosenmuller, Delitzsch, Cheyne, by an alteration of the vowel-points). The whole is a prophecy of the future; but the dramatic form of the narrative requires that the verbs should be in the past. As "the peoples" would not help God, but took the side of his enemies, they too were placed in the winepress, and crushed under his feet. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">blood;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their juice.</span> Lowth and Kay translate, "life-blood;" Delitzsch, "life-sap;" Mr. Cheyne, excellently, "life-stream."
