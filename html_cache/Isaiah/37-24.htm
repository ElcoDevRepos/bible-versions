In the ancient Near East, kings often sent envoys to deliver messages, and these servants acted as extensions of the king's authority. The taunting of the Lord reflects a common theme in the Bible where human pride challenges divine authority, reminiscent of Goliath's defiance in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>. This act of blasphemy sets the stage for God's intervention, emphasizing His sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>and you have said: &#8220;With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains,</b><br>Chariots were a symbol of military power and technological advancement in ancient warfare. The Assyrian boast of ascending mountains with chariots underscores their confidence in their military might. Mountains often symbolize challenges or obstacles, and the claim of ascending them suggests overcoming significant barriers. This imagery contrasts with God's power, as seen in <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, where God's chariots are described as "tens of thousands and thousands of thousands," highlighting divine supremacy over human strength.<p><b>to the remote peaks of Lebanon.</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its majestic mountains and valuable cedar trees, often used in temple construction (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The reference to Lebanon's remote peaks signifies reaching the most inaccessible and prestigious areas, symbolizing ultimate conquest and dominance. This boastful claim reflects the Assyrian king's desire to demonstrate his reach and control over even the most distant and revered lands, challenging the notion of divine protection over these regions.<p><b>I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses.</b><br>Cedars of Lebanon were highly prized for their quality and durability, often associated with strength and majesty (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). Cutting down these trees symbolizes the destruction of what is considered valuable and strong. This act can be seen as an affront to God's creation, as these trees were used in the construction of sacred spaces, including Solomon's Temple. The imagery of cutting down cedars and cypresses also serves as a metaphor for the Assyrian king's intent to destroy and subjugate nations.<p><b>I have reached its farthest heights, the densest of its forests.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of Assyrian ambition and conquest, reaching the most distant and impenetrable areas. Forests in biblical literature often symbolize mystery and the unknown, and penetrating them signifies overcoming formidable challenges. The claim of reaching these areas reflects the Assyrian king's belief in his invincibility and the futility of resistance against his power. This boast is ultimately countered by God's promise of protection and deliverance for His people, as seen in the subsequent verses of <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who boasted against the Lord, claiming his military conquests as his own achievements.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, who sought the Lord's help against the Assyrian threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message to Hezekiah, assuring him of divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The powerful empire under Sennacherib, known for its military might and conquests.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its majestic cedar trees, symbolizing strength and pride, which Sennacherib claimed to have conquered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_folly_of_pride.htm">The Folly of Pride</a></b><br>Sennacherib's arrogance serves as a warning against pride.

The inscriptions of the Assyrian king are full of like boasts. Shalmaneser, "Trackless paths and difficult mountains <span class= "bld">. . .</span> I penetrated" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iii.</span> 85): and Assumacirpal, "Rugged mountains, difficult paths, which for the passage of chariots were not suited, I passed" (<span class= "ital">Ibid. </span>p. 43).<p><span class= "bld">To the sides of Lebanon.</span>--The passage of Lebanon was not necessarily implied in Sennacherib's invasion of Palestine. Possibly the words had become a kind of proverb for surmounting obstacles. Lebanon and Carmel are joined together, as in <a href="/isaiah/33-9.htm" title="The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.">Isaiah 33:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord</span> (see <a href="/isaiah/36-15.htm">Isaiah 36:15-20</a>). And hast said. Sennacherib had not actually uttered these words with his mouth; but the prophet clothes in his own highly poetic language the thoughts which the Assyrian king had cherished in his heart. He had regarded "the multitude of his chariots" as irresistible; he had considered that the mountains which guarded Palestine would be no obstacle to his advance; he had contemplated ravaging and despoiling of its timber the entire country; he had meant to penetrate into every region that was lovely and fertile. The emphatic "I" of the original <span class="accented">- ani -</span> twice repeated, marks the proud egotism of the monarch. <span class="cmt_word">By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the multitude</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots.</span> The Assyrian kings contrived to cross with their chariots mountain chains of great difficulty, and frequently boast of the achievement. Tiglath-Pileser I. says, "I assembled my chariots and warriors. I betook myself to carts of iron in order to overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness thus practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 9, 10). Asshur-izir-pal, "The rugged hill country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and armies, with instruments of iron I cut through, and with metal rollers I beat down the chariots and troops I brought over" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 58). Shalmaneser II., "Trackless paths, difficult mountains, which like the point of an iron sword stood pointed to the sky, on wheels of iron and bronze I penetrated. My chariots and armies I transported over them" (ibid., p. 85). In the less rough parts, while the warders dismounted, tire horses drew the chariots, which were assisted over obstacles by attendants ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74); but, in regions of greater difficulty, they were conveyed across the mountain ranges in waggons of rude and strong construction ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13) The chariot-force was regarded as so important that the Assyrians never made any distant expedition without it. <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon</span>. It was not necessary to cross either Libanus or Anti-Libanus in order to invade Judaea, <span class="accented">since</span> the natural route was along the Coele-Syrian valley and across the spurs of Hermon to the Jordan; but an Assyrian army was intent on plunder and devastation, no less than upon conquest, and would ascend mountain regions that did not lie on its direct line of march for either or both of these objects. It was customary for the soldiers to cut clown the tall cedars and choice fir trees of Lebanon on their Syrian campaigns, in order to transport the timber to Nineveh and other great cities, where it was used for building (see the comment on Isaiah 14:8, and compare Layard, 'Nineveh and <span class="accented">Babylon</span>,' pp. 356, 357, and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 47, 83, 90; vol. 5. p. 119; vol. 9. p. 16, etc.). It was also customary to destroy the trees in an enemy's country, simply in order to inflict injury upon the foe ('Ancient Monarchies.' vol. 2. p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">I will enter into the height of his border</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will enter into its uttermost height</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will penetrate through the entire mountain region of Palestine, called roughly "Lebanon," to the furthest height of any importance - that on which Jerusalem stood - and thus occupy the whole land. The parallel passage of 2 Kings has "lodging" for "height," in apparent allusion to the palace of Hezekiah. And the forest of his Carmel; or, <span class="accented">the forest of its pleasure-garden</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rich plantation tracts, covered with vines, olives, and fig trees, which formed the special glory of Judaea (see <a href="/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16, 17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ya&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
