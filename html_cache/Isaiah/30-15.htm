The title "Holy One of Israel" is frequently used in Isaiah, highlighting God's covenant relationship with Israel. It underscores His purity and the expectation of holiness from His people. This divine authority sets the stage for the message that follows, indicating that it is not merely a human opinion but a divine decree.<p><b>By repentance and rest you would be saved;</b><br>Repentance involves a turning away from sin and a return to God, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. Rest signifies trust and reliance on God rather than human efforts or alliances, such as those Israel sought with Egypt. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation is linked to faith and trust in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The idea of rest also connects to the Sabbath, a time of ceasing from labor to focus on God, symbolizing spiritual rest in Him.<p><b>your strength would lie in quiet confidence&#8212;</b><br>Quiet confidence suggests a deep trust in God's power and provision, rather than noisy or frantic efforts to secure one's own safety. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>, "Be still, and know that I am God." The strength of believers is often depicted as coming from a calm assurance in God's sovereignty and faithfulness, rather than from external circumstances or personal abilities.<p><b>but you were not willing.</b><br>This phrase highlights the stubbornness and rebellion of the people, a recurring issue in Israel's history. Despite God's clear offer of salvation and strength, the people chose their own path, often leading to judgment and exile. This unwillingness to trust in God is a theme that runs throughout the Bible, contrasting with the willing obedience seen in figures like Abraham and ultimately in Jesus Christ, who submitted to the Father's will even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God of Israel, emphasizing His authority and holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_one_of_israel.htm">The Holy One of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God that underscores His unique relationship with Israel and His moral purity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being addressed in this passage, often characterized by their struggle with faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, known for his prophecies concerning judgment and redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah's_rebellion.htm">Judah's Rebellion</a></b><br>The historical context involves Judah's reliance on alliances with foreign nations rather than trusting in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_as_a_path_to_salvation.htm">Repentance as a Path to Salvation</a></b><br>True repentance involves turning away from self-reliance and sin, and turning towards God.

The "returning" spoken of is an abandonment of the course hitherto pursued, which was reckless provocation of Assyria and trust in Egypt. The "rest" is staying upon God - renunciation of trust on any arm of flesh, and simple reliance on the Divine aid, as sure to be sufficient when the need came. <span class="cmt_word">In quietness and confidence shall be your strength</span>; rather, <span class="accented">should be</span>.
