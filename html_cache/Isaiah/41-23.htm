In biblical context, prophecy is a hallmark of divine authority, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>, where the ability to foretell future events is a test of a true prophet. The challenge underscores the impotence of idols, contrasting them with the omniscience of God, who declares the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><b>so that we may know that you are gods</b><br>Here, the demand for predictive power is linked to the recognition of divinity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, gods were often associated with control over fate and history. This phrase highlights the futility of idol worship, as these man-made objects cannot demonstrate any divine attributes. The true God, in contrast, reveals His nature through fulfilled prophecy, as seen in the messianic prophecies fulfilled in Jesus Christ (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>).<p><b>Yes, do something good or evil</b><br>This phrase further challenges the idols to perform any act, whether beneficial or harmful, to prove their power. The cultural context of the time involved various deities who were believed to influence events, yet the God of Israel alone is shown to have true power over creation and history. This echoes Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18-24.htm">1 Kings 18:24</a>, where the inability of Baal to act demonstrated his nonexistence.<p><b>that we may look on together in dismay</b><br>The expected result of the idols' failure to act is collective dismay, highlighting the absurdity of idol worship. This communal aspect emphasizes the public nature of God's vindication over false gods. Historically, Israel's repeated turn to idolatry led to national dismay and judgment, as seen in the Babylonian exile. The phrase also points to the ultimate dismay of those who reject God, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, where the unrepentant face divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Can the heathen point to any good or evil fortune which, as having been predicted by this or that deity, might reasonably be thought of as his work?
