The "glorious arm" signifies divine intervention and strength. In the context of the Exodus, it highlights God's active role in delivering Israel from Egypt. The arm of the Lord is a recurring theme in Isaiah (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>), symbolizing salvation and judgment.<p><b>to lead them by the right hand of Moses</b><br>Moses is depicted as God's chosen leader, guided by divine power. The "right hand" symbolizes authority and skill. Moses, as a type of Christ, prefigures Jesus as the ultimate deliverer and mediator. This leadership is not by Moses' own strength but through God's empowerment, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a> when Moses parts the Red Sea.<p><b>who divided the waters before them</b><br>This refers to the miraculous parting of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). It demonstrates God's control over creation and His ability to make a way where there seems to be none. This act is a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom, and is referenced in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a> as a foreshadowing of Christian baptism.<p><b>to gain for Himself everlasting renown</b><br>God's actions in history, such as the Exodus, are meant to reveal His glory and establish His reputation among the nations.
