The fool's speech is characterized by folly, which in the Hebrew context often implies a rejection of God's order and wisdom. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>his mind plots iniquity.</b><br>The fool's heart, or inner being, is set on devising evil. This reflects the biblical understanding that sin originates in the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The plotting of iniquity suggests intentional and premeditated sin, contrasting with the righteous who meditate on God's law (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>).<p><b>He practices ungodliness</b><br>Ungodliness here refers to actions that are contrary to God's nature and commands. This behavior is not just a passive state but an active practice, indicating a lifestyle of rebellion against God. The New Testament echoes this in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where ungodliness is linked to the suppression of truth.<p><b>and speaks falsely about the LORD;</b><br>False speech about God can include blasphemy, heresy, or misleading others about His nature and will. This is a serious offense in the biblical context, as it misrepresents the truth of God and can lead others astray (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The prophets often condemned false prophets who spoke lies in God's name (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>he leaves the hungry empty</b><br>This phrase highlights the social injustice perpetuated by the fool. In biblical times, caring for the poor and needy was a significant aspect of righteous living (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>). The fool's neglect of the hungry contrasts with God's command to provide for the less fortunate (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>).<p><b>and deprives the thirsty of drink.</b><br>Similar to leaving the hungry empty, depriving the thirsty of drink underscores a lack of compassion and justice. Water is a basic necessity, and in the arid climate of the ancient Near East, denying it to someone was a grave injustice. This act of deprivation is contrary to the biblical call to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and reflects a heart hardened against God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and the future of Israel.

A fool&#8217;s speech is self-centered, careless, and destructive, echoing <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>, &#8220;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes.&#8221; Jesus warns in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a> that &#8220;men will give account for every careless word,&#8221; underscoring that foolish talk is never harmless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mind plots iniquity</b><p>The tongue only reveals what the heart has been nurturing (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>). Isaiah highlights the deliberate nature of sin: &#8220;His mind plots iniquity.&#8221; This mirrors <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where &#8220;every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/6-18.htm">Proverbs 6:18</a> lists &#8220;a heart that devises wicked schemes&#8221; among the things the Lord hates.
