In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were often rebellious, yet God continually sought to restore them. This reflects God's unchanging nature, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where He is described as "compassionate and gracious." The longing indicates a deep, heartfelt desire, emphasizing God's patience and love. This grace is not earned but freely given, aligning with the New Testament teaching of salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>therefore He rises to show you compassion,</b><br>The imagery of God rising suggests an active, deliberate movement towards His people. This action signifies readiness and eagerness to intervene on behalf of His people. Compassion here is a profound, tender mercy, akin to a parent's love for a child. This is consistent with the portrayal of God in <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, where He is likened to a father who has compassion on his children. The rising also foreshadows the ultimate act of compassion in the New Testament, where God sends His Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem humanity.<p><b>for the LORD is a just God.</b><br>God's justice is a central theme throughout the Bible. It assures that He will act righteously and uphold His moral order. In the historical context, Israel often faced consequences for their disobedience, yet God's justice also meant He would restore them when they repented. This justice is perfectly balanced with His mercy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>, where righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. The justice of God is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who satisfies divine justice through His atoning sacrifice (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><b>Blessed are all who wait for Him.</b><br>Waiting for the Lord implies trust and hope in His timing and promises. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, encouraging believers to remain faithful and patient. In the cultural context, waiting was often associated with expectation and reliance on God's deliverance, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-26</a>. The blessing promised here is both spiritual and practical, as those who wait on the Lord experience His peace and provision. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to wait for the return of Christ (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is characterized by grace, compassion, and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Isaiah is prophesying, often depicted as rebellious and in need of repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, calling the people back to trust in the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing threats from surrounding nations and tempted to seek alliances rather than trust in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire at the time, posing a significant threat to Judah, leading to political and spiritual crises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_to_show_grace.htm">God's Desire to Show Grace</a></b><br>God longs to be gracious to His people, indicating His proactive love and mercy.

The denunciations of the preceding passage (vers. 9-17) had been so terrible that, without some counterpoise of promise, they must have produced a general despair. This was not the Divine purpose. Judah's probation still continued. Therefore it was necessary to let it be seen that the Divine long-suffering was not yet exhausted - there were still conditions under which God would be gracious to his people. The conditions were "crying to the Lord" (ver. 19), and entire abolition of idolatry (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>. "Because your sins require this chastisement" (Kay); "Because of the extremity of your need" (Cheyne). It is, perhaps, best to own that the motives of the Divine action are very commonly obscure; and, if seen clearly by the prophets, are certainly not clearly set forth, being (it may be) inscrutable. While the motive, however, is obscure, the promise is plain and unmistakable, <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</span> God is not about at present to "make a full end;" he is bent on "waiting" - his intent is "to be gracious." He will be exalted, that he may have mercy. He will find some means of vindicating his honor and exalting himself, short of your destruction, in order that it may be open to him to give you a further chance of repentance, whereby you would obtain mercy. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord is a God of judgment</span>. God is essentially just; <span class="accented">sin must</span> receive punishment; but the punishment may be short of destruction. Justice does not exclude mercy.
