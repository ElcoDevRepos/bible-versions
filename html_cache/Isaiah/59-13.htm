In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were often guilty of turning away from God's commandments, as seen throughout their history (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32:1-6</a> with the golden calf incident). Rebellion against God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating humanity's tendency to choose its own path over divine guidance. This rebellion is not just a passive neglect but an active denial of God's sovereignty, akin to the actions of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The denial of the LORD is a serious offense, as it breaks the covenant relationship established between God and His people.<p><b>turning away from our God</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate choice to abandon the relationship with God. Historically, Israel's turning away often involved idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which led to spiritual and moral decay (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>). The act of turning away is symbolic of a heart that is not aligned with God's will, reminiscent of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>, who left his father's house. This turning away is a betrayal of the intimate relationship God desires with His people, as seen in the covenant language of <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>.<p><b>speaking oppression and revolt</b><br>This phrase reflects the social injustices and political upheaval present in Isaiah's time. The leaders and people of Israel were guilty of exploiting the vulnerable, contrary to God's laws that emphasize justice and care for the oppressed (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>). Speaking oppression suggests a systemic issue where injustice is perpetuated through words and actions. Revolt indicates a broader societal rebellion against God's ordained order, similar to the rebellion of Korah in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. This behavior is condemned by the prophets, who call for repentance and a return to righteousness (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).<p><b>conceiving and uttering lies from the heart</b><br>This phrase underscores the deceitfulness and moral corruption that begins internally. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of thought and intention (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The conception of lies suggests premeditated sin, not just impulsive actions. This internal corruption is what Jesus addresses in <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>, where He explains that evil thoughts and actions originate from the heart. The utterance of lies is a direct violation of the ninth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>) and reflects a character contrary to the truth embodied by Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The emphasis on the heart indicates that true repentance and transformation must begin internally, aligning with the promise of a new heart in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
