The proclamation reflects God's sovereignty and His intention to reach every corner of the world. This echoes the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The phrase also highlights the prophetic nature of Isaiah's message, as God's declarations often involve future events and divine promises.<p><b>Say to Daughter Zion</b><br>"Daughter Zion" is a term of endearment for Jerusalem and, by extension, the people of Israel. It reflects God's intimate relationship with His chosen people. The use of "daughter" suggests care, protection, and a familial bond. This phrase is often used in prophetic literature to address the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which also speaks of a coming king. The term underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>See, your Savior comes!</b><br>This is a prophetic announcement of deliverance and salvation. The coming of the Savior is a central theme in messianic prophecies, pointing to the arrival of Jesus Christ. The anticipation of a Savior is rooted in the promises made to David and the expectation of a Messiah who would establish God's kingdom. This phrase connects to the New Testament fulfillment in passages like <a href="/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>, where Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is seen as the arrival of the Savior.<p><b>Look, His reward is with Him</b><br>The reward signifies the blessings and benefits that accompany the Savior's arrival. This can be understood as both spiritual and material blessings, reflecting the restoration and renewal promised to God's people. The concept of reward is also found in <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>, where Jesus declares that He is coming soon and His reward is with Him, to repay each person according to their deeds. This highlights the justice and faithfulness of God in rewarding His people.<p><b>and His recompense goes before Him</b><br>Recompense refers to the just and fair repayment for actions, both good and bad. This phrase suggests that the Savior's coming will bring about divine justice, rewarding the faithful and punishing the wicked. It emphasizes the righteousness of God's judgment and the fulfillment of His promises. The idea of recompense is consistent with biblical themes of justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>, which also speaks of God's reward and recompense. This assures believers of God's ultimate justice and the vindication of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is making a proclamation to the entire world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_zion.htm">Daughter Zion</a></b><br>A term used to refer to the people of Jerusalem or Israel, symbolizing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_savior.htm">The Savior</a></b><br>The anticipated Messiah, who is coming to deliver and redeem His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ends_of_the_earth.htm">Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>This phrase indicates the universal scope of God's message, emphasizing that it is meant for all nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reward_and_recompense.htm">Reward and Recompense</a></b><br>These terms refer to the blessings and justice that the Savior brings with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_universal_message.htm">God's Universal Message</a></b><br>The proclamation to the "ends of the earth" reminds us that God's message of salvation is for all people, not just a select few.
