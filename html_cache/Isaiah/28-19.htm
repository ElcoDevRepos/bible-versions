The imagery of something passing through and carrying away suggests a relentless and unstoppable force, often interpreted as the Assyrian invasion. Historically, the Assyrians were known for their military prowess and their ability to conquer and exile nations. This serves as a warning to the Israelites that their reliance on foreign alliances and their own strength will not save them from God's judgment.<p><b>it will sweep through morning after morning, by day and by night.</b><br>The continuous nature of the judgment is emphasized here, indicating that it will be persistent and inescapable. The mention of "morning after morning" and "by day and by night" suggests a comprehensive and unrelenting calamity. This can be seen as a reflection of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to ongoing suffering and distress. The imagery of sweeping through also evokes the idea of a flood, which is often used in the Bible to symbolize overwhelming judgment (e.g., the flood in Genesis).<p><b>The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.</b><br>The realization of the severity and certainty of God's judgment is meant to instill fear and prompt repentance. The message is clear: ignoring God's warnings and continuing in sin will lead to devastating consequences. This terror is not just fear of physical destruction but also a recognition of the spiritual implications of being separated from God's protection and favor. The prophetic message serves as a call to return to God and seek His mercy. This theme of fear leading to repentance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
