The title "LORD" (YHWH) is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and self-existent nature. "The Holy One of Israel" underscores God's unique relationship with Israel, highlighting His purity and separateness from sin. "Its Maker" refers to God as the Creator, not only of Israel but of all things, affirming His sovereignty and power. This introduction sets the stage for the divine message that follows, reminding the audience of God's ultimate authority and creative power.<p><b>Concerning things to come,</b><br>This phrase points to God's omniscience and His control over future events. It suggests that God has a divine plan and purpose that extends beyond the present circumstances. In the context of Isaiah, this often relates to prophecies about the coming Messiah and the ultimate redemption of Israel. It also reflects the biblical theme that God knows the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>) and that His plans will be fulfilled.<p><b>do you question Me about My sons,</b><br>Here, "My sons" likely refers to the people of Israel, whom God considers His children. The rhetorical question implies a challenge to those who doubt or question God's plans for His people. It reflects a common biblical theme where God is portrayed as a Father to Israel (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>, <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a rebuke to those who presume to understand or dictate God's purposes for His chosen people.<p><b>or instruct Me in the work of My hands?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and wisdom in creation and His ongoing work in the world. The "work of My hands" refers to all that God has made and is doing, including His plans for salvation and judgment. The rhetorical question highlights the futility and arrogance of attempting to instruct or correct God, who is all-knowing and all-powerful. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God questions Job about the mysteries of creation, underscoring human limitations in understanding divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_one_of_israel.htm">The Holy One of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God that underscores His holiness and unique relationship with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God to be His people, through whom He would reveal His character and purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus.htm">Cyrus (implied context)</a></b><br>Though not mentioned in this specific verse, Cyrus is the Persian king whom God anointed to deliver Israel from Babylonian captivity, as discussed in the surrounding chapters.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_work_of_god's_hands.htm">The Work of God's Hands</a></b><br>Refers to God's creation and His sovereign plans, including His work in history and in the lives of individuals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_authority.htm">God's Sovereignty and Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that God, as the Creator, has ultimate authority over all creation, including our lives and circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Trust that God's plans are perfect and beyond our understanding, even when they do not align with our expectations or desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Approach God with humility, acknowledging that His wisdom and knowledge far exceed our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_god's_will.htm">Submission to God's Will</a></b><br>Submit to God's will, understanding that His purposes are for our good and His glory, even when they challenge our understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>Cultivate a deep reverence for God's holiness, recognizing His unique and set-apart nature as the Holy One of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_45_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 45:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_45_11_on_God_s_role_in_choices.htm">How does Isaiah 45:11 emphasize God's sovereignty in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_ask_Me_teach_about_prayer.htm">What does "ask Me about the things to come" teach about prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_45_11_Genesis_1_1_link.htm">How does Isaiah 45:11 relate to God's authority in Genesis 1:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Use_Isaiah_45_11_s_power_in_life.htm">How can we apply God's creative power in Isaiah 45:11 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trust_s_role_in_God_s_plans_Isaiah_45_11.htm">What role does trust play in understanding God's plans in Isaiah 45:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_45_11_Questioning_God_s_authority.htm">How does Isaiah 45:11 challenge the concept of questioning God's plans and authority?

This sentence is wrongly punctuated. The last three words should be attached to what follows, thus: "Ask me of things to come: concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> first learn of me what in my designs is to be the course of human events, and then (if necessary) give me directions concerning my sons (Israel), who are the work of my hands; but do not presume to give me directions while you are still in utter ignorance of my designs. In any case remember who I am - the Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, One accustomed to give directions to the angelic host (ver. 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/45-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1447;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Holy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6918.htm">Strong's 6918: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sacred, God, an angel, a saint, a sanctuary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">One of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and its Maker:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
