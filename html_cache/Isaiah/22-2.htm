The "commotion" and "revelry" suggest a city caught up in chaos and celebration, possibly indicating a false sense of security or denial of impending judgment. Historically, Jerusalem was a center of activity and festivity, especially during religious festivals. The revelry could also imply moral and spiritual decay, as seen in other prophetic writings where cities are rebuked for their indulgence and neglect of God's commands (<a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>, <a href="/amos/6.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>).<p><b>Your slain did not die by the sword, nor were they killed in battle.</b><br>This indicates an unusual circumstance where the deaths in Jerusalem were not due to conventional warfare. It suggests a divine judgment or calamity that befell the city, possibly through siege, famine, or plague, rather than direct military confrontation. This aligns with the historical context of the Assyrian siege under Sennacherib, where God intervened, and many Assyrians died without a battle (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). Theologically, it underscores the idea that God&#8217;s judgment can manifest in various forms, not limited to human warfare, and serves as a warning to the people of Jerusalem to repent and turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_commotion.htm">City of Commotion</a></b><br>This refers to Jerusalem, which is depicted as a place of chaos and disorder.
