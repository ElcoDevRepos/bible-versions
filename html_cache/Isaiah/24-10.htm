In the context of Isaiah, this could refer to the judgment upon the nations, symbolizing the fall of a once-great city due to divine wrath. The term "chaos" evokes the idea of disorder and confusion, reminiscent of the state of the world before creation in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. This imagery is often used in prophetic literature to describe the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The shattering of the city can be seen as a fulfillment of divine prophecy, where God&#8217;s judgment is executed upon those who have turned away from His commandments. This can also be connected to the eschatological themes found in Revelation, where Babylon, representing worldly systems opposed to God, is ultimately destroyed.<p><b>every house is closed to entry.</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete cessation of normal life and community. In ancient times, a closed house would signify desolation and abandonment, as homes were typically open to family and guests. The closing of houses could symbolize the end of hospitality and social interaction, reflecting a society under judgment. This imagery might also suggest a quarantine-like state, where people are isolated due to fear or destruction. In a broader biblical context, this can be linked to the plagues of Egypt, where homes were marked and protected during the Passover, contrasting with the judgment outside. The closing of houses can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual barrenness, where the presence of God is absent, and the community is devoid of life and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_chaos.htm">The City of Chaos</a></b><br>This term refers to a symbolic city representing the world or a society in rebellion against God.
