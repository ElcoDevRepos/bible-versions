The commandments refer to the laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai, which were meant to guide Israel in righteousness and holiness. The historical context is the period of the Babylonian exile, a consequence of Israel's failure to adhere to God's laws. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience. The call to "pay attention" suggests a deep, attentive listening and adherence, which is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-22</a>.<p><b>your peace would have been like a river</b><br>The imagery of peace as a river suggests a continuous, flowing, and abundant state of well-being. In the ancient Near East, rivers were vital for life, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and trade. This metaphor indicates a life of prosperity and stability, which contrasts with the turmoil experienced by Israel due to their disobedience. The peace mentioned here is akin to the Hebrew concept of "shalom," encompassing wholeness and harmony. This peace is also a foreshadowing of the peace brought by the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the coming of the "Prince of Peace" is prophesied.<p><b>and your righteousness like waves of the sea</b><br>Righteousness here refers to living in accordance with God's standards. The comparison to waves of the sea suggests a vast, powerful, and unending righteousness. This imagery conveys the idea of righteousness being as constant and overwhelming as the sea's waves. In biblical symbolism, the sea often represents chaos and the unknown, yet here it is used to describe the positive, relentless nature of righteousness. This righteousness is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect righteousness and offers it to believers, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. The waves also imply a dynamic and active righteousness, not static or passive, aligning with the call to live out one's faith actively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The verse reminds us that disobedience always costs more than it promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your peace would have been like a river</b><p>&#8226; God describes peace (Hebrew shalom) as something that could have flowed steadily and endlessly, not a trickle or a seasonal stream.<p>&#8226; Rivers refresh, sustain, and carve life into the landscape. Likewise, obeying God&#8217;s word produces constant, life-giving peace (<a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture rebukes the shallow, momentary &#8220;peace&#8221; the world offers and points to the deep, abiding wholeness only God gives when His ways are embraced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And your righteousness like waves of the sea</b><p>&#8226; Waves roll in day and night, unceasing and powerful. God intended Israel&#8217;s right living to surge forward continually, influencing each generation.<p>&#8226; Righteousness is not self-generated but the visible outworking of walking with the Holy One (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, Christ&#8217;s righteousness is imputed to us, then expressed through us as we &#8220;excel still more&#8221; in pleasing God (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>). Consistent obedience would have made righteousness as abundant and unstoppable as the ocean&#8217;s tide.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a> is God&#8217;s loving regret over blessings forfeited through disobedience.
