The concept of God's will is central, indicating that the suffering was not accidental but part of a divine plan. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and purpose in redemption (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). The idea of being "crushed" and "caused to suffer" reflects the intense physical and spiritual agony experienced by Jesus, as seen in the Gospels during His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). Theologically, this points to the necessity of atonement for sin, where the Servant bears the punishment on behalf of others (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><b>and when His soul is made a guilt offering,</b><br>The term "guilt offering" refers to a specific type of sacrifice in the Levitical system (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-19</a>), which was meant to atone for unintentional sins and required restitution. This sacrificial language underscores the substitutionary nature of the Servant's suffering, fulfilling the requirements of the law and providing a means for reconciliation with God. The use of "soul" emphasizes the totality of the Servant's offering, encompassing both physical and spiritual dimensions. This prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross, where He becomes the perfect and final offering for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>He will see His offspring,</b><br>Despite the Servant's suffering and death, this phrase promises a future beyond the grave. "Offspring" can be understood metaphorically, referring to spiritual descendants or those who come to faith through the Servant's work (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>). This is fulfilled in the New Testament as believers are considered children of God and heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The resurrection of Jesus is implied here, as it is through His victory over death that He sees the fruit of His sacrifice.<p><b>He will prolong His days,</b><br>This phrase suggests the Servant's life will continue, indicating resurrection and eternal life. In the context of the Messiah, it points to Jesus' resurrection and His eternal reign (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). The idea of prolonged days contrasts with the earlier mention of suffering and death, highlighting the triumph of life over death. This assurance of life is a cornerstone of Christian hope, affirming that death is not the end for those in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><b>and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.</b><br>The "good pleasure of the LORD" refers to God's purposes and plans, which are accomplished through the Servant. This prosperity is not material but spiritual, involving the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The phrase "in His hand" signifies the authority and power given to the Servant to carry out God's will. This is seen in the Great Commission, where Jesus, after His resurrection, declares all authority in heaven and earth has been given to Him (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). The prosperity of God's plan is evident in the spread of the Gospel and the growth of the Church throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who orchestrates the events described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>Traditionally understood by conservative Christians as a prophecy about Jesus Christ, who fulfills this role through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/offspring.htm">Offspring</a></b><br>Symbolically refers to the spiritual descendants of the Suffering Servant, those who come to faith through His sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering.htm">Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A reference to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where offerings were made to atone for sin.

It involved, that is, the idea not of an atonement only, but of a satisfaction, according to the nature of the sin. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him</span> (see the comment on ver. 6, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). The sufferings of Christ, proceeding from the "determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), and being permitted by him; were in some sort his doing. It "pleased him," moreover, that they should be undergone, for he saw with satisfaction the Son's self-sacrifice, and he witnessed with joy man's redemption and deliverance effected thereby. He hath put him to grief; rather, <span class="accented">he dealt grievously -</span> a sort of <span class="accented">hend-adys.</span> "He bruised him with a grievous bruising." <span class="cmt_word">When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin</span>. It is proposed (Ewald, Cheyne), by the alteration of a letter, to make the passage run thus: "When <span class="accented">he</span> shall make his soul an offering," etc., and argued that "he who offers the Servant's life as a sacrifice must be the Servant himself, <span class="accented">and not</span> Jehovah" (Cheyne). No doubt the Servant did offer his own life (see <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>," He gave his soul a ransom for many"); but that fact does not preclude the possibility of the Father having also offered it. "Believest thou not," said our Lord to Philip, "that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works" (<a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>). This <span class="accented">perienchoresis</span>, as the ancient theologians called it, makes it possible to predicate of the Father almost all the actions which can be predicated of the Son - all, in fact, excepting those which belong to the Son's humanity, or which involve obedience and subordination. As the Father had "laid on Christ the iniquity of us all" (ver. 6), as he had "bruised him and put him to grief," so he might be said to have "made his soul an offering for sin." All was settled in the Divine counsels from all eternity, and when the ideal became the actual, God the Father wrought with God the Son to effectuate it. "Offerings for sin," or "guilt offerings," were distinct from "sin offerings." The object of the former was "satisfaction," of the latter "expiation." The Servant of Jehovah was, however, to be both. "As in ver. 5 the Divine Servant is represented as a Sin Offering, his death being an expiation, so here he is described as a Guilt Offering, his death being a satisfaction" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 151). <span class="cmt_word">He shall see his</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed</span>. The "seed" of a teacher of religion are his disciples. St. Paul speaks of Onesimus as one whom he had "begotten in his bends" (<a href="/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>). He calls himself by implication the "father" of his Corinthian converts (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Both he and St. John address their disciples as "little children" (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18, 25</a> I:3:7, 18 I:4:4 I:5:21). It had long previously been promised that "a seed should serve" Messiah (<a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). Our Lord himself occasionally called his disciples his "children" (<a href="/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; <a href="/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>). He has always "seen his seed" in his true followers. <span class="cmt_word">He shall prolong his days.</span> A seeming contradiction to the statement (ver. 8) that he should be "cut off" out of the land of the living; and the more surprising because his death is made the condition of this long life: "When thou shalt make his soul an offering [or, 'sacrifice'] for sin," then "he shall prolong his days." But the resurrection of Christ, and his entrance upon an immortal life (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), after offering himself as a Sacrifice upon the cross, exactly meets the difficulty and solves the riddle (comp. <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pleasure of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> "In his hand" means "by his instrumentality." The "pleasure of the Lord" is God's ultimate aim and end with respect to his universe. This would "prosper" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be advanced, wrought out, rendered effectual - by the instrumentality of Christ. "Taking the verse as a whole, it sets forth <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the origin, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the nature, and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the result of the Saviour's sufferings.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/53-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet it was the LORD&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
