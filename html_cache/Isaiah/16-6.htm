Moab's reputation for arrogance is well-documented in the Bible. This phrase suggests that Moab's pride was well-known among neighboring nations. Historically, Moab was a prosperous region, which may have contributed to its sense of superiority. The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, which adds a familial tension to their interactions with Israel.<p><b>his exceeding pride and conceit</b><br>The repetition of terms related to pride emphasizes the depth of Moab's arrogance. In biblical terms, pride is often seen as a precursor to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction." Moab's pride is not just a personal failing but a national characteristic that sets them against God's people. This pride can be compared to the pride of other nations like Babylon, which also faced judgment due to their arrogance.<p><b>his overflowing arrogance</b><br>The imagery of "overflowing" suggests that Moab's arrogance was not contained but affected their actions and relationships with others. This can be seen in their interactions with Israel, where they often acted with hostility and disdain. The Bible frequently warns against arrogance, as it leads to a false sense of security and ultimately, judgment. This phrase highlights the extent to which Moab's pride had permeated their national identity.<p><b>But his boasting is empty</b><br>This statement serves as a prophetic declaration of Moab's impending judgment. Despite their pride and self-assuredness, their boasts are without substance. This echoes the biblical theme that human pride is ultimately futile in the face of God's sovereignty. The emptiness of Moab's boasting can be seen as a warning to all nations and individuals who rely on their own strength rather than acknowledging God's authority. This aligns with the message in <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>, where true boasting should be in understanding and knowing the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Cross-scripture sees the same pattern&#8212;self-exalting hearts invite downfall, while humility invites grace.
