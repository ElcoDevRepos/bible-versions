His rise is seen as an act of divine righteousness, fulfilling God's purposes for Israel. Historically, Cyrus is known for his just rule and policies of religious tolerance, aligning with the biblical portrayal of him as a righteous instrument of God. This prophecy underscores God's control over nations and leaders, using them to accomplish His divine plans.<p><b>and I will make all his ways straight</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention in Cyrus's conquests and governance, ensuring success and smooth paths. Biblically, "making ways straight" often symbolizes removing obstacles and providing guidance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. God's providence in Cyrus's victories, such as the fall of Babylon, demonstrates His power to direct history according to His will.<p><b>He will rebuild My city</b><br>Cyrus's decree to rebuild Jerusalem, recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, fulfills this prophecy. The rebuilding of Jerusalem is significant for the Jewish people, marking the end of the Babylonian exile and the restoration of their homeland. This act also prefigures the ultimate restoration and renewal found in Christ, who rebuilds the spiritual city of God, the Church.<p><b>and set My exiles free</b><br>Cyrus's edict allowed the Jewish exiles to return to their land, a pivotal moment in Jewish history. This liberation is a type of the greater deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from the bondage of sin. The return from exile is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing redemption and restoration.<p><b>but not for payment or reward</b><br>Cyrus's actions were not motivated by financial gain or personal reward, reflecting the selfless nature of God's deliverance. This aspect of the prophecy highlights God's grace, as the liberation of His people is an act of divine mercy rather than human merit. It parallels the salvation offered through Christ, which is given freely and not earned by works.<p><b>says the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority over all heavenly and earthly armies. It reassures the faithful of His power to fulfill His promises. This declaration affirms that the prophecy is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree, underscoring the certainty and reliability of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus.htm">Cyrus</a></b><br>The Persian king whom God anointed to deliver the Israelites from Babylonian captivity.
