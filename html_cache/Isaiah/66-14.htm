The context of <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66</a> is the promise of restoration and the coming glory of Jerusalem. The joy mentioned here is often associated with the fulfillment of God's promises and the manifestation of His salvation. In biblical history, moments of divine intervention, such as the return from Babylonian exile, were times of great rejoicing. This phrase also echoes the joy of the righteous at the second coming of Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, where the marriage of the Lamb brings rejoicing.<p><b>and you will flourish like grass</b><br>Flourishing like grass suggests rapid growth and renewal, symbolizing prosperity and blessing. In the arid climate of the Middle East, grass flourishes quickly after rain, representing the sudden and abundant blessings from God. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to describe the prosperity of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>). It also contrasts with the fate of the wicked, who are often compared to grass that withers (<a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>). The flourishing here can be seen as both physical and spiritual, indicating a time of peace and divine favor.<p><b>then the hand of the LORD will be revealed to His servants</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" signifies His power and intervention. In biblical terms, God's hand is often associated with deliverance and protection for His people (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). This revelation to His servants indicates a special manifestation of God's presence and action on behalf of those who are faithful to Him. It is a promise of divine support and vindication, aligning with the theme of God defending and blessing His chosen ones, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<p><b>but His wrath will be shown to His enemies</b><br>This phrase highlights the dual nature of God's intervention&#8212;salvation for His people and judgment for His adversaries. The wrath of God is a consistent theme in Scripture, representing His righteous anger against sin and injustice (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). In the context of Isaiah, this wrath is directed towards those who oppose God's purposes and oppress His people. The ultimate expression of this wrath is seen in eschatological prophecies, where God's final judgment is executed upon the wicked (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). This serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing the seriousness of being aligned against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reveals His power and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_the_lord.htm">Servants of the LORD</a></b><br>Those who are faithful and obedient to God, experiencing His blessing and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foes_of_the_lord.htm">Foes of the LORD</a></b><br>Those who oppose God, experiencing His judgment and wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem/zion.htm">Jerusalem/Zion</a></b><br>The city representing God's people and His dwelling place, often a focal point of prophetic fulfillment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, addressing both immediate and future contexts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_promises.htm">Joy in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers can find joy and hope in the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in the rejoicing of hearts in <a href="/isaiah/66-14.htm">Isaiah 66:14</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/flourishing_in_faithfulness.htm">Flourishing in Faithfulness</a></b><br>Just as grass flourishes, those who remain faithful to God will experience spiritual growth and vitality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_justice.htm">Understanding God's Justice</a></b><br>Recognize the dual nature of God's hand&#8212;blessing for His servants and judgment for His foes.
