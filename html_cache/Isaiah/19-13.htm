It was a significant political and religious center, often associated with wisdom and counsel. The reference to the princes of Zoan becoming fools indicates a failure of leadership and wisdom. This aligns with the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God, and without it, even the most esteemed leaders can fall into folly. The foolishness of these princes can be seen as a judgment from God, reflecting the broader theme of divine retribution against those who oppose His will.<p><b>the princes of Memphis are deceived.</b><br>Memphis, another major city in ancient Egypt, was a center of power and culture. The deception of its princes suggests a lack of discernment and understanding, leading to poor decision-making. This deception can be seen as a result of their reliance on false gods and human wisdom rather than seeking guidance from the true God. The theme of deception is prevalent in Scripture, often highlighting the consequences of turning away from God&#8217;s truth. This phrase underscores the idea that without divine insight, even the most powerful leaders can be easily misled.<p><b>The cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.</b><br>The term "cornerstones" refers to the foundational leaders or key figures within the tribes of Egypt. These individuals, who were supposed to provide stability and guidance, have instead led the nation into error. This imagery of cornerstones is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing strength and support. The failure of these leaders reflects a broader spiritual and moral decline within the nation. This phrase can be connected to the prophetic theme of judgment against nations that turn away from God. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of righteous leadership, as seen in the ultimate cornerstone, Jesus Christ, who provides true guidance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes_of_zoan.htm">Princes of Zoan</a></b><br>Zoan, also known as Tanis, was an ancient city in Egypt.

Like the nations in <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;2</a> who &#8220;plot in vain,&#8221; the princes reject the true God and are handed over to empty reasoning (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah has just said, &#8220;The spirit of Egypt will be emptied out in its midst&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>).

There are no grounds for changing "Noph" into "Moph." "Noph" is probably "Napata," known as "Nap" in the hieroglyphic inscriptions - the original capital of the Ethiopian kings, and, when Memphis had become their capital, still probably regarded as the second city of the empire.
