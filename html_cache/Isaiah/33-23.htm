In the context of ancient seafaring, slack ropes would indicate a ship that is not ready to sail, symbolizing a lack of readiness or strength. Biblically, this can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual laxity or the failure of human efforts without divine intervention. The imagery of slack ropes may also reflect Israel's reliance on their own strength rather than trusting in God.<p><b>they cannot secure the mast or spread the sail.</b><br>The inability to secure the mast or spread the sail further emphasizes the theme of inadequacy and helplessness. In a historical context, a ship unable to set sail would be vulnerable to the elements and unable to navigate effectively. This can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's inability to save themselves from impending judgment or disaster without God's help. It highlights the futility of human efforts apart from divine guidance and strength.<p><b>Then an abundance of spoils will be divided,</b><br>Despite the initial imagery of weakness, this phrase introduces a sudden reversal of fortune. The division of spoils suggests victory and abundance, often associated with the aftermath of a battle. In biblical history, spoils were typically divided among the victors, indicating a complete turnaround from a position of weakness to one of triumph. This can be seen as a prophetic promise of God's deliverance and provision for His people, even when they seem most vulnerable.<p><b>and even the lame will carry off plunder.</b><br>This phrase underscores the miraculous nature of the victory. The lame, typically unable to participate in battle or carry heavy loads, are depicted as taking part in the division of spoils. This imagery highlights God's power to enable and empower the weak, turning societal norms upside down. It echoes themes found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, where God chooses the weak things of the world to shame the strong. It also points to the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, where all, regardless of their physical or social status, share in His blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, often representing the people of Israel, who are under threat but will ultimately be delivered.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrians.htm">Assyrians</a></b><br>The oppressors and enemies of Israel during Isaiah's time, symbolizing the forces against God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lame.htm">The Lame</a></b><br>Represents those who are weak or disadvantaged, yet they will share in the victory and spoils.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/spoils.htm">Spoils</a></b><br>The wealth and goods taken from the defeated enemy, symbolizing God's provision and victory for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mast_and_sail.htm">The Mast and Sail</a></b><br>Metaphors for strength and readiness, indicating the current weakness and vulnerability of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance_in_weakness.htm">God's Deliverance in Weakness</a></b><br>Despite the apparent weakness ("Your ropes are slack"), God promises victory.

When ropes slacken at sea, there is no steering, no stability, no hope of progress. Here the Lord exposes the futility of human strength that dares to threaten His people:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter Judah&#8217;s foes are warned, &#8220;Woe to you, O destroyer&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>). The slack ropes prove that warning true.<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s image echoes God&#8217;s word to Judah in <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>&#8212;quiet trust in Him, not military alliances, brings salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They cannot secure the mast or spread the sail</b><p>Without tight rigging the mast sways and the sail collapses; the vessel becomes a helpless hulk. God is announcing that the invasion force, so terrifying to Judah, will suddenly be rendered useless:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25-27</a> describes sailors struck by a divine storm who &#8220;reeled and staggered like drunken men, and all their skill was useless&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a> shows the same principle on land: the Egyptians&#8217; chariot wheels came off at the Red Sea.<p>&#8226; This powerlessness magnifies the Lord who, just two verses earlier, promised to be &#8220;a place of broad rivers and streams&#8221; for His people (<a href="/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>). The enemy cannot sail on those waters because He controls them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then an abundance of spoils will be divided</b><p>The scene shifts from panic to plunder. Once the opponent is immobilized, God&#8217;s people move from fear to overflowing provision:<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a> Jehoshaphat&#8217;s army gathers &#8220;an abundance of goods&#8221; after the Lord defeats Moab and Ammon.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a> foretells similar joy: &#8220;You have increased the nation&#8217;s joy&#8230; they rejoice before You as men rejoice in the harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The turnaround underscores a familiar pattern&#8212;God&#8217;s deliverance not only protects but enriches those who trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even the lame will carry off plunder</b><p>No one is left out of the victory celebration, not even those least able to fight:<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6-7</a> promises, &#8220;I will assemble the lame&#8230; I will make the lame a remnant&#8221;.<p>&#8226; When David recovered the Amalekite spoil, he made certain that those too exhausted to pursue still shared equally (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture in Isaiah is ultimate security&#8212;the weakest believer walks into the enemy camp unopposed, arms full, because God Himself has fought.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a> shows the Lord dismantling an arrogant foe, leaving its &#8220;ropes&#8230; slack&#8221; and its mast and sail useless. The result is a complete reversal: abundant spoil for God&#8217;s people and participation even for the weakest among them.

The comparing of God to a river has led to the representation of Judah's enemies as warships (ver. 21).

The prophet's thoughts have traveled back to the existing state of things. <span class="cmt_word">They could not well strengthen their mast</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they cannot hold firm the lower part of their mast</span>. The mast had its lower extremity inserted into a hole in a cross-beam, and required to be kept in place by the ropes. If they were loose, it might slip out of the hole and fall overboard. <span class="cmt_word">They could not spread the sail</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they cannot spread the ensign</span>. The ensign would seem to have been attached to the top of the mast.
