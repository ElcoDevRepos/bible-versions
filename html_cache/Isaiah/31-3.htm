In the historical context, Egypt was a powerful nation, often seen as a source of military aid. However, the Israelites are reminded that the Egyptians, despite their might, are mere mortals. This echoes the biblical theme of reliance on God rather than human strength, as seen in <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>, which advises trust in the Lord over trust in princes.<p><b>their horses are flesh, not spirit.</b><br>Horses in ancient times were symbols of military strength and power. The reference to "flesh, not spirit" contrasts the physical, temporary nature of human resources with the eternal, spiritual power of God. This distinction is crucial in understanding the futility of relying on earthly power, as highlighted in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, which states that success comes "not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," says the Lord.<p><b>When the LORD stretches out His hand,</b><br>The imagery of God stretching out His hand signifies divine intervention and judgment. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to describe God's active role in delivering or disciplining His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a> during the plagues of Egypt. It underscores God's sovereignty and ability to influence the course of human events.<p><b>the helper will stumble,</b><br>The "helper" refers to Egypt, which Israel sought for assistance. The prophecy indicates that those who rely on human aid instead of God will find their support unreliable. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where reliance on foreign alliances often leads to downfall, as illustrated in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a> with King Asa's reliance on the king of Aram.<p><b>and the one he helps will fall;</b><br>This phrase indicates that not only will the helper (Egypt) fail, but also those who depend on them (Israel). It serves as a warning against misplaced trust and highlights the consequences of not seeking God's guidance. This is consistent with the biblical principle found in <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>, which warns against trusting in man and turning away from the Lord.<p><b>both will perish together.</b><br>The ultimate outcome of relying on human strength instead of God is destruction for both parties involved. This reflects the biblical teaching that true security and salvation come only from God. The fate of both the helper and the helped serves as a cautionary tale, reinforcing the message found in <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>, where reliance on Egypt is described as a source of shame and disgrace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>A powerful nation known for its military strength and reliance on horses and chariots.
