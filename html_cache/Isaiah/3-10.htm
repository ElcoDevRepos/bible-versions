The term "righteous" refers to those who live in accordance with God's laws and maintain a covenant relationship with Him. In the context of Isaiah, the righteous are contrasted with the wicked, who face judgment and destruction. This promise of well-being echoes the blessings outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for those who obey God's commandments. It also aligns with the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, which states that the righteous will receive a sure reward. The assurance of well-being for the righteous can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies perfect righteousness and offers eternal life to those who follow Him.<p><b>for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the principle of divine justice and reward. The "fruit of their labor" suggests that the righteous will experience the tangible benefits of their faithfulness and hard work. This concept is rooted in the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where the harvest was a direct result of one's labor and God's blessing. The idea of reaping what one sows is a recurring biblical theme, found in passages like <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, which encourages believers to not grow weary in doing good, for in due season they will reap a harvest. This promise also reflects the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, where the deeds of the righteous follow them into eternity. The assurance of enjoying the fruits of their labor serves as a motivation for the righteous to persevere in their faith and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and salvation of Israel.

&#8220;The righteous&#8221; are those who, like Noah in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a> and the blessed man of <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1&#8211;3</a>, trust God and align their conduct with His word.<p>&#8226;

The mention of the fact that the men of Jerusalem have permanently injured their moral natures by sin, and thus "rewarded evil to themselves," leads the prophet to declare at this point, parenthetically, the general law, which extends alike to the evil and the good - that men receive in themselves the recompense of their deeds. The righteous raise their moral nature, become better, and, in becoming better, become happier. "It is well with them, for of the fruit of their doings they eat." The wicked deprave and corrupt themselves, lower their moral nature, become worse than they were, and, in becoming worse, become more miserable. "Woe unto them! with them it is ill; for the achievement of their hands is given them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the righteous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it will be well</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for they will enjoy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fruit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6529.htm">Strong's 6529: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fruit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of their labor.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;al&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4611.htm">Strong's 4611: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deed, practice</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 3:10 Tell the righteous Good!
