Kings were often laid to rest with great pomp, reflecting their status and power. This practice is seen in various cultures, such as the Egyptians with their pyramids and the Mesopotamians with their ziggurats. The phrase underscores the universal nature of death, even for the most powerful, and serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of earthly power. In biblical context, it contrasts with the fate of the king of Babylon, who is denied such honor due to his pride and tyranny.<p><b>each in his own tomb</b><br>The mention of "his own tomb" signifies the personal and familial legacy that kings sought to establish. Tombs were often constructed to reflect the king's achievements and to ensure their memory endured. This practice is evident in the burial sites of the kings of Judah, such as the City of David in Jerusalem. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the resurrection, where each person will be raised individually. It also contrasts with the prophecy against the king of Babylon, who is denied a proper burial, symbolizing divine judgment and disgrace. This serves as a warning against pride and self-exaltation, themes prevalent throughout the book of Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_nations.htm">Kings of the Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the rulers of various nations who have passed away and are buried with honor in their own tombs.

Kings who once commanded armies and shaped history now appear together in a single scene of death.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly reminds us that no throne is permanent. <a href="/psalms/82-7.htm">Psalm 82:7</a> warns, &#8220;You will die like men; you will fall like every prince&#8221;. <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a> echoes that it is God who &#8220;removes kings and establishes them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Historically, these rulers enjoyed elaborate send-offs. Hezekiah was honored in &#8220;the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>). Even pagan kings like Pharaohs had grand pyramids (compare <a href="/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22&#8211;23</a>). Isaiah purposefully groups them all together to highlight their shared humanity&#8212;and the limits of their power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lie in state</b><p>&#8226; The phrase paints a formal, dignified setting. Bodies were displayed for public mourning, surrounded by treasures and memorial words. Yet, in death, that pomp offers no real advantage. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> observes, &#8220;No man has authority over the day of his death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Contrast comes in this very chapter: the king of Babylon will not receive such honor (<a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>). While other monarchs lie in state, he will be deprived of even the basic rites.<p>&#8226; The lesson surfaces: earthly acclaim cannot secure final respect. Jesus taught the rich man who &#8220;dressed in purple and fine linen&#8221; ended up in torment, while the overlooked beggar found comfort (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each in his own tomb</b><p>&#8226; Individual tombs symbolized prestige&#8212;sepulchers cut from rock, gardens reserved for royalty (<a href="/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a>; <a href="/john/19-41.htm">John 19:41</a>). Kings wanted their names and dynasties forever attached to magnificent burial chambers.<p>&#8226; Isaiah underscores that even in death they remain separated&#8212;each ruler clings to his own monument. Yet those tombs ultimately testify to mortality, not greatness. As <a href="/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a> states, &#8220;The slave is free from his master,&#8221; erasing status distinctions.<p>&#8226; The impending humiliation of Babylon&#8217;s king (<a href="/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>) contrasts sharply: he will be &#8220;cast out of his grave like a rejected branch.&#8221; God alone grants or withholds honor after death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18</a> pictures every worldly leader receiving customary burial honors&#8212;lying in state, resting in splendid tombs. The verse prepares us to see the shocking reversal awaiting the arrogant ruler of Babylon, who will be denied even these basic dignities. Kings may differ in life, but death places them on equal footing before the Lord who &#8220;brings low and lifts up&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a>).

The care taken to prepare tombs was not confined to Egypt, though there obtaining its greatest development.
