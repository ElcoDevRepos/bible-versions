In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord coming upon someone often signified God's selection and equipping for a specific task (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This is a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>, reads this passage in the synagogue and declares its fulfillment in Himself. The presence of the Spirit signifies the beginning of a new era of God's work among His people.<p><b>because the LORD has anointed Me</b><br>Anointing in the biblical context often refers to the consecration of someone for a holy purpose, such as kings, priests, and prophets (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>). This anointing is a divine appointment, indicating that the individual is set apart for God's mission. In the New Testament, Jesus is recognized as the Anointed One, the Messiah (Christos in Greek), fulfilling the roles of prophet, priest, and king.<p><b>to preach good news to the poor</b><br>The "good news" or gospel is central to the mission of Jesus. The poor, in this context, can refer to those who are economically disadvantaged, but also to those who are spiritually impoverished and in need of God's grace. This aligns with Jesus' ministry, where He often reached out to the marginalized and oppressed (e.g., <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, <a href="/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a>). The proclamation of good news is a key aspect of the Kingdom of God.<p><b>He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted</b><br>This phrase speaks to the compassionate nature of the Messiah's mission. The brokenhearted are those who are suffering from grief, loss, or despair. The imagery of binding up suggests healing and restoration. This reflects God's concern for the emotional and spiritual well-being of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>. Jesus' ministry was marked by acts of healing and comfort.<p><b>to proclaim liberty to the captives</b><br>Liberty to the captives can be understood both literally and metaphorically. In the historical context, it may refer to the release of those in physical bondage or exile. Spiritually, it signifies freedom from sin and its consequences. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus offers deliverance from spiritual captivity (e.g., <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, <a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<p><b>and freedom to the prisoners</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this speaks to liberation. The prisoners may represent those bound by sin, guilt, or spiritual oppression. The promise of freedom is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's desire to release His people from all forms of bondage (e.g., <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Jesus' death and resurrection are the ultimate fulfillment of this promise, offering eternal freedom to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord_god.htm">The Spirit of the Lord GOD</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, indicating divine empowerment and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His authority and relationship with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as the Messiah, who is empowered by God to fulfill His mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Those who are materially or spiritually impoverished, in need of God's intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brokenhearted,_captives,_and_prisoners.htm">The Brokenhearted, Captives, and Prisoners</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who are suffering, oppressed, or in bondage, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_by_the_holy_spirit.htm">Empowerment by the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Recognize that true ministry and service are empowered by the Holy Spirit.

The opening words repeat what had been said by Jehovah of the Servant in <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>. The "anointing," as it stands, might be that of king (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm" title="To morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.">1Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>), or priest (<a href="/exodus/29-2.htm" title="And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.">Exodus 29:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-36.htm" title="Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.">Leviticus 7:36</a>), or prophet (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>). As interpreted by its fulfilment, it may be held to include all three. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - THE MISSION OF THE SERVANT OF THE LORD. The words of our Lord in <a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears," preclude the application of this passage to any other than the Lord himself. It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of "the Servant" (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), he should proceed to take his place, and to "ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One" (Delitzsch). Hence most recent commentators, whatever their school of thought, have acquiesced in the patristic interpretation, which regarded the Servant of Jehovah as here speaking of himself. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">is upon me.</span> The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and one manuscript omit <span class="accented">adonai.</span> In the original announcement of "the Servant" it was stated that God had "put his Spirit upon him" (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). The sanctification of our Lord's human nature by the Holy Spirit is very explicitly taught in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/mark/1-10.htm">Mark 1:10, 12</a>; <a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href="/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1, 14, 18-21</a>, etc.; <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; <a href="/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath anointed me</span>. The "anointing" of Jesus was that sanctification of his human nature by the Holy Spirit, which commenced in the womb of the blessed Virgin (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), which continued as he grew to manhood (<a href="/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40, 52</a>), which was openly manifested at his baptism, and never ceased till he took his body and soul with him into heaven. Of this spiritual anointing, all material unction, whether under the Law (<a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-12, 30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15, 16</a>, etc.) or under the gospel (<a href="/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>; <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>), was symbolical or typical. <span class="cmt_word">To preach good tidings</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; and <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the meek</span> (see <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; and comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bind</span> <span class="cmt_word">up the broken-hearted</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, where this is declared to be the office of Jehovah himself).

To proclaim liberty to the captives. This was one of the special offices of "the Servant" (see <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). The "captivity" intended is doubtless that of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And the opening of the prison to them that are bound</span>.
