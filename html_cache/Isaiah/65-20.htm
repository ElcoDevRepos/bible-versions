In biblical history, the death of infants was a frequent tragedy due to disease and lack of medical knowledge. This promise of extended life for infants reflects a restoration of creation to its intended state, reminiscent of the pre-fall world in Genesis. It aligns with prophetic visions of a new heaven and new earth, where suffering and death are eradicated (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><b>or an old man fail to live out his years</b><br>The expectation that the elderly will live out their full lifespan indicates a reversal of the curse of death introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. In ancient Israel, long life was seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). This promise suggests a return to the conditions of the patriarchs, who lived for centuries, and symbolizes the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. It also points to the Messianic age, where Jesus Christ, the "Ancient of Days" (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>), reigns and restores life.<p><b>For the youth will die at a hundred years</b><br>This hyperbolic statement emphasizes the dramatic increase in lifespan, where even a hundred years is considered youthful. It reflects the prophetic vision of a renewed creation where death is not premature. This imagery is consistent with the eschatological hope found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/zechariah/8-4.htm">Zechariah 8:4-5</a>, where old men and women sit in the streets, and children play, symbolizing peace and prosperity.<p><b>and he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed</b><br>In the cultural context of ancient Israel, dying young was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor or curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). This phrase underscores the transformation of societal norms in the prophesied future, where anything less than a full life is an anomaly. It highlights the comprehensive nature of God's redemptive plan, where the effects of sin and the curse are fully reversed through the work of Christ, who bore the curse on the cross (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nursing_infant.htm">Nursing Infant</a></b><br>Represents the most vulnerable and dependent stage of human life, highlighting the promise of longevity and health.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_man.htm">Old Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes the culmination of a full life, emphasizing the assurance of living out one's years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/youth.htm">Youth</a></b><br>In this context, refers to someone who is a hundred years old, illustrating the extended lifespan in the new creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/accursed.htm">Accursed</a></b><br>Indicates the rarity and abnormality of dying young in the prophesied era of blessing and prosperity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_heavens_and_new_earth.htm">New Heavens and New Earth</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/65.htm">Isaiah 65</a>, describing a future time of peace and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_restoration.htm">Promise of Restoration</a></b><br><a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a> assures believers of God's plan to restore creation to a state of peace and longevity.

(Comp. <a href="/zechariah/8-4.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.">Zechariah 8:4</a>.) He who dies at the age of a hundred will be thought of as dying young; even the sinner, dying before his time as the penalty of his guilt, shall live out the measure of a century. The noticeable fact is that sin is thought of as not altogether extinct--as still appearing, though under altered conditions, even in the restored Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no more thence an infant</span> <span class="cmt_word">of days;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there shall not go from the new Jerusalem into the unseen world any infant of a few days old.

The general rule shall be, that old men shall "fill their days," or attain to patriarchal longevity. Even the sinner, who is under the curse of God, shall not be cut off till he is a hundred. What is most remarkable in the description is that death and sin are represented as still continuing. Death was spoken of as "swallowed up in victory" in one of the earlier descriptions of Messiah's kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/65-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">longer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will a nursing infant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5764.htm">Strong's 5764: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sucking child, suckling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">live</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a few days,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or an old man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;z&#257;&#183;q&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
