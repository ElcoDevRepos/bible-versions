Historically, Ai was a significant location during the conquest of Canaan under Joshua (Joshua 7-8). The mention of Assyria entering Aiath suggests a strategic military advance, as Ai was situated on a route leading to Jerusalem. This movement signifies the threat posed by Assyria to the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.<p><b>and passed through Migron</b><br>Migron is a location mentioned in the context of Saul's reign (<a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>), indicating its historical significance. The passage of the Assyrian army through Migron highlights their relentless advance towards Jerusalem. This movement underscores the impending danger and the swift progression of the Assyrian forces, emphasizing the urgency of the situation for the inhabitants of Judah.<p><b>storing their supplies at Michmash</b><br>Michmash was a strategic location in the tribal territory of Benjamin, known for its rugged terrain and narrow passes (<a href="/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a>). The storing of supplies here suggests a preparation for a prolonged campaign, indicating the Assyrians' intent to establish a stronghold. This action reflects the military strategy of securing resources and ensuring logistical support for their operations. Michmash's mention also connects to the earlier biblical narrative where Jonathan, Saul's son, achieved a significant victory over the Philistines (1 Samuel 14), highlighting the area's historical military importance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aiath.htm">Aiath</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the context of the Assyrian invasion.

Mentioning it first places the Assyrian armies alarmingly close to Judah&#8217;s heartland.<p>&#8226; The march fulfills God&#8217;s declaration that He would use Assyria as &#8220;the rod of My anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>) to discipline a rebellious people.<p>&#8226; Just as the LORD earlier allowed enemies to approach His own city in <a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>, so here He permits Assyria to reach Aiath&#8212;yet always on a leash He controls (<a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and passed through Migron</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and passed through Migron&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>b)<p>&#8226; Migron lies only a handful of miles farther south (<a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>). The narrative pace quickens: the enemy surges unopposed.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s present-tense description makes the advance feel immediate, underscoring Judah&#8217;s helplessness apart from the LORD (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This step echoes previous warnings that judgment would sweep &#8220;like a mighty river&#8221; through the land (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>), sparing nothing until God Himself intervenes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>storing their supplies at Michmash</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;storing their supplies at Michmash.&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>c)<p>&#8226; Michmash was a strategic highland town (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5-23</a>). Stockpiling supplies here signals Assyria&#8217;s confidence in a long siege against Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; The detail confirms a literal, historical march&#8212;God wanted His people to grasp that the threat was real, not symbolic (<a href="/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even as the invader digs in, the LORD already has a timetable for their downfall: &#8220;Yet today they will halt at Nob&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>) and soon be broken (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>), just as He later shattered Sennacherib overnight (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> paints three rapid brushstrokes&#8212;entry at Aiath, passage through Migron, provisioning at Michmash&#8212;to show Assyria&#8217;s relentless advance toward Jerusalem. Each geographic marker heightens tension while simultaneously spotlighting God&#8217;s sovereign purpose: He allows the enemy to march for discipline, yet He sets clear boundaries and guarantees deliverance. The verse invites us to trust that, even when threats loom at the doorstep, the LORD remains firmly in control and will ultimately defend His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">He is come to Aiath . . .</span>--There is an obvious break between this and the preceding verse, and a new section begins, connected with the former by unity of subject, both referring to Sargon's invasion of Judah. That such an invasion took place at or about the time of that king's attack on Ashdod (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>) the inscriptions leave no doubt. The Koujunyik cylinder names the king of Judah as having joined with the king of Ashdod; and in another, Sargon speaks of himself as "the subduer of the lands of Judah" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Inscriptions, </span>xxxiii. 8). There is nothing in the passage itself to determine whether <a href="/context/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28-32</a> are predictive or historical, or when they were first uttered. Assuming that the Messianic prophecy of chap 11 is in close connection with them, it seems most probable that now, as in the earlier attack of Pekah and Rezin (Isaiah 7), as in the later invasion of Sennacherib (Isaiah 37), the bright vision of the future came to sustain the people when they were at their lowest point of depression. This would obviously be when Sargon's armies were actually encamped round the city, when they had reached the last halting-place of the itinerary which Isaiah traces out. We may infer accordingly that the Assyrian armies were then at or near Nob, and that the prophet, supplied, either by human agency or supernaturally, with a knowledge of the movements of the Assyrian armies, describes their progress to a terrified and expectant people, and fixes the final goal. That progress we now have to trace. (1) Aiath is probably identical with the Ai of <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2</a>, the Aija of <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm" title="The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelled at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Bethel. (2) Migron. The route taken was not the usual one, but passed over three valleys, probably with a view to surprise Jerusalem by an unexpected attack. The modern name, <span class= "ital">Bure Magrun, </span>survives, a short distance from Bethel. (3) Michmash. Now <span class= "ital">Muchmas, </span>on the east side of the Migron valley. Here the carriages, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">baggage </span>(<a href="/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>), the <span class= "ital">impedimenta, </span>of the Assyrian army was left behind that the host might advance with greater rapidity to immediate action. (4) Geba, in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>). Here, after defiling through the "passages," probably the gorge of <span class= "ital">Wady Suweinit </span>memorable for Jonathan s adventure (<a href="/context/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4-5</a>), the army halted and encamped. (5) The panic spread rapidly to Ramah, memorable as the chief residence of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:17</a>). (6) The inhabitants of Gibeah, still retaining in its name its old association with the hero-king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm" title="Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.">1Samuel 11:4</a>), left their town deserted and undefended. (7) Gallim, not now identifiable, but mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a>. (8) Laieh, not the northern city of that name (<a href="/judges/18-29.htm" title="And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.">Judges 18:29</a>), but near Jerusalem. Read, <span class= "ital">Listen, O Laish, </span>as if to the tramp of the armies as they passed. (9) Anathoth; about four miles north of Jerusalem, the birth-place of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). There is a special pathos in the prophet's accents, a<span class= "ital">niyah Anathoth. </span>A various reading adopted by many critics gives, <span class= "ital">Answer, O Anathoth. </span>(10) Madmenah, or Madmen, appears in <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, as a Moabite city. The name ("dung-hill") was, however, not an uncommon one. It is named (<a href="/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>) as one of the south-eastern cities of Judah. (11) The people of Gebim ("water-pits;" locality not identified) <span class= "ital">gather their goods for flight. </span>(12) At last the army reaches Nob, memorable as having been one of the resting-places of the Tabernacle in the time of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?">1Samuel 21:1</a>). The site has not been identified with certainty, but it was obviously a position that commanded Jerusalem, between it and Anathoth, probably not far from the hill <span class= "ital">Scopos </span>("watch-tower") where Titus and his troops encamped during the siege of Jerusalem. The prophet's narrative leaves the invader there shaking his hand, as with defiant menace, against the holy city. For "that day," read <span class= "ital">this very day, </span>fixing, as it were, the very hour at which Isaiah spoke. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - This graphic portraiture of the march of an Assyrian army on Jerusalem is probably not historic, but prophetic. Isaiah sees it in vision (<a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription "<span class="accented">conqueror</span> of the land of Judah" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is come to Aiath</span>. "Aiath" is probably Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-28</a>), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. <span class="cmt_word">He is passed to Migron</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he has passed through Migron</span>. "Migron" is mentioned as a village in the territory of Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>); but the Migron of this passage must have been further to the north. <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid up his carriages</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has left his baggage-train." Michmash was about seven miles nearly due north of Jerusalem. The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (<a href="/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4-13</a>), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/10-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Assyria] has entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aiath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;ay&#183;ya&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5857.htm">Strong's 5857: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ai -- a Canaanite city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and passed through</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Migron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;mi&#7713;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
