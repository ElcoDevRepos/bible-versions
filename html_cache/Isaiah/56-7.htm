The "holy mountain" is often identified with Mount Zion in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and the location of the Temple. In biblical context, mountains are frequently associated with divine encounters and revelations (e.g., Mount Sinai). This promise extends beyond Israel to include foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, indicating a future gathering of all believers. This is prophetic of the eschatological hope where all nations will worship God together, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>.<p><b>and make them joyful in My house of prayer.</b><br>The "house of prayer" refers to the Temple, which was intended to be a place of communion with God. Joy in worship is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the delight and fulfillment found in God's presence (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). This joy is not limited to the Israelites but is available to all who seek God sincerely. The New Testament echoes this inclusivity, as Jesus cleanses the Temple and reaffirms its purpose as a house of prayer for all nations (<a href="/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>). This joy is a foretaste of the eternal joy believers will experience in God's presence.<p><b>Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar,</b><br>In the Old Testament, burnt offerings and sacrifices were central to worship and atonement. Acceptance of these offerings signifies God's approval and the restoration of relationship between God and worshipers. This phrase underscores the inclusivity of God's covenant, extending acceptance to all who come to Him in faith. The altar symbolizes the place of atonement and reconciliation, prefiguring Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross, which makes all believers acceptable to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>for My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the universal scope of God's salvation plan. The Temple, as God's dwelling place, was meant to be accessible to all people, not just Israel. This vision is fulfilled in the New Testament, where the Church becomes the spiritual house of God, open to all who believe in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). The phrase "for all the nations" highlights the prophetic vision of a unified worship community, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the vision of every nation, tribe, and tongue worshiping before God's throne (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising inclusion and acceptance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_mountain.htm">Holy Mountain</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's presence and the place of worship, often associated with Jerusalem and the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_prayer.htm">House of Prayer</a></b><br>Refers to the temple, a place dedicated to worship and communication with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Represents all peoples, indicating the inclusivity of God's promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings_and_sacrifices.htm">Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices</a></b><br>Traditional forms of worship and atonement in the Old Testament, symbolizing devotion and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_worship.htm">Inclusivity in Worship</a></b><br>God's invitation extends to all nations, emphasizing the universal nature of His love and the call to worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_presence.htm">Joy in God's Presence</a></b><br>True joy is found in communion with God, as He promises to make His people joyful in His house of prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acceptance_of_offerings.htm">Acceptance of Offerings</a></b><br>God values sincere worship and devotion, accepting the offerings of those who seek Him with a pure heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_central_to_worship.htm">Prayer as Central to Worship</a></b><br>The temple is designated as a house of prayer, highlighting the importance of prayer in our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_in_christ.htm">Fulfillment in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' actions and teachings affirm the prophecy, showing that He is the fulfillment of God's promise to include all nations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_56_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 56:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_make_our_church_a_global_prayer_hub.htm">How can we make our church a "house of prayer for all nations"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_56_7_on_God_s_inclusive_worship.htm">What does Isaiah 56:7 teach about God's inclusivity in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_56_7_to_Jesus_temple_act.htm">How does Isaiah 56:7 connect with Jesus' cleansing of the temple?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_prayer_in_life.htm">In what ways can we prioritize prayer in our personal and communal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Align_worship_with_God_s_desires_6.htm">How can we ensure our worship aligns with God's desires in Isaiah 56:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_house_of_prayer_for_all.htm">What does Isaiah 56:7 mean by "house of prayer for all nations"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_56_7_and_Gentile_worship_link.htm">How does Isaiah 56:7 relate to the inclusion of Gentiles in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_house_of_prayer_important.htm">Why is the concept of a "house of prayer" significant in Isaiah 56:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_56.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 56?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_isaiah_56_7_conflict_with_ot_texts.htm">Does Isaiah 56:7&#8217;s &#8220;house of prayer for all nations&#8221; conflict with other Old Testament texts that emphasize separation from foreigners?
