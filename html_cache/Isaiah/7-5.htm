Historically, Aram was a significant power in the Near East, often in conflict with Israel. The mention of Aram here highlights the geopolitical tensions of the time, as Aram frequently sought to expand its influence over neighboring territories. This context is crucial for understanding the alliances and hostilities that shaped the political landscape during the period of the divided kingdom.<p><b>along with Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim is a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel, often called Ephraim after its dominant tribe. The alliance between Aram and Ephraim signifies a coalition against the southern kingdom of Judah. This alliance was formed during the Syro-Ephraimite War, a pivotal conflict in which these two northern powers sought to pressure Judah into joining their resistance against the Assyrian Empire. The mention of Ephraim underscores the internal divisions within the Israelite people, as the northern and southern kingdoms were often at odds.<p><b>and the son of Remaliah,</b><br>The son of Remaliah refers to Pekah, the king of Israel at the time. Pekah's reign was marked by political instability and military aggression, particularly against Judah. His alliance with Aram was part of a broader strategy to resist Assyrian domination. Pekah's actions are significant in the biblical narrative as they set the stage for the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom, which was conquered by Assyria in 722 BC.<p><b>has plotted your ruin,</b><br>The plotting of ruin indicates a deliberate and hostile intent against Judah. This phrase captures the essence of the threat faced by King Ahaz of Judah, as he was confronted with a formidable alliance seeking to dethrone him and install a puppet ruler. The political intrigue and military threats of this period are central to understanding the prophetic messages delivered by Isaiah, who urged trust in God rather than foreign alliances.<p><b>saying:</b><br>The introduction of direct speech suggests a specific plan or declaration made by the coalition of Aram and Ephraim. This sets the stage for the subsequent verses, where the intentions and strategies of these adversaries are revealed. The prophetic narrative often uses such direct speech to convey the immediacy and seriousness of the threats faced by God's people, as well as to highlight the divine response and assurance provided through the prophet Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>Also known as Syria, Aram was a kingdom located in modern-day Syria.
