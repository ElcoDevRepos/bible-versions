The prophet Isaiah, speaking on behalf of God, shows that divine judgment is not devoid of empathy. Moab, a descendant of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), often had a tumultuous relationship with Israel. Despite their enmity, the heart of God, as revealed through the prophet, mourns for their impending doom. This compassion mirrors the heart of Christ, who wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><b>her fugitives flee as far as Zoar,</b><br>Zoar is a city associated with the story of Lot's escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22-23</a>). It represents a place of refuge, yet here it is depicted as a destination for Moabite refugees fleeing destruction. This highlights the severity of Moab's plight, as they seek safety in a city historically linked to divine judgment. The mention of Zoar underscores the complete reversal of fortune for Moab, once a powerful nation.<p><b>as far as Eglath-shelishiyah.</b><br>Eglath-shelishiyah is a location whose exact identification is uncertain, but it is thought to be a place of significance in Moab. The name itself, meaning "the third Eglath," suggests a notable site, possibly a city or a landmark. The reference to this location indicates the extent of the Moabite flight, emphasizing the widespread panic and desperation among the people.<p><b>With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith;</b><br>The ascent of Luhith is a steep climb, symbolizing the arduous journey of the Moabite refugees. The weeping signifies profound grief and despair, as they are forced to leave their homes. This imagery of ascent amidst sorrow is reminiscent of the "valley of the shadow of death" (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), where the faithful seek God's comfort. The path to Luhith becomes a metaphor for the trials faced by those under judgment.<p><b>they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.</b><br>Horonaim is another Moabite city, and the road leading to it becomes a path of lamentation. The destruction lamented here is both physical and spiritual, as the Moabites face the consequences of their actions. This echoes the broader biblical theme of repentance and the call to turn back to God. The lamentation on this road parallels the cries of Israel in their own times of distress, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>. The road to Horonaim serves as a reminder of the ultimate hope found in God's mercy and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Though Moab is under judgment (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15&#8211;16</a>), God&#8217;s heart is not cold; He grieves over sin&#8217;s ruin (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This shows that divine justice and divine mercy coexist. God&#8217;s sorrow over Moab parallels Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), underscoring that He &#8220;does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse calls us to mirror God&#8217;s compassion, even toward those who oppose us (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her fugitives flee as far as Zoar</b><p>&#8226; Judgment scatters the Moabites southward toward Zoar, a town near the Dead Sea that once sheltered Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The flight highlights the desperation produced by God-ordained discipline&#8212;there is no lasting refuge apart from Him (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare Israel&#8217;s earlier exodus out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>) and Judah&#8217;s later flight from Babylonian invasion (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>). God&#8217;s people, too, have known what it is to run, yet the Lord remained their only sure sanctuary (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As far as Eglath-shelishiyah</b><p>&#8226; The name means &#8220;third-calf,&#8221; probably marking a small, remote settlement.

Judgment apart from repentance brings only grief (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; For the church, Luhith warns that the path chosen apart from God becomes progressively harder (<a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim</b><p>&#8226; Horonaim, another Moabite city (<a href="/jeremiah/48-3.htm">Jeremiah 48:3, 5</a>), hears cries of ruin before the refugees even arrive, showing how terror runs ahead of them.<p>&#8226; The phrase fulfills earlier prophetic warnings that disaster would come swiftly (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65&#8211;67</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet lament without turning to the Lord leaves sorrow unresolved.

Every phrase reveals a just God whose heart still aches over human rebellion. His compassion calls us to share His grief for the lost, while His judgment reminds us that no flight can outrun Him.

Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.">Genesis 19:22</a>), in the wild scare as of a frightened heifer as yet untamed by the yoke (<a href="/jeremiah/31-18.htm" title="I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.">Jeremiah 31:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11</a>). The English "fugitives" answers to the marginal reading of the Hebrew, the text of which (followed by the Vulg.) gives, "his bars reach unto Zoar;" but it is not easy to connect this with the context.<p><span class= "bld">By the mounting up of Luhith . . .</span>--No city has been identified as bearing this name. Probably "the <span class= "ital">ascent of Luhith</span>" (the name may indicate a staircase of boards) was the well-known approach (<a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm" title="For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.">Jeremiah 48:5</a>) to a Moabite sanctuary. Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Onomast.</span>) speaks of it as between Zoar and Areopolis (Rabbath Moab). Horonaim (here and in <a href="/jeremiah/48-3.htm" title="A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.">Jeremiah 48:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm" title="For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.">Jeremiah 48:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>) is as little known as its companion. The name, which in Hebrew means "two caverns," is, perhaps, descriptive of the nature of the sanctuary. The point of the description is that the fugitives when they reach Horonaim, are met with the cry of destruction, "All is over." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall cry out for Moab</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 11</a>). The prophet sympathizes with the sufferings of Moab, as a kindred people (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and perhaps as having, in the person of Ruth, furnished an ancestress to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His fugitives</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her fugitives</span>. The <span class="accented">country</span> is here personified, instead of the <span class="accented">people</span>, the former being feminine, the latter masculine. <span class="cmt_word">Shall flee</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto Zoar</span>. Zoar, the "little" town, spared for Lot's sake (<a href="/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>), is placed by some at the northern, by others at the southern, extremity of the Dead Sea. The present passage makes in favor of the more southern site. <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old</span>. Those who defend this rendering refer the simile either to Zest, or to Moab, or to the fugitives. Having regard to the parallel passage of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 48:34), we may pronounce the last explanation to be the best. The resemblance to the heifer will consist in the cries uttered. To ninny critics, however, this idea appears harsh, and the alternative is proposed of regarding <span class="accented">Eglath -</span> the word translated "heifer" - as a place, and the epithet, "of three years <span class="accented">old</span>," as really meaning "the third." Attempts are made to show the existence of three Eglaths in these parts; but they are not very successful; nor is any instance adduced of a city being distinguished from others of the same name by a numerical suffix. The rendering of the Authorized Version may therefore stand, the comparison being regarded as one of the fugitive Moabites to a heifer in its third year, "<span class="accented">rushing</span> along with loud, hopeless bellowings" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">By the mounting up of Luhith</span>. This ascent has not been identified. It should have been on the way from Moab proper to Zoar. <span class="cmt_word">The way of Horonaim</span>. On the Moabite Stone Horonaim is mentioned as a town of the Edomites attacked and taken by Mesha (11:31-33). It lay probably south or southeast of the Dead Sea. The Moabites, flying kern their invaders, seek a refuge in the territories of Edom and Judah, weeping and wailing as they go. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lib&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
