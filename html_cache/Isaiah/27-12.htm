It is a common expression in prophetic literature, indicating a significant event in God's redemptive plan. In Isaiah, "that day" frequently points to the eschatological future when God will establish His kingdom.<p><b>the LORD will thresh</b><br>Threshing is an agricultural metaphor used to describe judgment and purification. In ancient times, threshing involved separating grain from chaff, symbolizing God's process of separating the righteous from the wicked. This imagery suggests a time of divine judgment and cleansing.<p><b>from the flowing Euphrates</b><br>The Euphrates River was one of the great rivers of the ancient Near East, marking the northeastern boundary of the Promised Land. It represents the extent of God's dominion and the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p><b>to the Wadi of Egypt</b><br>The Wadi of Egypt, often identified with the Brook of Egypt or the modern-day Wadi El-Arish, marks the southwestern boundary of the Promised Land. This phrase indicates the full extent of the land promised to Israel, from the Euphrates to the border of Egypt.<p><b>and you, O Israelites,</b><br>This addresses the people of Israel, God's chosen nation. The focus on Israel highlights God's covenant relationship with them and His commitment to their restoration and redemption.<p><b>will be gathered one by one.</b><br>The imagery of gathering "one by one" emphasizes the personal and meticulous nature of God's redemption. It suggests a careful and deliberate process, ensuring that none of His people are overlooked. This gathering can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate gathering of God's people in the end times, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's sovereignty and active role in the redemption and gathering of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/euphrates.htm">Euphrates</a></b><br>A major river in the ancient Near East, symbolizing the northern boundary of the Promised Land and often associated with the Assyrian empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wadi_of_egypt.htm">Wadi of Egypt</a></b><br>A dry riverbed or valley that marks the southern boundary of the Promised Land, often associated with the border of Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are the recipients of God's promise of gathering and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing.htm">Threshing</a></b><br>An agricultural process used metaphorically here to describe God's action of separating and gathering His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_gathering.htm">God's Sovereignty in Gathering</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the destiny of His people.

Throughout Isaiah, this phrase anticipates the climactic &#8220;Day of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11&#8211;12</a>; 13:6, 9) when judgment and restoration intertwine. <a href="/zephaniah/3-16.htm">Zephaniah 3:16&#8211;20</a> links that day with both the purging of evil and the rejoicing of God&#8217;s people. Paul sees its ultimate fulfillment in Israel&#8217;s future salvation (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25-27</a>). The wording signals more than a vague era; it calls us to look expectantly toward a literal future event when God&#8217;s covenant promises come to visible fruition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD will thresh</b><p>Threshing separates grain from chaff, an image of decisive divine action. Isaiah uses the same motif in 28:27&#8211;29 to show God&#8217;s wisdom in discipline; John the Baptist applies it to Messiah&#8217;s coming judgment (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14-16</a> pictures a reaping of the earth, echoing this threshing language. Here, the LORD Himself&#8212;not a delegated agent&#8212;takes up the threshing tool, assuring that the process is both perfectly just and perfectly redemptive. Those aligned with Him are preserved; all that is worthless is cast away. The figure reassures the faithful that no enemy, circumstance, or remnant of sin can escape His winnowing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt</b><p>These two landmarks mark the broad sweep of the promised land, echoing <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a> where God covenanted with Abram &#8220;from the River of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.&#8221; They appear again in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a> and <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a> as shorthand for Israel&#8217;s fullest territorial extent. The promise is literal: God will actively reclaim and purify every inch of the land He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, demonstrating His unwavering faithfulness to His word despite centuries of exile and dispersion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you, O Israelites</b><p>The address is direct and personal. God speaks to ethnic Israel, the physical descendants of Jacob, affirming their ongoing identity (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>; <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1-2</a>). Though many modern readers spiritualize these promises, the text consistently distinguishes Israel from the nations. <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> underscores this covenantal relationship: &#8220;Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine&#8221;. The verse underscores that Israel&#8217;s story has not been eclipsed by the Church but is heading toward a divinely orchestrated climax that will bless the whole world (<a href="/zechariah/8-23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be gathered one by one</b><p>God&#8217;s rescue is not a mass sweep that overlooks individuals; it is a personal search-and-gather operation. <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> pictures the LORD reaching out His hand &#8220;again a second time to recover the remnant of His people.&#8221; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-13</a> portrays Him as a shepherd who &#8220;will search for My sheep and seek them out.&#8221; Jesus echoes the same heart in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>, leaving ninety-nine to find the one. The phrase &#8220;one by one&#8221; assures every Israelite&#8212;scattered to the ends of the earth (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>)&#8212;that none is too remote for His grasp. The regathering is meticulous, compassionate, and unfailing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a> looks forward to a literal day when the LORD Himself intervenes: sifting humanity, reclaiming Israel&#8217;s full inheritance, and gathering His covenant people with personal care. He will thresh away all that opposes His purposes, expand Israel&#8217;s borders to the Euphrates and the Wadi of Egypt, and bring each dispersed Israelite home individually. The verse affirms God&#8217;s absolute faithfulness&#8212;geographically, nationally, and personally&#8212;assuring us that every promise written in Scripture will stand exactly as spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The Lord shall beat off . . .</span>--The English Version conveys scarcely any meaning.
