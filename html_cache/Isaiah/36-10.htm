The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and their strategy of psychological warfare, which included claiming divine sanction for their conquests. The Rabshakeh's question implies that the Assyrian invasion is divinely ordained, suggesting that resistance is futile. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern belief that military success was a sign of divine favor. Theologically, this challenges the Israelites' understanding of their covenant relationship with God, as they believed that God would protect Jerusalem, the city of David. This moment tests the faith of Hezekiah and the people of Judah, as they must discern whether this claim is true or a tactic to demoralize them.<p><b>The LORD Himself said to me, &#8216;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The Rabshakeh's assertion that the LORD commanded the Assyrian invasion is a bold claim intended to undermine the confidence of the people of Judah in their God. Historically, Assyrian kings often claimed divine support for their campaigns, and this statement could be seen as an attempt to equate the God of Israel with the gods of other nations, who were believed to be subject to the will of the Assyrian empire. This claim is not supported by any prophetic word from the LORD to the Assyrians, and it contrasts with the messages of the prophets Isaiah and Micah, who emphasized God's sovereignty and justice. Theologically, this statement can be seen as a test of faith, as it challenges the Israelites to trust in God's promises despite the apparent evidence to the contrary. In the broader biblical narrative, this moment foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of Jerusalem, highlighting God's faithfulness and the futility of opposing His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, who sent his field commander to Jerusalem to demand its surrender.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The field commander of the Assyrian army, who delivered the message to the people of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Assyrian army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose will and approval are central to the events described.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God can use even pagan nations to accomplish His purposes.

The enemy often mixes truth with lies to sow doubt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it?</b><p>&#8226; He implies that resistance to Assyria equals resistance to God Himself.<p>&#8226; There is a grain of truth: God had indeed raised Assyria as His instrument of discipline (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the assumption is twisted: God&#8217;s sovereignty over nations never excuses pride or cruelty (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Key takeaway: discernment is needed when someone cites God&#8217;s name. Compare Paul&#8217;s warning about &#8220;another gospel&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD Himself said to me</b><p>&#8226; The claim of direct revelation (&#8220;The LORD Himself said to me&#8221;) is unverified.

While God used Assyria as a rod of discipline, the boast distorts His true purpose and ignores His covenant with David. The verse warns believers to test every claim made in God&#8217;s name, trust His sovereign plan, and remember that He sets limits on every power arrayed against His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Am I now come up without the Lord . . .</span>--The words may be simply an empty boast. Possibly, however, Isaiah's teaching that it was Jehovah who brought the King of Assyria into Judah, and used him as an instrument (<a href="/context/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17-18</a>), had become known, or Sennacherib may have dreamt, or have said that he had dreamt, that the God of Judah, irritated with the destruction of the high places, had given him this mission. He assumes the character of a defender of the faith. The inscriptions of Sennacherib are, it may be noted, conspicuous for like assertions. He delights, apparently, to claim a Divine sanction for the wars in which he is engaged (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 25, 9:23).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Jehovah said unto me</span>, <span class="accented">Go up</span>, etc. (camp. <a href="/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>, where Necho tells Josiah that "God commanded" his expedition against Carchemish). The heathen monarchs frequently represented themselves as directed to make war on a nation by God, or by some particular god. Piankhi Mer-amman says, "I am born of the loins. created from the egg, of the Deity... I have not acted without his knowing; he ordained that I should act" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. p. 91). Mesha, King of Moab, declares, "Chemosh said to me, Go and take Nebo [in war] against Israel" (ibid., vol. 11. p. 166). Asshur is generally represented as commanding the expeditions of the Assyrian kings (ibid., vol. 1. pp. 21, 48, 60, etc.). Still, it is surprising that Sennacherib should mention "Jehovah" as the God from whom he had received the order to attack Hezekiah, and we may suspect that the term which he actually employed was <span class="accented">Ilu</span>, "God," and that either Rahshakeh, or the reporter of the speech, substituted "Jehovah" as more intelligible to the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/36-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
