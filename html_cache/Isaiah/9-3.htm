Historically, this can be seen as a reference to the growth and prosperity under the reigns of kings like David and Solomon, when Israel's territory and influence were at their peak. Theologically, it points to God's covenant faithfulness and His promises to Abraham about making his descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The increase in joy is often associated with divine favor and blessing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/126-2.htm">Psalm 126:2-3</a>, where the return from exile is marked by joy and laughter. This joy is not merely circumstantial but rooted in the fulfillment of God's promises and His presence among His people.<p><b>The people rejoice before You as they rejoice at harvest time,</b><br>The imagery of harvest is significant in the biblical context, symbolizing abundance, provision, and God's faithfulness in providing for His people. Harvest festivals, such as the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), were times of great celebration and gratitude to God for His provision (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). This phrase suggests a deep, communal joy that is both spiritual and physical, as the people recognize God's hand in their prosperity. The joy before God indicates worship and acknowledgment of His sovereignty and goodness. This also foreshadows the ultimate harvest of souls in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the fields being ripe for harvest (<a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>).<p><b>as men rejoice in dividing the plunder.</b><br>This phrase evokes the joy and relief experienced after a victorious battle, where the spoils of war are shared among the victors. In the ancient Near Eastern context, dividing plunder was a common practice following military success, symbolizing triumph and the end of conflict. Biblically, this can be connected to the victories God granted Israel over their enemies, such as in the time of Joshua or during the reign of King David. Spiritually, it points to the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as a conquering king (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>). The joy in dividing the plunder is a metaphor for the peace and rest that come from God's deliverance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation_of_israel.htm">The Nation of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, representing God's chosen people who are promised growth and joy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message of hope and restoration to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_time.htm">Harvest Time</a></b><br>A significant event symbolizing abundance and God's provision, often associated with joy and celebration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dividing_the_plunder.htm">Dividing the Plunder</a></b><br>A metaphor for victory and the spoils of war, symbolizing triumph and the joy that follows deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of the nation's enlargement and joy, the one before whom the people rejoice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_provision.htm">Joy in God's Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that true joy comes from God's provision and blessings, much like the joy of harvest time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_and_deliverance.htm">Victory and Deliverance</a></b><br>Understand that spiritual victories bring joy akin to dividing the plunder, as God delivers us from sin and adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/growth_and_enlargement.htm">Growth and Enlargement</a></b><br>Reflect on how God desires to enlarge our spiritual territory, increasing our capacity for joy and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing_in_god's_presence.htm">Rejoicing in God's Presence</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of rejoicing before God, acknowledging His role in our lives and communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_celebration.htm">Community and Celebration</a></b><br>Encourage communal joy and celebration, as seen in the shared experiences of harvest and victory.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_9_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 9:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_3_God_s_joy_abundance_promise.htm">How does Isaiah 9:3 illustrate God's promise of joy and abundance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_multiplied_nation.htm">What historical context helps us understand the "multiplied the nation" phrase?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_3_Faith_in_hardship.htm">How can Isaiah 9:3 inspire our faith during times of personal hardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_9_3_to_joy_blessing_verses.htm">Connect Isaiah 9:3 with other scriptures about God's blessings and joy.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Isaiah_9_3_joy_daily.htm">How can we apply the joy of Isaiah 9:3 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_3_s_link_to_Messiah_s_prophecy.htm">How does Isaiah 9:3 relate to the prophecy of the Messiah's coming?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_joy_increased_in_Isaiah_9_3.htm">Why does Isaiah 9:3 mention increased joy and rejoicing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Isaiah_9_3.htm">What historical context surrounds the prophecy in Isaiah 9:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_was_jesus'_purpose_on_earth.htm">What was Jesus' purpose on Earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_isaiah_18_4's_imagery_align.htm">Isaiah 18:4: How does the imagery of God quietly observing nations square with other passages where God is depicted as actively intervening?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_is_god_both_protector_and_punisher.htm">According to Judges 2:14, God allowed Israel to be plundered;

In the near view He preserved a remnant after Assyrian oppression (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>), but the fuller horizon is Messiah&#8217;s kingdom where the family of faith multiplies into &#8220;a great nation&#8221; just as God promised Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). Christ&#8217;s resurrection and Pentecost began that massive growth&#8212;&#8220;about three thousand souls were added&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>), and John later saw &#8220;a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). The enlargement is literal, global, and permanent, displaying the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and increased its joy</b><p>Growth alone would be hollow without gladness. God personally supplies it, turning former gloom (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>) into celebration.<p>&#8226; &#8220;You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and new wine abound&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; At the nativity the angel announced &#8220;good news of great joy&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus promised, &#8220;So your joy may be complete&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>).<p>The verse shows that joy is not self-generated; it rises because God Himself acts on behalf of His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people rejoice before You</b><p>The scene moves from national enlargement to personal worship. Joy is not merely about abundance; it is expressed &#8220;before You,&#8221; in God&#8217;s presence. David &#8220;danced before the LORD with all his might&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>), and the psalmist testifies, &#8220;In Your presence is fulness of joy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). Revelation echoes the theme: the redeemed &#8220;serve Him day and night in His temple&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). Isaiah highlights that real rejoicing is relational&#8212;face-to-face with the Lord who redeemed them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they rejoice at harvest time</b><p>The prophet uses an everyday picture his audience knew well. Harvest meant the hard work was finished, barns were full, and families were secure.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Joel links harvest to restoration: &#8220;The vats will overflow&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; James encourages patience &#8220;until the Lord&#8217;s coming&#8221; just as a farmer waits for &#8220;the precious fruit of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>).<p>Isaiah&#8217;s analogy tells us the coming salvation feels as concrete and satisfying as bringing in a bumper crop.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as men rejoice in dividing the plunder</b><p>Another vivid image: soldiers exulting after a decisive victory. God&#8217;s people celebrate because the battle is won for them.<p>&#8226; After the Red Sea, Israel sang, &#8220;The LORD is my strength&#8230; He has become my salvation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah later says of Messiah, &#8220;He will divide the spoils with the strong&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>).<p>&#8226; At the cross Jesus &#8220;disarmed the powers and authorities&#8230; triumphing over them&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p>The verse underlines total deliverance: enemies defeated, victory gifts shared, and every threat removed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a> paints a multi-layered portrait of God&#8217;s saving work. He enlarges His people, fills them with joy, brings them into His presence, satisfies them like an abundant harvest, and grants the thrill of ultimate victory. The promise was tasted in Israel&#8217;s history, fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s first coming, and will reach its fullest expression when His kingdom is openly established over all the earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy . . .</span>--Better, following the marginal reading of the Hebrew: <span class= "ital">Thou hast increased its joy. </span>The picture is one of unmingled brightness; the return as of a golden age, the population growing to an extent never attained before (comp. <a href="/isaiah/26-15.htm" title="You have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation: you are glorified: you had removed it far to all the ends of the earth.">Isaiah 26:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-27.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.">Jeremiah 31:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-11.htm" title="And I will multiply on you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better to you than at your beginnings: and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 36:11</a>), and scarcely admits of the dark shadow introduced by the reading of the text, unless, with some critics (Kay), we see in the words a contrast between the outward prosperity of the days of Solomon and Uzziah, in which there was no permanent joy, and the abundancy of joyfulness under the ideal king.<p><span class= "bld">They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest . . .</span>--The words "before thee" are significant. The gladness of the people is that of worshippers at a sacrificial feast (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm" title="And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>), who find the secret spring of blessing in their consciousness of the presence of Jehovah. So the New Testament writers speak of "rejoicing in the Lord" (<a href="/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.">Philippians 3:1</a>), of "joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>).

Dr. Kay defends this reading, and supposes a contrast of time between this clause and the next; he renders, "Thou <span class="accented">didst</span> multiply the nation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the days of Solomon and again in those of Uzziah) "and not increase the joy; <span class="accented">but now</span>," etc. The objection is that the verbs are all in the same tense, the simple preterit, and that there is nothing in the original corresponding to "but now." Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), which makes the passage simple and easy: "Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee," etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the joy in harvest.</span> "The joy in harvest" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have enlarged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;b&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the nation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
