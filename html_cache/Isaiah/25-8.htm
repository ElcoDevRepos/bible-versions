In the context of Isaiah, it reflects the hope of resurrection and eternal life, a promise fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ's resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). The imagery of "swallowing" suggests a complete and final defeat of death, echoing the prophetic vision of a new creation where death is no more (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). This promise is rooted in the covenantal faithfulness of God, who has the power to overcome the greatest enemy of humanity.<p><b>The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face</b><br>This phrase conveys God's compassion and personal care for His people. It is a promise of comfort and restoration, indicating a time when sorrow and suffering will be eradicated. The act of wiping away tears is intimate, suggesting a close relationship between God and His people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17 and 21</a>:4, where God promises to remove all pain and mourning in the new heaven and new earth. It reflects the deep love and mercy of God, who desires to heal and restore His creation.<p><b>and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth.</b><br>Here, the focus is on the vindication and restoration of God's people. Historically, Israel faced disgrace and shame due to exile and oppression by foreign nations. This promise assures that God will restore their honor and remove their shame, a theme also seen in <a href="/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19-20</a>. It points to a future where God's people are no longer subject to humiliation but are instead exalted and honored. This removal of disgrace is not limited to Israel but extends to all who are part of God's covenant community, highlighting the universal scope of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>For the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and authority of the promise. When the LORD speaks, it is a guarantee that His words will come to pass, reflecting His sovereignty and faithfulness. This assurance is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God's declarations are seen as unchangeable and reliable (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). It serves as a reminder that God's promises are trustworthy and will be fulfilled in His perfect timing, providing hope and assurance to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to defeat death and bring comfort to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Personified as an enemy that will be swallowed up and defeated by God, symbolizing the ultimate victory over sin and mortality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, representing God's chosen people, who will experience redemption and the removal of disgrace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_earth.htm">The Whole Earth</a></b><br>Indicates the universal scope of God's redemptive plan, extending beyond Israel to all nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message of hope and restoration, speaking God's promises to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_over_death.htm">Victory Over Death</a></b><br>God's promise to swallow up death forever assures believers of eternal life through Christ.

Hosea, a contemporary, was inspired to write! "Will ransom Israel from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction" (Hosea 13:14); but otherwise this was the first announcement that death was to disappear and to cease to be a possibility. It was an enormous advance on the dim and vague conceptions of a future life hitherto current (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) to have such an announcement made as this. Hitherto men had been "through fear of death all their life subject to bondage" (<a href="/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>). Now they were taught that, in the resurrection-life, there would be no tear, no possibility of death. The joyous outburst of the apostle, when he quotes the present passage (2 Corinthians 15:54), is the natural thanksgiving song of reassured humanity, on recognizing its final deliverance from the unspeakable terror of death and annihilation. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces.</span> A recent commentator asks, "What place is left for tears?" But surely death is not the only cause of human mourning. Our own sins, the sins and sufferings of our dear ones, are the main provocatives of our tears. When it is promised, as here and in <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> and Revelation 21:4, that "there shall be no more pain, neither sorrow nor crying," the revelation is made that <span class="accented">there shall be no more</span> sin; for where sin is, sorrow must be. <span class="cmt_word">The rebuke of his people shall he take away</span>. It will be among the lesser satisfactions of the final condition of the saved that they are no longer subject to reproach. In this life they have to endure continually reproach, rebuke, contumely (<a href="/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50, 51</a>, etc.). In the resurrection-life they will be exempt from any such annoyance. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken it</span>. God's word has gone forth. There can be no retractation.
