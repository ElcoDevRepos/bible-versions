The "reservoir" likely alludes to the Pool of Siloam or similar waterworks attributed to King Hezekiah, who built a tunnel to bring water into the city from the Gihon Spring. This was a strategic move to ensure that the city could withstand an enemy siege. The "walls" indicate the fortifications of Jerusalem, emphasizing the city's preparation for defense. This action reflects human ingenuity and resourcefulness in the face of impending danger, but it also highlights a reliance on human efforts rather than divine intervention.<p><b>but you did not look to the One who made it</b><br>This part of the verse criticizes the people of Jerusalem for their failure to recognize God's sovereignty and providence. While they focused on physical preparations, they neglected to seek guidance and protection from God, who is the ultimate creator and sustainer. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on human strength and wisdom is contrasted with trust in God. The "One who made it" underscores God's role as the creator of all things, including the natural resources and the wisdom to use them.<p><b>or consider Him who planned it long ago</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's eternal wisdom and foreknowledge. The people of Jerusalem are admonished for not acknowledging God's overarching plan and purpose. The idea of God "planning it long ago" suggests His involvement in the history and destiny of His people. This connects to the biblical narrative of God's covenant with Israel and His promises to protect and guide them. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who fulfills God's redemptive plan. The failure to "consider" God indicates a spiritual blindness and a lack of faith, which is a recurring issue throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a> take place.
