It emphasizes the vast number of Israelites, highlighting God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant. However, it also sets the stage for the contrast between the multitude and the remnant, underscoring the seriousness of the impending judgment.<p><b>only a remnant will return</b><br>The concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God amidst judgment. This prophecy was partially fulfilled when a small number of Israelites returned from Babylonian exile (Ezra 2). Theologically, it points to God's grace and mercy, preserving a faithful group despite widespread unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of a remnant chosen by grace (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p><b>Destruction has been decreed</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine judgment that is both certain and purposeful. The historical context involves the Assyrian invasion, which was a tool of God's judgment against Israel's idolatry and injustice. The decree of destruction serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice.<p><b>overflowing with righteousness</b><br>Despite the harshness of the judgment, it is described as "overflowing with righteousness," suggesting that God's actions are just and morally right. This reflects the biblical theme that God's judgments are not arbitrary but are rooted in His holy character. It also points to the ultimate purpose of judgment, which is to bring about repentance and restoration, aligning with God's righteous standards. This righteousness is fully realized in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often referred to as His people.
