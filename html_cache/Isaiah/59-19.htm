In biblical context, "fear" often denotes a deep respect and recognition of God's power and authority. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. The name of the LORD represents His character and essence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> where God reveals Himself as "I AM." The universal fear of God's name suggests a future time of widespread acknowledgment of His sovereignty, possibly pointing to eschatological events.<p><b>where the sun sets, and His glory where it rises</b><br>This phrase indicates the global recognition of God's majesty, from the west to the east. It reflects the universality of God's dominion, as seen in <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>, which declares that the LORD's name is to be praised from the rising of the sun to its setting. The imagery of the sun rising and setting underscores the idea of God's eternal presence and the spread of His glory across the earth. This can also be seen as a prophetic vision of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ's reign will be acknowledged worldwide.<p><b>For He will come like a raging flood</b><br>The imagery of a flood conveys overwhelming power and unstoppable force. In biblical history, floods often symbolize judgment and cleansing, as seen in the account of Noah in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>. This phrase suggests a divine intervention that is both powerful and purifying. The flood metaphor can also be linked to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God's Spirit is poured out on all people, leading to transformation and renewal.<p><b>driven by the breath of the LORD</b><br>The "breath of the LORD" signifies the Spirit of God, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. In <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, God breathes life into Adam, indicating the life-giving power of His Spirit. Similarly, in <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a>, the breath of God brings life to dry bones, symbolizing spiritual revival. This phrase highlights the divine origin and impetus behind the coming flood, emphasizing that it is God's Spirit that empowers and directs His actions. The breath of the LORD is also a type of Christ, who, in <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>, breathes on His disciples, imparting the Holy Spirit to them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's power, authority, and glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_west_and_the_rising_of_the_sun.htm">The West and the Rising of the Sun (East)</a></b><br>These geographical references symbolize the entirety of the earth, indicating the universal recognition of God's power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_raging_flood.htm">The Raging Flood</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's overwhelming and unstoppable intervention in human affairs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breath_of_the_lord.htm">The Breath of the LORD</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Spirit of God, indicating divine action and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_recognition_of_god's_glory.htm">Universal Recognition of God's Glory</a></b><br>God's power and glory are not confined to one nation or people but are recognized across the entire earth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_intervention.htm">The Power of God's Intervention</a></b><br>Like a raging flood, God's intervention is powerful and unstoppable, reminding us of His sovereignty over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The "breath of the LORD" signifies the active presence of the Holy Spirit in executing God's will and bringing about His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_reverence_for_god.htm">Fear and Reverence for God</a></b><br>The appropriate response to God's power and glory is a reverent fear, acknowledging His authority and majesty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Hope in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>In times of trouble, believers can find hope in the promise of God's powerful intervention and ultimate justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_59_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 59:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_59_19_God_s_protection_assurance.htm">How does Isaiah 59:19 inspire confidence in God's protection against adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_fear_the_LORD_in_Isa_59_19.htm">What does "fear the name of the LORD" mean in Isaiah 59:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_59_19_Eph_6_10-18_on_warfare.htm">How does Isaiah 59:19 connect with Ephesians 6:10-18 on spiritual warfare?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_apply_lift_a_standard.htm">How can believers apply "the Spirit of the LORD will lift a standard"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_59_19_uplift_in_trials.htm">In what ways can Isaiah 59:19 encourage us during times of spiritual attack?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_enemy_comes_in_like_a_flood.htm">What does Isaiah 59:19 mean by "the enemy comes in like a flood"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_59_19_God_s_power_protection.htm">How does Isaiah 59:19 reflect God's power and protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Isaiah_59_19.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Isaiah 59:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_59.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 59?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_eternal_punishment_just_for_sins.htm">How can eternal punishment be just for finite sins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_christianity_cause_guilt.htm">Why does Christianity make people feel guilty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_was_the_biblical_prophet_micah.htm">What was God's purpose in creating the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_constitutes_the_essence_of_evil.htm">What constitutes the essence of evil?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 59:19 Mean</div><b>So shall they fear the name of the LORD where the sun sets</b><p>&#8220;From the west they will fear the name of the LORD&#8221;.<p>&#8226;

When <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a> promises, &#8220;The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD,&#8221; it parallels this line: God&#8217;s fame will shine like dawn across nations.<p>&#8226; The phrase links with Jesus, &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).

At the end of days, His coming judgment will be just as forceful (<a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The flood also conveys cleansing. As the waters once washed away wickedness (<a href="/bsb/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6&#8211;8</a>), so His final visitation will sweep away rebellion and usher in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Driven by the breath of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;driven by the breath of the LORD&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Breath (ruach) is God&#8217;s Spirit.
