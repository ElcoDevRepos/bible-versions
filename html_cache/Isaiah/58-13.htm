The imagery of "turning your foot" suggests a deliberate action to refrain from activities that violate the sanctity of the Sabbath. Historically, the Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>), and breaking it was seen as a serious offense. The Sabbath was intended to be a day set apart for spiritual reflection and rest, aligning with God's rest on the seventh day of creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>from doing as you please on My holy day</b><br>This phrase highlights the call to set aside personal desires and activities that detract from the sacredness of the Sabbath. The focus is on aligning one's actions with God's will rather than pursuing self-interest. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the Sabbath was a communal experience, emphasizing worship and rest rather than individual pursuits. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of submission to God's authority and the prioritization of spiritual over worldly concerns.<p><b>if you call the Sabbath a delight</b><br>Here, the emphasis is on the attitude towards the Sabbath. Viewing the Sabbath as a "delight" suggests a heart posture that finds joy and fulfillment in observing God's commandments. This contrasts with a legalistic or burdensome view of the Sabbath. The concept of delighting in God's law is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous are described as those who find joy in meditating on God's law.<p><b>and the LORD&#8217;s holy day honorable</b><br>This phrase underscores the need to regard the Sabbath with reverence and respect. The term "holy" signifies something set apart for God, and honoring the Sabbath involves recognizing its divine purpose. In the historical context, the Sabbath served as a reminder of God's creation and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, where the Sabbath is linked to the Israelites' liberation from Egypt.<p><b>if you honor it by not going your own way</b><br>This part of the verse calls for self-denial and submission to God's will. It reflects the broader biblical principle of surrendering personal autonomy in favor of divine guidance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. The Sabbath is a time to cease from personal pursuits and focus on spiritual renewal and community worship.<p><b>or seeking your own pleasure</b><br>This phrase warns against using the Sabbath for self-indulgence. The focus is on setting aside personal gratification to honor God. This aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>, where the kingdom of God is described as righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, rather than mere physical enjoyment.<p><b>or speaking idle words</b><br>The final phrase cautions against frivolous or meaningless speech on the Sabbath. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power and importance of words, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>. The Sabbath is a time for edifying and purposeful communication, aligning with the call to let one's words be seasoned with grace (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

While the fasting of the day only required to be spiritualized, the sabbath observance needed both spiritualizing and increased strictness. From <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> we learn that the sabbatical years had been little observed during the later Jewish kingdom; and it would Seem from the present passage (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) that even the observance of the sabbath itself had been neglected. Not that the neglect was total. The sacrifices proper to the sabbath were duly offered - the "solemn assembly" was duly called and attended (<a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>); but during the rest of the day business flowed in its usual course - the complete sanctification of the entire day was set aside. We find a similar laxity prevalent after the return from the Captivity (<a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> treat it with reverence, as if it were "holy ground" (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). From doing thy pleasure; rather, <span class="accented">from doing thy business -</span> the same expression as in ver. 3. It is by "business," not by pleasure, that the sabbath was polluted both in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) and of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>, etc.). And call the sabbath a delight. This is the spiritualization of the sabbath - "to call" and feel it "a delight," a real satisfaction to the soul, not a weariness (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), as it was to many. And shalt honour him; rather, <span class="accented">and shalt honour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, which is made masculine here, as in <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>. The sabbath was to be honoured by men not pursuing their own ordinary ways, or engaging in their regular business, or even carrying on their ordinary everyday talk. Literally, the command is, not to "speak words;" but no Jews were ever such strict sabbatarians as to understand this as prohibiting <span class="accented">all</span> speech on the sabbath. Some have held that sabbatical talk should be scanty, limited, restrained as much as possible; but even for this there is no warrant. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the words uttered that is of real importance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/58-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you turn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your foot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7713;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
