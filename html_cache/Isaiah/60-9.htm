The "islands" often symbolize distant lands or nations in biblical literature, indicating the far-reaching impact of God's plan. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The waiting implies a sense of expectation and readiness to receive God's revelation and blessings.<p><b>with the ships of Tarshish in the lead</b><br>Tarshish is often associated with wealth and maritime trade, possibly referring to a location in the western Mediterranean, such as modern-day Spain. The mention of "ships of Tarshish" indicates the involvement of powerful and wealthy nations in God's plan. Historically, these ships were known for their long voyages and valuable cargo, symbolizing the bringing of resources and people to God's service. This can also be seen as a type of the Gentile nations coming to the light of Israel, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>.<p><b>to bring your children from afar</b><br>This phrase highlights the return of the exiles to Israel, a recurring theme in Isaiah. It signifies the gathering of God's people from distant lands, fulfilling prophecies of restoration and unity (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). This return is not just physical but also spiritual, as it represents a renewed relationship with God. It can also be seen as a type of the ultimate gathering of believers to Christ, as mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p><b>with their silver and gold</b><br>The mention of silver and gold emphasizes the wealth and honor that will accompany the return of God's people. These precious metals symbolize the value and glory that the nations will bring to God, reflecting the wealth of the nations being consecrated to Him. This can be connected to the prophecy in <a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7-8</a>, where the treasures of all nations are brought to fill God's house with glory.<p><b>to the honor of the LORD your God</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the gathering and the wealth: to honor God. It reflects the ultimate goal of all creation, which is to glorify the Creator. The honor given to God through the return of His people and the wealth of the nations signifies the acknowledgment of His supremacy and holiness. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's glory being revealed to all nations (<a href="/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3</a>).<p><b>the Holy One of Israel</b><br>This title for God emphasizes His unique and set-apart nature. It is a frequent designation in Isaiah, highlighting God's covenant relationship with Israel and His moral perfection. The holiness of God is a central theme in the Bible, calling His people to reflect His character (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This title also points to the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as He acts on their behalf.<p><b>for He has glorified you</b><br>The glorification of Israel is a result of God's action and favor. It signifies the restoration and exaltation of God's people, reflecting His faithfulness to His covenant. This glorification is not for Israel's sake alone but serves as a testament to God's power and faithfulness, drawing all nations to Him. It can also be seen as a type of the glorification of the Church, the spiritual Israel, as believers are transformed into the likeness of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>).<div

the islands will wait for Me</b><p>The phrase pictures distant coastlands&#8212;peoples seemingly beyond the edge of the map&#8212;standing in eager expectation of God&#8217;s next move. In Isaiah, &#8220;islands&#8221; are shorthand for Gentile nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>; 51:5). Here they are not resisting the Lord&#8217;s plan for Zion but leaning forward, waiting to participate. The scene anticipates the worldwide acknowledgment that Israel&#8217;s God alone reigns, just as <a href="/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a> invites the &#8220;roaring sea and all that fills it&#8221; to celebrate Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the ships of Tarshish in the lead</b><p>Tarshish was famed for deep-water merchant fleets that carried luxury goods (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>). By mentioning these ships first, Isaiah highlights both speed and prominence. The best maritime power of the day is pictured volunteering its resources for God&#8217;s agenda, echoing <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>, where &#8220;the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute.&#8221; Commerce is no longer self-serving; it bears God&#8217;s people and their cargo home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bring your children from afar</b><p>God promises a literal, physical return of Jewish exiles to their land. Earlier prophecies said the same (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>; 43:5-6). This regathering is comprehensive&#8212;&#8220;from afar&#8221; captures every longitude, affirming that no diaspora outpost is beyond His reach. Jesus echoed the certainty of this ingathering when He spoke of a future worldwide trumpet call that gathers the elect (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with their silver and gold</b><p>The returning sons and daughters do not come back empty-handed. Just as Israel left Egypt enriched (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>) and later returned from Babylon with Persian backing (<a href="/ezra/1-4.htm">Ezra 1:4-11</a>), so the final return will be financed by the nations. <a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7-8</a> foretells a day when &#8220;the treasures of all the nations will come,&#8221; underscoring that every ounce of wealth ultimately belongs to the Lord and will be redirected for His glory in Zion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the honor of the LORD your God</b><p>The procession&#8217;s goal is worship, not tourism. The wealth and the people converge on Jerusalem &#8220;to the honor of the LORD,&#8221; fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> where nations say, &#8220;Let us go up to the mountain of the LORD.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a> echoes the scene: &#8220;The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.&#8221; Everything culminates in God&#8217;s praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Holy One of Israel</b><p>Isaiah loves this title; it welds God&#8217;s moral perfection (&#8220;Holy One&#8221;) to His covenant loyalty (&#8220;of Israel&#8221;). His uniqueness guarantees the promise. Because He is holy, He cannot lie; because He is Israel&#8217;s, He will not abandon. See <a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14 and 43</a>:3 for the same reassuring blend of majesty and intimacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for He has glorified you</b><p>Zion herself becomes radiant because God has placed His glory upon her (<a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-2</a>). The transformation is so complete that the nations perceive it and respond. <a href="/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19-20</a> foretells a similar elevation: &#8220;I will give them praise and honor in every land where they were put to shame.&#8221; God&#8217;s glorifying work in His people draws worship from the world&#8212;a cycle of blessing that starts and ends with His initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a> paints a vivid, literal picture of the future restoration of Israel and the global recognition of the Lord. Distant nations eagerly line up to serve God&#8217;s purpose, premier fleets deliver the scattered family home, wealth pours in, and every detail spotlights the honor of the Holy One. The prophecy assures believers that God&#8217;s covenant promises stand untouched by time and that His glory, once poured out on Zion, will magnetically draw the ends of the earth to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/60.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The isles . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.">Isaiah 49:1</a>, the far-off maritime regions of the West.<p><span class= "bld">Ships of Tarshish.</span>--These are, as in <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm" title="And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant pictures.">Isaiah 2:16</a>, the first-class trading ships, whether trading with that country (Spain) or in the Indian Ocean.
