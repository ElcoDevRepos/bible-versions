In the context of Isaiah, this could refer to cities like Babylon or Moab, which were known for their arrogance and opposition to God. The imagery of a city reduced to rubble is a common biblical motif representing divine retribution (e.g., Jer. 51:37). Archaeological evidence from ancient Near Eastern cities shows layers of destruction, often attributed to divine judgment in biblical narratives.<p><b>the fortified town a ruin</b><br>Fortified towns were symbols of human strength and security. The destruction of such a town signifies the futility of relying on human defenses against divine will. Historically, cities like Jericho and Lachish were known for their fortifications, yet they fell when God decreed their downfall. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate sovereignty of God over human endeavors (Ps. 127:1).<p><b>The fortress of strangers is a city no more</b><br>The term "strangers" often refers to foreign nations or those outside the covenant community of Israel. This phrase indicates the downfall of foreign powers that opposed God's people. The destruction of their fortresses underscores the theme of God's protection over Israel and His ability to dismantle the power of nations that do not acknowledge Him (Isa. 13-23).<p><b>it will never be rebuilt</b><br>This finality emphasizes the completeness of God's judgment. The phrase suggests a permanent desolation, akin to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24-25). Historically, some cities, once destroyed, were never rebuilt, serving as lasting testimonies to divine judgment. This also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of all powers opposed to God, culminating in the eschatological vision of a new heaven and new earth where no such cities will exist (Rev. 21:1).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Represents human pride and rebellion against God.
