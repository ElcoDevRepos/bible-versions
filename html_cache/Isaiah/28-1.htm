Ephraim, representing the northern kingdom of Israel, is often used to denote the ten tribes. The "majestic crown" symbolizes the pride and self-glorification of the leaders and people. Drunkenness here is both literal and metaphorical, indicating moral and spiritual decay. The Bible frequently condemns drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) as it leads to a loss of self-control and judgment, which is evident in the leadership of Ephraim.<p><b>to the fading flower of his glorious splendor</b><br>The "fading flower" suggests the transient nature of human glory and achievements. Ephraim's splendor, once vibrant, is now withering due to their unfaithfulness and indulgence. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages that compare human glory to grass or flowers that wither (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10-11</a>). It serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly pride and the need for reliance on God.<p><b>set on the summit above the fertile valley</b><br>The geographical reference to a "summit above the fertile valley" likely points to Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, which was situated on a hill overlooking a fertile region. This location was strategic and prosperous, contributing to the pride of its inhabitants. However, their physical elevation and prosperity could not protect them from divine judgment. This reflects the biblical theme that true security and prosperity come from God, not from human achievements or geographical advantages (<a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><b>the pride of those overcome by wine</b><br>The "pride" of Ephraim is directly linked to their indulgence in wine, symbolizing excess and moral corruption. This pride leads to their downfall, as seen in other biblical narratives where pride precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The imagery of being "overcome by wine" suggests a loss of control and discernment, which is spiritually analogous to being led astray by sin. This serves as a warning against the dangers of excess and the importance of humility and sobriety in one's walk with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, often representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The warning was clearly uttered before the capture of Samaria by Salmaneser, or, more probably, by Sargon, and paints in vivid colours--reminding us in part of <a href="/context/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4-6</a>, not without a side glance at the like vices in Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>)--the license into which the capital of the northern kingdom had fallen. With a bold personification the words paint (1) the banquet with its revellers, crowned, as in the later days of Rome, with wreaths of flowers; and (2) Samaria itself as such a wreath, once beautiful, now fading, crowning the "head" of the "fat," or luxuriant, valley (literally, <span class= "ital">valley of oils, </span>or, <span class= "ital">fat things</span>) in which the revellers held their feasts. Cheyne notes that the inscription of Salmaneser records that the tribute of Jehu consisted of bowls, cups, and goblets of gold, as illustrating the luxury of the palace of Samaria (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 41). The LXX. strangely renders the last clause, "drunk without wine," as if from a reminiscence of <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm" title="Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.">Isaiah 29:9</a>, and gives the "hirelings of Ephraim" instead of "drunkards."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - A WARNING TO SAMARIA.

In the present chapter he returns to the condition of things in his own time and among his own people. After a brief warning, addressed to Samaria, he turns to consider the condition of Judah, which he accuses of following the example of Samaria, of perishing through self-indulgence and lack of knowledge (vers. 7-12). He then proceeds to expostulate seriously with the "rulers of Jerusalem," on whom lies the chief responsibility for its future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the drunkards</span>, The "drunkards of Ephraim," or of the ten tribes, were at once intoxicated with wine (<a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>; <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) and with pride (<a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>).

The "glorious beauty" of Samaria was a beauty of magnificent luxury. "Summer" and "winter houses," distinct each from the other (<a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); "ivory palaces" (<a href="/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); a wealth of "gardens, vineyards, fig-orchards, and olive yards" (<a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>); residences of "hewn stone" (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>); feasts enlivened with "the melody of viols" (<a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>); "beds of ivory" (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>); "wine in bowls" (<a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); "chief ointments" (<a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); constituted a total of luxurious refinement beyond which few had proceeded at the time, and which Isaiah was fain to recognize, in a worldly point of view, as "glorious" and "beautiful." But the beauty was of a kind liable to fade, and it was already fading under the sirocco of Assyrian invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Which are on the head of the fat valleys</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which is on the head</span> (or, <span class="accented">which decks the head</span>) <span class="accented">of the rich valley</span>. Samaria was built on a hill of an oval form, which rose up in the midst of a fertile valley shut in by mountains. The prophet identifies the valley with the kingdom itself, and then personifies it, and regards its head as crowned by the fading flower of Samaria's beauty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/28-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah! alas! ha!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the majestic</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1348.htm">Strong's 1348: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arrogance, majesty, ornament</span><br /><br /><span class="word">crown</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1496;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;e&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5850.htm">Strong's 5850: </a> </span><span class="str2">A crown, wreath</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Ephraim&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">drunkards,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ik&#183;k&#333;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7910.htm">Strong's 7910: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intoxicated, as a, state, a habit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the fading</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5034.htm">Strong's 5034: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wilt, to fall away, fail, faint, to be foolish, wicked, to despise, disgrace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">flower</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
